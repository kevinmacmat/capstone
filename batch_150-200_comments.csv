PS 18 is the third school in 5 years that my son has gone to because I have decided to pull him out due to my discontent of the lack of tolerance and understanding of my son’s needs. Thanks to Mr House, my son this year became so much independent at home with his homeworks, my son would be reinforced at school with very positive words such as “ You can do it” or “ You can do your best” which he would repeat at home all the time. My son for the first time ever met the standard math test at his grade level. I think Mr House communicating with me everyday to provide feedback as to how the day was going with my child was very helpful to me on communicating back to my son’s doctors but also helped me find ways on how to improve my son’s behavior in order to help achieve a successful academic year and help him learn. Mr House tries as a team work with the parent to push the child to their fullest potential. I also found the school to be very responsive, cordial and tend to my son’s needs or my request very timely. It seems like all he staff care for the students.

I am now going to college. I had the best time of my life in IS52! I met so many people, learned to network with others and I wrote my college essay about it. I wonder if Ms. Paumig, Ms. Ackert, Ms. Bracie and Mr. Vilson still teach there. This school is definitely a ""hidden gem"" in New York City. I really miss this school. As for the anonymous that claimed that this is the worst school, I agree with you on one thing only, there are many fights but you\'ll find that everywhere, literally. I had many fights in that school and it made me evolve into the man I am now. It also gave me insight that life isn\'t the ""Utopian dream"" I once thought about. I will always hold this school dearly in my heart. I would really like to speak to Ms. Paumig as I did write my college essay around an event that happened. Anyways, this school is great!!', ""During my tender years going tp JHS 52 in the early 70's, most of it was spent fighting prejudiced students and faculty alike.I am of Puerto Rican descent, but I had to fight dominicans who played the race card to justify their own prejudices. They influenced the local constabulary there into their ignorance, & it was quite arduous going day by day to suffer their abuse. I managed to graduate from there to go to a trade school  graduated. but left me nowhere but a seething hatred for certain students & the public school system. I hope the entire school system has changed & the attitudes of the students as well."", ""This school is amazing! The Principal Ms. Leon knows her stuff. She is great at listening to her students' and teachers needs. The school band and all the extracurricular activities make the school look great. I really enjoy how discipline is handled by Mr. Benitez!!! AMAZING- Would definitely send my child here."", 'To be straight to the point,this is the worst middle school I have ever seen.Many fights start inside the school sometimes and even outside in the parking lot.Some kids even smoke marijuana and do extremely bad things to the staff and principals,even the teachers on the last days like baby oil on staircases and fart bombs.The good students are like camouflage for the ghetto students.Teachers sometimes are dramatically disrespectful and may take it like a joke but the students don\'t.You may find this rare and only if you are well communicated with teachers,like a friend.The school baby\'s you to wear uniform and if you don\'t you get your parents called.Seriously?An 8th graders parents called for UNIFORM?Don\'t even mention the staff.They are always acting like the school is Dominican Republic and playing Spanish music in the cafeteria,which irritates me.They push students around and are annoying.Some students here have been dating and they are in the sixth grade smoking hookah.I have seen MANY pictures.In the cafeteria,we even have separated places,like one side is for students to eat breakfast and one for who isn\'t .In addition to that,each grade has assigned sections,which is stupid.The reviews here are all lies and I feel absolutely brave and proud of myself that I have survived almost 3 years.Some kids in relationships even bully you that they are in a love relationship and how you\'re a loner.Also,don\'t forget the after school program.The after school programs are disrupting and they baby you and give you a horrible experience in there.They also have the same behavior as the school and is annoying.Did I mention the environment after school?The stores are crowded with death-threatening kids telling you to move.The stores are even associated with drugs too.Some people drive there motorcycles and cars letting 8th graders go do drugs with them.Overall,I would give this school a 3 out of 10.The good comments are only from the fake ghetto people that ""fit in"" stating that this is the best school and you will meet amazing people.The only good people here are the teachers.', ""Dear Anonymous,\nNot to be rude since this is your opinion,students personal life such as their agreement to participate in drug use has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the school itself. It comes from your conciseness and being told  that doing drugs is ok, not that we do drugs or support its use.In case you didnt realize there are 2 other schools there so the drug user will be hard to detect.  Being separated in the cafeteria is a form of organization and helps ensure that each kid in every grade is served lunch. Being separated  during breakfast helps make cleaning up for the high schools and lunch easier.Students that get to breakfast and don't eat in the morning can catch up with  work.The music during lunch is not put on everyday and was requested by students.Love life, another irrelevant subject linked to the school. If you pay attention to the love life of students then you are not mature enough to state the facts on what you think the school  is actually like. After schools try there best and push us forward to learn academic skills and social skills  we need in life. The environment after school plants trees and flowers within the community and help students value the importance of keeping the environment safe. Uniform help prevents judgement within the students and by enforcing the rules no judgmental comments would be made.The stores, another once again  irrelevant topic to support your claim on the school. Students are meant to control their behavior AT SCHOOL!  What they do outside of school is their business  and does not support the claim that the school is a bad one. As to the teachers, since you are anonymous  call out the teachers. Also as for the senior prank that was a one time thing and the students responsible for it have taken their consequence as of last year.  Finally if you behind the screen took the  time to analyze important things at school such as academic scores and or events happening like honor roll society then you would realize the school may not be the best but it is certainly not the worst. I mean how would you know?This is the only  middle school you have attended.

My mother is an educator in Maryland and she is thrilled at the quality of education her grandsons receive. The principal is kind and truly values the parents. She is always giving the parents and kids a vision that they will all graduate college! The staff are very loving to the students but also have very good class management. We highly recommend this school.', 'I went to P.S. 98 my teachers were Ms. Valencia, Mr. Perez, Mr Santiago. As a graduate from there I do feel that this school can do so much better. When I used to go teachers were engaged and knowledge was power as we used it. I miss my schools as I live in FL and my kids are so behind on their education. NYC is way more advanced than what my kids are learning.', 'The principal of this school is the worst. She has zero knowledge of how students learn. She treats her staff horribly. She is extremely fake and is only concerned with keeping her job, not the students.', 'I use to go there from 1982-1987. I had great teachers Mrs. Rivera(3rd grade), Mr. Steve (k), Ms. Guerra (2nd grade), Mrs. Monserrat (1st grade) and Mr. Lamor (4th grade) were stern but were great nonetheless. Mr. Shapiro the principal was also very nice and charismatic. My kids on the other hand my now 17 yrs old and 8 yr old have had very bad experiences. Most of the teachers then and now are horrible and lazy (that\'s 85%) of them while the other 15% excels to provide excellence. When my 17 yr old was 8ys old  the teacher she had couldn\'t stand him and I almost beat her. So they changed his class to Mrs. Martinez (which) is still there and she said the contrary, she also said he just needed a little bit more help. I also got him evaluated and found out that due to that he had a high level of anxiety and ADHD. Now fast forward 10 yrs later my 2nd son is in the same school, going through the same thing. He\'s also getting left back just like it happened 10yrs ago. I was lucky back then the school was in need of improvement and my son got transferred out. This time they aren\'t and I have been trying for a whole year to transfer him out and I can\'t. The last draw was getting my son evaluated because he\'s very distracted and hyperactive. Maybe now I will get him transfer out that hell hole. But before his IEP got done I had to call the district and speak to the child and family advocate cause I was told that ""They were to busy and backed up to do his IEP evaluation."" Mind you it was done last year. I would recommend NOT TO ENROLL ANY CHILD IN THAT SCHOOL. Today my 17yr old is thriving thanks to Muscota New School they are awesome!

Parents are concerned about class size, school safety, teacher support and wellness, and high stakes testing. There is no tutoring, no disciplinary system to speak of, and the teachers are within a wide range of emotional stress and burnout. They clearly love and care about the students but cannot give them what they need in this climate of data walls and the curriculum that doesn't seem to be developmentally appropriate for any but the highest achievers. \n\nThere seems to be some seriously shady business.

06M223,"[""I graduated from Mott Hall back in 2016, and I honestly have a hard time recommending the school to anyone who wants to go there. Many of the students show little to no respect for each other, and the staff isn't much better either. The students were often rude and disrespectful to each other and showed little care for the work. Other students like myself who actually wanted to be there would often get lumped in with the rest of the class as the teachers were very fond of group punishment. Very frequently it would only be a handful of students who were misbehaving, but the teachers would just hand out a whole classroom detention during lunch. The staff would use any excuse to take away a students lunch period, from frankly BS class detentions to putting someone aside because there was a tiny amount of white on their 95% black sneakers. Many of the teachers loved to scream at the students for ten to twenty minutes, and would frequently hold up the class over the most menial things. The dean in particular actually wore out her vocal cords because she would scream so much during the lunch period, and was so loud that I could hear her fits from the floor below. \n\nThe environment here is very toxic and doesn't encourage learning in the slightest. Any student who goes in hopeful about the school will quickly have their mind changed by how bad some of the students and staff are. There are some teachers here that I've absolutely loved, but I can't say that I liked the majority of them.

It’s infuriating when the professionally behaving kids get the goat for what the subverters wish to do. Heck—even the administration acts entitled. They impose every unfair rule that they wish to impose mainly to just be sadists. I understand that students should dress professionally in their uniforms, but on dress down days, the rules essentially makes dress down days seem more like a regular day. There is visible abuse in fund usage and censorship is high at the school (most visible in the yearbook). There are some amazing teachers at the school—most of which have left due to circumstances in life. The school has produced a graduating class with many of whom goes to mediocre schools but the professionally behaved students go on to good high schools. This is a visible sign that this school will fail. \n\nEssintially, this school is a toxic environment due to the conflicts between the administration and the students and isolated issues in these two parties.

Also, really after you spent some time in the school, the space doesn't seem bad at all. It is a very good school😊"", 'Can I please get A like for our Mr.Fernandez who left this year?', ""This school is horrible. As an alumn I do not recommend sending your child to this school.

I is sort of small and that is not their fault though. The teachers are strict but teach well and I would recommend this school.', ""Unfortunately the school is decline because of lack of leadership. Many good teachers have left because of the current and previous administration. There are wonderful hard working students and teachers that deserve better. The principal is not responsive to parents with legitimate complaints. Let's face it, the students of The Mott Hall School for the most part have parents that value education and have a good handle on what it takes to accelerate students. The new principal lacks imagination and treats parents with contempt. Often takes advantage of language barriers to shun and dismiss parents. When she got to the school her only way of solving problems with students was suspensions and detentions violating students and parents rights to due process. She doesn't have a grip on supervising teachers or good pedagogical understanding. The new superintendent was on point with the quality review. This is not a good grade for what once use to be a gem, not only of the district, but of the entire city. In order to return the school to it's past glory it is in desperate need of a principal that understands gifted education, and cares about their futures. This is not the present case. Although she has a PhD. in education it is not reflected in her practice, communication, strategic planning or vision for the school. The Mott Hall School has become a rudderless ship."", ""Mott Hall is a good school overall. But like all other schools, there are ups and downs. Some good things about this school is that a lot of teachers are really great. For example, Ms. Burke (she left this year), Ms. Brandes, Mr. Fernandez,Ms. Boros, and many others. They are open to tutoring or extra help during lunch hours or after school, and are very supportive in raising your grades. Also, you can make friends very easily. Our school is mostly a bully free environment, and if there is a problem, it can be cleared up pretty quickly. Another good thing is that we are learning on a very high scale. In sixth grade, you are learning on a seventh grade scale, seventh grade on an eighth grade scale, and eighth graders, on a ninth grade scale. For some children, this is two fast paced. In sixth grade, we kind of skipped the basics, so I fell back a bit. The key to achieving in Mott Hall is too stay organized, keep color coded notebooks, and sections in your binders, and have a good format for taking notes and studying. The other key element is doing you're homework. Yeah, its hard, but deal with it. If you start your year not doing any homework, you will not do well. Some things that need to be improved in this school is some of the faculty problems, some teachers do not respect the students. In one instance, a certain teacher, who I wrote a letter in french for (one of our assignments), called it trash, and gave back everyones papers calling them disgraceful. Also we have a small gym, and small classrooms. A lot of times it is either WAY too hot, or WAY to cold in the classrooms. Another downside is that the special ed kids run around the halls and banging on doors and screaming in the staircases. I am a current eighth grader at Mott Hall and going through the high school process, and I have to say that the guidance counseler and teachers are really helpful and supportive in helping you in any way. When I graduate, I will be very sad too leave, and miss everything. If you are thinking about going to this school, you will have a great experience. It will be tough at times, but when you get through them, it will be great."", 'Sadly mr.ferny left this year', 'The Mott Hall School is quite the advanced academic school in the city of New York. But this school has some flaws and some goods. \n\nThe Good\n\n1. Above average standards for this school.\n\nThe Curriculum provided is considered above the BOE\'s standards, and we are considered a gifted and talented school.\n\n2. Teachers, teachers, teachers,\n\nWhile they may be a nuisance at times, the Teachers are nice (mostly) and they provide guidance to students if needed. Some honorable mentions I like to make are teachers like Ms.Torres, Ms.Whyman, Ms.Boros, Mr.Fernandez, Ms.Burke, and Mr.Vigrass. I personally think these teachers are the building blocks of the school. (Unlike there more superior counterparts) *cough the assistant principal and principal cough*\n\n3. Somewhat extracurricular activities.\n\n6th graders are offered the choice of 5 activities they can do twice a week during 8th period.Activities rotate every 3 months.1 is the most preferred and 5 is the least. I believe the 5 are rotational chess, permanent chess (6 months, god knows what they were thinking when naming that), stock market, collage and film producing. Speaking of chess, there is a club that goes from 2-4 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. They go to junior nationals every year and have free snacks during their sessions. \n\n4. The Chess Club\n\nA follow up to the chess club, they raise the funds by selling chocolates for $1. After nationals, no more. Pretty sure the school\'s budget funds part of the trip, but kids who wish to go must pay their airfare ticket or whatever. Usually $150-$250.\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. The small space disadvantage.\n\nSpace is limited, especially since there is no auditorium and gym. Also the gym teacher Ms.Molina teaches most her lessons in the yard, she locks the equipment when it is not appropriately used (reasonable), and lastly she seems nice inside, but is a real pitbull when you pull her trigger. Additionally we have to walk to another school (mainly A.Philip Randolph and P.S. 129) to have things like ceremonies, ndi performances, and general announcements. \n\n2. The true ""call of the wild""\n\nThe special ed kids are mostly bad. They are loud, bang on the doors of teachers during instructing in classes, and they are most responsible for the lockup of sports equipment at recess. \n\n3. The bathroom battle\nThe situation is considered bad because with the girls bathroom, girls would be texting and using their cell phones and the boys bathroom is usually trashed.\n\n4. THE LOCKER SITUATION\n\nOh the horror of this situation i\'m about to present.\n\nIndeed, since there isn\'t enough spacing provided in the building we are forced to share lockers. Sounds reasonable? Wrong, because a locker is shared with 4 people in a cramped spacing. It is considered hallway horror when the 7th and 8th graders make there daily rounds in their lockers.\n\n5. No sports clubs (pretty self explanatory)\n\n6. The french teacher is mean and annoying. Only god knows why that old bag ended up teaching here. She deserves to teach in one of those really bad schools. Maybe that\'s why we\'re here.\n\n7. Fighting and the common use of profanity.\n\nThere would be fighting once in a while and there would be general disruption and unrest. Meanwhile profanity would be commonly used, but teachers let it slide.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nWhile this school has one of the best academic standards in the city of New York, leadership and a serious staff should put fixing this school as a first priority. This school doesn\'t have all the potential it used to have 29 years ago. Now if you ask me, we can either fix this as a community or let it all go down the drain.

06M278,"['When we first started thinking about schools several years ago we didn\'t even know 278 existed.    But lo and behold here was this rising, well-respected school right in our area, and we chose it over several other options.  We\'ve been very happy with our experience so far. \n\n\nThe school is now quite popular in its zone (one of the only schools in all of Upper Manhattan to have a waitlist) and for good reason.  Wonderful teachers, attentive administration, diverse programs including plenty of art and music.  The shared cafeteria and gym with PS 18 do present some challenges but the combination of the two schools also works positively for things like the alternate ""wellness in the schools"" menu and the unusually good auditorium (complete with stage and theatre lighting). \n\nIf you are considering attending here and want to learn more than you\'ve seen on the school tour or on the DOE website, don\'t sit on 219th or 220th St and focus on the industrial surroundings and bare schoolyard.  (The outside of the school is admittedly less attractive than many.)  You won\'t see any of the kids on those blocks outside of school hours.  The actual heart of the school on evenings and weekends is Isham Park, which is in the middle of the school\'s zone and where many of the students play off-hours.  (Second local hang-out for spotting 278 kids -- the top-notch Indian Road Playground in Inwood Hill Park).  Given that much of the school year is in winter or rainy weather, the plain yard is less of an issue than you might think during the school day and the spacious and well maintained inside of the school is very much up to par.\n\nBeing at a zoned school certainly has its advantages when you consider the minimal ""commute"" (walking 10 minutes instead of a long bus ride)  and the fact that you run into schoolmates everywhere in the neighborhood.   Afterschool options are many (at the school, at the Y, at Bread & Yoga all very popular) and also in the neighborhood. \n\nThe school does have traditional elements like homework and uniforms, but if you like that sort of thing you will be very pleased.  Our child seems to be doing well academically and we\'re looking forward to next year.']"

The principal is an adorable, cute, older woman who is very involved with her school. She knows each and everyone of her students and also teaches the incoming 6th grade history class.  She works hard to make sure that her students are provided with a positive learning experience by cultivating an environment that rewards students for their hard work. She also provides students with an outlet through extracurricular activities involving the arts and sports.

Scores are routinely boosted and answers to tests posted in advance; some teachers don't grade or look at the student's work, others seem to look and then, if the score is too low, arbitrarily assign higher grades, if not outright falsify. Perhaps this is for fear of deleterious consequences for themselves -- the outcome is the same. There is a percentage of high school kids who read and write on the third or fourth grade level, at best, yet receive 90s in ELA. Ditto for math, where they are far behind other kids and schools. Plagiarism is accepted, and perhaps encouraged. The grammar spoken and written by some of the teachers is atrocious. State tests? Who knows! It's hard to believe the posted scores, and makes one wonder if tests aren't altered. The administration and Ms. Drysdale cast a blind eye towards these 'anomalies'. What, exactly, is CCAA preparing these kids for? If the spelling and grammar of the comments from those who have graduated is an indication, certainly not college or the real world.

(The principal) clearly has a couple of students that she gives perks to, whether or not they deserve it. There have been several occasions in which students who do bad things are not penalized when reported just because the faculty likes said student. In addition, her priorities are all over the place; (uniform enforcement above organization in general) \n\n the ASSISTANT PRINCIPLES,  have very tight schedules and do not give student the time and consideration that is needed for classes, tutoring, and etc.. They want us to do better (which is appreciated), yet they do not provide assistance in it. The assistant principles and the main principal need to have better communication within themselves. \n\n{as for the} COUNSELOR mostly involved with the upperclassmen, it\'s very hard to say that she helps students in difficult situations. She belittles, doesn\'t provide answers, is quite impatient/misunderstanding, and victimizes the people when they come to her for help. Although she is supportive in some situations, its pretty easy to say that she forces her opinions on people (she doesn\'t hold back in telling you that the decisions you are making for your future are wrong, in her opinion).\n\nMoving on to the TEACHERS, they definitely care about the students, although it must be said that some are biased leaning towards their favorites.\n\nThe teachers don\'t discipline the students that need to be disciplined; for example, if a student is doing or saying something inappropriate towards another student, and said student ""tattle tells"", teachers will and have said ""nobody likes a tattle tale.""\n\nThe STUDENTS: the middle school and high school have different issues that need to be addressed. First, middle school and high school are two very different things and experiences, therefore, they should be kept separate. \n\nMIDDLE SCHOOLERS are young, vulnerable, and naive. Times are changing, and so are the kids. Some are meaner, some are maturing way earlier, and the rules need to be better enforced to make sure that no kid is belittled and ridiculed by other kids. It\'s impossible to stop it all, but it can definitely be controlled and reduced by a landslide.\n\nAs for HIGH SCHOOL, kids are more mature and they need to be better informed on general knowledge. For example, health classes need to be taken more seriously.It is important that young adults are informed of risks, illnesses, and alternatives that life has to offer in a general sense. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are things that need to be thoroughly addressed.\n\nIn addition, high schoolers influence the middle schoolers tremendously.... Cursing, fighting, bullying, and etc is different for middle school and high school. There should be different rules for both, but due to the lack of our own building, there is no space, time, or separation between the different grades. There are territorial issues between the THREE SCHOOLS. I repeat, THREE SCHOOLS in one 5-floor building, of which we only own 1 and a half for over 500 students in just 1 of the schools. No one has enough attitude or authority to fight for the space that is rightfully ours at certain times, and within requested scheduling.\n\nOverall, things just need to be more professional.\n\nLast but not least, the general SCHOOL is not diverse, nor united. There are little to no activities (dances, assemblies, clubs, sports). The school is still trying to bear its ground, but at almost a decade old, it\'s safe to say that things are moving way too slow. It\'s time to develop good structure, good organization, and fix the school overall.\n\nDespite all the REALISM (or what you might consider negativity), it must be said that the academics are really great. Generally, students get the help they need, and the program really makes sure no one gets left behind in education.

My children have been given frequent tests and pop quizzes, sometimes graded in red ink. And for the coming year, the school will do away with looping except in kindergarten and first grade. The homework load in my kids' and my friends' kids' grades is very heavy, with a strong emphasis on publisher-created worksheets. The school's former emphasis on social justice and on educating the whole child has faded in the pursuit of higher test scores.

Within these small numbers, teachers come from various ethnicities and bring forward a variety of different experiences.', ""Proud Muscota Parent\n\nHmm, “look elsewhere.” It was not easy to find Muscota, but when I did, I couldn't be happier. Most progressive schools required families to pay tuition to have their child attend. Muscota does not.  My first impression of this school was during a tour. I had spent months researching progressive schools around the city and visited those I thought would be a good fit for my daughter. \n\nDuring the tour at Muscota, no matter the classroom I entered, I could hear students engaged in conversations, working independently, or involved in collaborative play. It didn’t have the feel of a traditional school. Students seemed enthusiastic and engaged in their own learning.  There was a warm feeling across the school that I had not seen in other schools I’d visited. I saw evidence of student work products displayed around the room or hanging from lights.  I knew immediately that this was the place I’d want my daughter to attend.\n\nIn the end, unquestionably, Muscota was my first choice. The school offered a balance of academics, social and, more importantly a progressive philosophy. \n\nSince then, my daughter has flourished. She is receiving a well rounded education, that shows her academic as well as her artistic growth.  She is assigned projects based on interest, that we work on at home. She once expressed that she loved her school and didn’t know why anyone would ever want to be absent. The homework she was doing at night prepared her to take state assessments. There was limited evidence that suggested she was being instructed on how to take a test. They read books as a class that engaged my daughter in wanting to read more books by the author. Regardless of what others believe about Muscota’s progressive philosophy, I know that my daughter will be well prepared to meet the demands of the 21st Century."", ""As a parent of a 1st grade kid at Muscota, I must say that Muscota's academic standards are not lacking in any way. The school is looking to improve, yes - because the teachers are caring professionals. Why would they look to stay the same? Of COURSE the school only wants to get better and better.\n\nHappy parent of a 1st grader."", 'This year one of our daughters graduates from Muscota as the other starts her journey there in kindergarten. That we have another six years at Muscota gives us great comfort, since it feels like a second home. \n\n\n\nI am writing because, between researching elementary schools seven years ago and spending the last two years researching middle schools, I have spent hundreds of hours talking to parents, researching websites, and touring over twenty schools. I am inspired by how parents share information. We are all in the same boat. Every NYC family has to navigate the treacherous waters of school choice. It makes this big city feel like a small town. We should take solace that college admissions will be a breeze compared with finding the right kindergarten for our children. While there is not one right school for all children, once you find the right school for your child, and your family, you will know it. We are so fortunate and grateful that we found the right school for our daughter and for our family, and that it is a seven minute walk from our home. \n\n\n\nWe are not yet authorities on middle schools, but we do know Muscota inside and out, because that\'s the kind of school it is. It WANTS families to know it, engage with it, and grow with it. A school is only as strong as its inhabitants and Muscota is a thriving community of love, learning, and discovery. We wish Muscota could extend to high school because it offers the kind of education that has finally made it to the front covers of every newspaper and teaching journal in the world. It is progressive, rigorous, responsive, diverse, and child-centered. It is WHOLE. \n\n\n\nMuscota has forever shaped the way our daughter sees, investigates, and reflects the world. Some of its trademarks include: \n\n\n\nTHE ARTS. At Muscota students learn about the world THROUGH the arts. The arts are not an appendage, but are rather the heart of the school\'s rigorous and creative collaboration. Sasha teaches sculpture, perspective, self-portrait, architecture, 2D design, and doll/puppet making by connecting each to texts the students are reading, concepts they are grappling with in math and science, and buildings in their neighborhood. In Megan\'s music class students compose songs about human anatomy and celebrate Mayan, Irish, Chinese, and Dutch culture through songs (sung in their native language). In Heather\'s dance class students explore world history through gumboot dances, tutting, and solo/partnering choreography. Students start playwriting in kindergarten with Dayna and graduate to fully produced self-written and Shakespearean plays by fifth grade. The students\' understanding of character, dialogue, conflict, context, figurative speech, and plot is extraordinary, thanks to drama with Dayna. \n\n\n\nCOMMUNITY. Muscota values community. Rituals and traditions are scheduled weekly and monthly to celebrate and extend classroom learning into the entire school and Inwood/Washington Heights community. Events include Monday morning town meeting, Inwood Park hikes, Family Breakfast, Mad Hatter\'s Ball, Candlelight Night, Winter Ice Skating Trip, State Fair, Talent Show, Pi Day, Eco-Fest, Spring Shakespeare Production, Spring Auction, Field Day, Mini Mall, Fifth Grade Overnight Adventure, Moving On, and Curriculum Nights. Students visit the nearby Bronx Zoo, Botanical Garden, Dyckman Farmhouse, as well as head downtown to the Joyce Theater, Tenement Museum, Juilliard, and the Museum of Natural History. \n\n\n\nPARENTAL INVOLVEMENT. Parental involvement is encouraged and essential to the thriving environment. Parent-led initiatives were behind a playground upgrade, cafeteria overhaul, state of the art auditorium sound system, science program, yoga program, garden plot, and countless other enrichment opportunities. Parents work closely with teachers and the administration. Communication is clear and comprehensive, accomplished through backpacked written correspondence, e-mail, the website, phone and in person through monthly meetings with Principal Camille Wallin and the Parents\' Association. Parents are included in their child\'s learning through conferences with teachers. Evening and weekend workshops include topics such as nutrition, the arts, literacy, science, math, testing, and parenting support.\n\n\n\nRIGOR. We love what our daughter comes home with each night. Her homework is challenging and engaging. She reads a novel a week independently, suited to her interests, as well as a novel/non-fiction book a month with her class and yet another in her after-school program. Her math homework keeps our entire family on our toes and entertained. She has learned math concepts through Mancala, Chess, card games, and the Salvadori program. This year her teacher Lauren\'s Culture of Proof tenet: ""convince yourself, convince a friend, convince a skeptic"" has changed the way we talk at the dinner table and the way I teach in my college classroom. We cherish the looping that Muscota is known for. Students, or ""scholars"" as Principal Camille calls them, stay with each teacher for two years. Muscota\'s teachers know, honor, respect, and celebrate how each student learns. Recently our daughter\'s classmate taught the class about rainforest deforestation through an interactive Minecraft presentation. \n\n\n\nThe school day spans from 8:30am to 3:10pm and offers early drop off as well as outstanding after-school programs. Partnerships with the nearby Bread & Yoga, Uptown Sports, and Nagle YM&YWHA also provide families with flexibility and enrichment. The school is safe, the kids are safe, and bullying simply does not exist. \n\n\n\nMuscota is responsible, in great part, for how our daughter thinks, problem solves, communicates with friends and family, and engages with the world. It is a gem of a school.', 'February 2014\nNYC Parent\n\nI took many tours as I was searching for a school that was a right fit for my child. Believe me when I say no two schools were alike.\n\nIf you are looking at this, then you probably have done your homework and know that Muscota is not a traditional school. \n\nConfidence, Self Assuredness and Strength of Character are elements of a Muscota child. Where else would a strange parent visiting a child\'s second home be greeted by an eloquent 5 year old who welcomes and invites them into his classroom?\n\nIn today\'s day and age most people communicate via text and email. Every day, I encounter adults with a lack of socialization skills that is key in this global society. Muscota children have a nurturing environment to facilitate in building key interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, skills that you can\'t learn from a textbook.\n\nMuscota\'s foundation is its community. Strong family involvement is key to its founding and continued vision.\n\nMuscota is one of the few schools that wants parental involvement and input. From the first encounter during a tour with Principal Camille Wallin, I was impressed by the human and personal approach of the faculty and administration. ""Do you have a moment? I want to hear your thoughts on the tour? What could we have done better? What did you like?"" I was shocked that a principal of an urban public school would want the feedback of a person she just met.\n\nIt is important to note high family involvement is the key at this school. It\'s not required but Muscota follows Mayor DeBlasio\'s tenet, parents are stakeholders in the school system and have a serious say on things that affect their child.\n\nNow that doesn\'t mean that you can complain or pick and choose what you want for your child but they have an ear open to the parents. The administrative staff have their hands full balancing the ever-changing focuses of the DOE while fighting to retain the philosophy and vision of the founding parents and administration. this dance is not an easy one but with the support of parents and families, the staff work hard to maintain Muscota\'s character and beliefs.\n\nParents should come to the administration and faculty with constructive solutions or ideas that will enhance not only their child\'s experience but also the other children in the community.\n\nMuscota is a small school with a big heart. It is not only your child(ren) who will be enrolled but also your family who will be welcomed into the Muscota home. Its a lasting relationship well past the years of attendance.', ""I recall this situation, believe it or not I just saw this response.  I am the parent. MY child did NOT feel comfortable standing in front of the classroom and stating her feelings. Adults as caregivers must  validate that we indeed hear a a child's fears and insecurities, this absolutely  VITAL for trust. If you don't approach the child and ask how she/he feels stating her feelings in front of a group, then it is both invalidating her fears and magnifying them, in front of an audience, and leaving her open for judgement and criticism by her peers which can lead to more issues.""]"

They engage the students in positive, productive ways and they also gave Luke personal attention to his specific needs. He also had the opportunity to participate in a special math and computer science program. These were/are fantastic opportunities.

He has been very happy at this school and we are sad to be leaving, time has gone by so fast.  First impressions last and the school has a friendly vibe and the hallways and classrooms are light, airy and full of projects and paintings done by the students.  My son and I spent some time in the classrooms observing when we were considering the school and all of the children were eager to tell us just how great their school was and how much they loved their teachers.  I had the wonderful opportunity of spending time with some of the teachers at a camping trip and got to see first hand just how enthusiastic, energetic and dedicated they are to their craft.  They draw out the best in every child with endless encouragement and understanding of every childs needs. The Principal, Ms. Heller is very approachable and passionate about the school as are all of the staff and I have never had a problem communicating with the school or the staff as needed.  My sons education has exceeded our expectations and helped him to grow into a responsible and mature young man over the past 3 years.  We have never had a problem with bullying or safety and I would highly recommend this school to all.', 'I graduated from MS324 in 2010. I love this school unconditionally and I know that when I have my children someday, this is the school I would send my children to. I just graduated high school and many say that high school are the best years of your life, but to me, middle school (MS324) were the best years of my life. In 2007, all incoming 6th graders were shy and scared - which makes sense after going to a whole new school and atmosphere than the previous school you attended, in which you were there for 6-7 years. The school welcomed me and everyone else with open arms. The way that you had at least one staff member who was your friend was a great feeling, and you grew to become very close to your teacher too. I met my best friend in middle school and now we\'re going to the same college in the Fall! Literally every staff member cared for every single student at 324, and I know that it seems like I\'m just writing it just because, but they really did. If there was an issue, they would hold you after class and ask what\'s going on and see if there was any way they could resolve the issue. They also knew when someone was getting bullied in school or at home, when the student wouldn\'t physically tell anyone, and they would act on it by helping or calling someone who could help (although there was NEVER any bullying whatsoever at 324). There was always cool events that the school like small dances to raise money for other trips so students would either have to not pay or pay a minimal price, and had and at least one field trip was happening every month. I don\'t know if they still have this program at 324, but 324 was part of this program called Project BOOST, which rewarded high achieving students with really cool field trips (I was part of this program during my 8th grade year), examples include trips to see Broadway plays, restaurants, games, movies, and even taking us to Barnes and Nobles and buying us a book! The school is all about pushing the student to reach their fullest potential. And even then, there is no such thing as complacency in the school by means of, staff members kept pushing you. MS324 takes in students with low standardized test scores and bumps them up to a high level. All the teachers show absolute commitment, which in turn inspires the student to become absolutely dedicated to school work and learning. The Principal, Ms. Heller knew everyone and is the epitome of what a school principal should be. She would take time out of her busy schedule every morning to do line-ups with every class (to check up on every class, give insightful information, to encourage students, etc.), before sending the classes upstairs to get started. During the day, she would visit classes just to see how everyone was and she even helped children herself who were stumped on a topic in whatever subject the class was in (this one time she came into our gym class when we had a substitute teacher and led exercises for us, which was pretty cool, how many people can say that their principal came in and exercised with you during gym?). If a student was upset or sad, she would take time out of her day to be that helping hand. She also was not a push over (definitely not), she is very strict, but in a good way. She would not hesitate to enact disciplinary action when necessary. She became a role model to many students, including myself. The system of having a PACT sheet everyday (a paper in which the class gets graded and rated on overall performance, such as behavior, attention, etc..) also kept the classes in line. 324 is also VERY BIG on college readiness and carrying on the message that all students must go on to college after high school, seeing as in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, there are many high school dropouts who end up not doing anything except freelance. 324 did not want us to become a ""statistic"" and wanted us to break all barriers that held Hispanics/African-Americans in the dark. The super tight knit community of 324 also helped a great deal in my development as an adolescent; because of this closeness with everyone, it truly felt like a family or a second home. I became so excited and happy to come to school everyday (except test days). This school became such a big part in my development in life and inspired me to achieve so much more, because we actually had people tell us we were champions and could do anything our heart desires, and mean it with the most sincerity. I would recommend this school to ANY and EVERY incoming student. I sure know that on the last day of school, I cried because I did not want to leave. If I had the chance to repeat my middle school years, I wouldn\'t change a thing because MS 324 is absolutely perfect and amazing in every single way.']"

Coming from experience with the school staff, they can be disrespectful (Unnecessary screaming, nasty attitude etc.) including the security which hardly do their jobs, they're more concerned with the students uniform policy instead of looking out for the students and protecting them. Also the deans at the school act like they don't want to be there and don't like working with the students. When my parents come to the school, the staff are disrespectful. Lots of the staff go by their own rules which can be confusing and you can tell they don't even follow their own rules. A lot of the teachers choose favorites and treat them better than the other students (letting them not go by rules but getting other students in trouble for doing the same). Usually, I would have to go straight to the principal for anything if I really need something cause most staff is unhelpful and do what they want. The principal is great, it's just the staff that needs fixing. There are some teachers that actually do their jobs, care about their students and want to help out but alot of the staff treat the students poorly and makes the students react offensively ending in unnecessary punishments. There's alot of unnecessary punishments like being a minute late ends up to be an hour detention after school, the school believes that punishments fix us and helps us but it's extremely unaffective. Lots of the unnecessary punishments ends up with students missing class time which is the point of going to school in the first place and should be a priority.

06M368,"['My son is a 5th grader and has been at HHS since 1st grade. It has been a wonderful experience for him.  Classes are small and the teachers are excellent.  While there has been problems with administration in the past, the teachers and families at the school have maintained the the special spirit of the school. We now have a strong, proactive principal in Charles Reilly. Within just a few weeks of his first year he brought in after school programs and this year has coordinated with Boys & Girls Club of Harlem for after school coverage till 6pm.  Our teachers have always been jewels of the school as they have created safe, stimulating classrooms where our kids thrive.  For example, when my son struggled in 4th grade with math early in the year, it was quickly clear that there were social/emotional issues contributing to his struggle and his teacher skillfully came up with plans to address both sides of the struggle. When the social/emotional issues started manifesting outside of school, his teacher and Mr. Reilly were incredibly supportive and made sure my son had the support he needed.  Within just a couple months my son was again thriving socially and emotionally and had raised is math average by 10 points!  This year Mr. Reilly has the two 5th grade classes sharing teachers -- one is teaching math and science, the other ELA and Social Studies -- so the kids switch classrooms, getting a taste of what is to come in middle school. The teachers are excited because they aren\'t as ""overwhelmed"" and can dedicate more time and energy developing lessons that are engaging and meet the needs of learners of all levels.  I am so grateful to have found this gem of a school and confident my son will thrive in middle school thanks to the strong, creative education he is receiving here.', ""A word of caution about this school.  I had a child just graduate from HHS this year.  It was a great school for her and most of the teachers are amazing.  My son, who has special needs, was a first grader last year. HHS was a nightmare for him last year.  I had been expressing concern to the new principal, Charles Reilly, since 12/18 regarding the special education teacher in his class.  Other parents witnessed her making my son sit out of recess for questionable reasons.  He has ADHD and needs to be able to exercise!  My daughter reported observing the same thing. Mr. Reilly continually pushed it off and didn't do anything about my concerns, he even told me I had something personal against the teacher. My son started having nightmares and was acting differently at home. I continually tried to discuss with the teachers and the principal, and was told my son was happy in school. In April, another mom received a call from a staff person in the school to tell her that my son and 3 other kids were being targeted by the SE teacher, the same one I had been complaining about for 5 months. This mom went to Mr. Reilly, who stated that no one had complained about this teacher before and that there was nothing to be concerned about.  5 other parents had already complained! Our children developed anxiety because the Special Education teacher started taking away free time from students for spelling a word wrong or getting a math question wrong. These are first graders!\nMy only regret is not putting a camera on my son to get proof of the abuse that was happening. The teacher was screaming, humiliating, and pulling on my son's arm forcefully. This is not a school for children with special needs.  I have continually had problems with his services and most of the teachers are not equipped to work with kids with special needs.  HHS has a practice of having kids share paras to save money and don't want to give services because their budget is very small. They will insist that they can serve your child, but I assure you they cannot. Once you are in the school, it is hard to get out or transfer elsewhere, which I learned the hard way. My son was spending hours of his day wandering the halls and I didn't know this until the end of the year, when I had him evaluated for another program which sent a team into observe him. My son now hates school and it's going to take a while for him to ease back in to a new one. I had to constantly explain his disability to professionals who are supposed to be familiar with children's disabilities and the challenges they present. \n\nI cannot, with good conscience, recommend this school.  The way the situation with my son was handled was terrible.  I know that you think this could never happen to your kid, I didn't either, but it did and I will forever regret not getting recorded proof so that I can prevent this happening to someone else's child.

Her teacher is absolutely wonderful. I also love the racial, social and international diversity of the school, and the way that the school really fosters a climate of camaraderie among its students, teachers, staff and parents. Our “Sing-Along” sessions on Friday mornings are fun and deeply moving: all the students get together with parents and teachers in the cafeteria and sing in unison. We are also very happy with HHS’s afternoon program, where our children learn gymnastics, do art, and where the older ones can sign up to learn Chinese.

Clearly they don't want engaged working parents to attend, nor do they even try to have a second session in the evening. Other meetings they have are parent cook sessions at 8:45am.....um how about parent student behavior workshops, not a damn cooking class? Majority of the children are very disruptive to the point where the teachers aren't teaching but trying to get the classroom under control. Bright students fall behind because teachers have to focus on those yelling all the time. Nothing is electronic, you can not check on your child's behavior or grades online, and there are no computers. There are no field trips. The school's disciplinary action is a joke. I witnessed a mother upset that her son was bullied and confronted what appeared to be a teacher or aid. The teachers response was that because they didn't see it there was nothing they can do and they need to find the adult that did witness it. He didn't even try to console her or direct her to someone who can actually help her. It was ridiculous! This school would be much better if parents got more involved, children were better behaved and less disruptive, they implemented clubs and activities, improved communication and opportunities to parents, and help students focus through renovations."", 'PS 43 now offers pre-k for both 3- and 4-year olds', 'P.s 43 is a good school trust me i was their for 3 years and im proud of  it and their acomplishments thats why its an A school 5 years IN A ROW', 'i agree too much', 'Not true they are safe respectful and responsible im a witness']"
