I also met personally with every teacher and both the AP and Principal all three years. Further, I saw that the school needed support with the students and I volunteered to help out.  I realize that not every parent has a schedule that allows them to go to meetings but surely more parents could have been there than were.  \n\nWest Prep\'s motto is ""With the Work of All"".

SMSHS has, at least for this family, been an absolutely wonderful educational experience, one of the very best we've experienced in NYC public schools. The academic program is, in some ways, even better than the music program. Classes are small, teachers are smart and engaged, the curriculum (especially given the necessary Common Core and Regents elements) is better than any other HS we've experienced, the kids are focused, and the standards are very high. Take a look at the work by kids hanging up in the classrooms when you visit. You don't see fluent essays, long reports in Spanish, articulate fiction, and so on in your average HS; the work holds its own or exceeds academic work done in the traditional specialized NYC high schools. The kids are, without exception, accomplished musicians and most of them apply the learning skills they have developed through their music training to their academic work. As with music, kids are expected to practice until they show mastery of a academic subject and then they move on to the next topic. Kids who excel at, say, math or a language, speed through the required work and move on to the next level, they are not held back. Classes are small enough to make this work. And the music education is superb, the best in the city by our (no doubt biased) estimation . . . the school is essentially a small college-level conservatory. Most of the kids pass the AP music test in _9th_ grade and then move on to more complex music theory and practice. Many of the kids play at a near-professional level and they all take their music very seriously. Perhaps half the school day is spent on music and the classes _start_ at basically a college level and move on from there. The school is tiny and yet the orchestra (which is sometimes fleshed out by kids just starting a second or third instrument) performs at a respectable college level. Many of the kids are so self-motivated that parents and teachers sometimes, wisely, encourage them to do a little _less_ work every day, to take time off to be a kid, to socialize, and so on. It's a wonderfully supportive atmosphere, top to bottom, and while not every kid is going to go on to a career in music, every kid seems to find a comfortable musical niche at SMS.\n\nThere are, yes, the usual HS issues at SMS . . . kids will be kids, some are more mature than others, some, maybe most, are still finding their place in the world and sometimes being a kid is painful but . . . things that are problems at many high schools, social cliques, fighting, discipline, apathy, and so on are rare at SMS. Compared to, say, LaGuardia or Stuyvesant, SMS is a low-drama place. Complications at the school are more along the lines of kids working _too hard_, having too many outside music commitments, aesthetic disputes, or career concerns. However, it's a tight-knit group and kids and parents who have concerns will find thoughtful, sympathetic, help. Perhaps the largest issue at the school is the physical space, being underground is a drag (the whole school is in a basement with no windows). Also, the large school complex that houses the school serves several other schools and, sadly, kids/teachers/visitors have to go through metal detectors and security lines. \n\nIf you are looking for a school for a kid who takes their music _and_ their academic work seriously, SMS HS is worth a close look. It's not for everyone, kids who don't already get up before school to practice (or read) might not get it. Kids who want a school with a diffuse arts program might want to go elsewhere. Kids looking for a big high school with traditional programs will not like it. However, for kids who think string quartet practice, followed by reading Harry Potter out loud in Spanish, followed by a critique of a duet written by a fellow student, then a private piano lesson, and then on to math class . . . is _fun_, then SMS is perfect."", 'I appreciate your thorough review as well!

What was your child's experience?"", ""Now that my son is a sophomore, I can say with an absolute certainty that this school has been an absolute blessing for us. The small class size is the best thing for learning environment, more attention for each student, less distraction. The school is small and feels like a big family. Everyone knows everyone. All teachers are super involved in all of their students' development and academic growth. To each it's own. My daughter went to La Guardia and flourished, my son is doing phenomenally well at SMSHS.  I heard stories of kids who hated La Guardia and left midterm to their mediocre zoned schools and those who transferred in and out of SMS midterm as well. So, each child is different and each school offers different benefits. What is important is a perfect fit and it is parent's responsibility to understand his or her child's strength and weaknesses and the school' opportunities.

I just read through my comments above and a year later that all holds true, at least for us. SMS is not for every kid, not even for every music-focused kid, but for kids who take all of their studies seriously and want to work on music for half of their school day and be surrounded by musicians, it's heaven. I wish the school wasn't in a basement. I wish the music program was more willing to take chances and/or focus a bit more on music by living composers. (And sometimes I wish the kids had a larger role in presenting the school to outsiders because in my experience, the kids at SMS are very articulate about why they are happy there.) But, overall, it's a wonderful, caring school that respects its students and faculty and expects the best from both. If you visit, look around, ask plenty of questions, and you like what you hear and see, you can't go wrong. The school is, at least in my opinion, very honest in its presentation, if anything they undersell themselves a bit. \n\nHere's a remarkable profile of a current SMS student and celloist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrGGzDXYTI\n\nThere are better and worse musicians and students at SMS high school but nearly all of the kids seem driven not only to become good musicians but to become thoughtful and engaged citizens. No kid at SMS is average but this profile is average for the school. The details of SMS HS aren't discussed in this video and it's more a portrait of a young celloist than a profile of the school but I'd say this makes as strong of a case for SMS HS as any of the official Kaufman Center videos. (I'm not 100% sure about this but I _think_ that video was made by one of the young man's fellow students. The filmmaker's bio says that he's a 17 year old HS student studying composition at a public HS in NYC . . . and I can only think of one school where that is possible.)"", ""The K admission for the school is very shady. They didn't even mention that the school have only 15 seats out of 400 applicants and what kinds of tests on the school website. My child had the assessment, but we didn't even know if she got in the second round or not. The school doesn't let parents know the result or reply to email about any questions. I suspect that the children that are accepted here must be only staff's children or inner circle. As you can see, there are no comments from current parents who have child in the school when someone asked questions in this section. No transparency here!"", ""I don't know about 3 years ago, but this bhb is not true today. I'm not in any inner circle, I hadn't even attended an orientation, and yet, my daughter was accepted into kindergarten. They look for musical talent and inclination."", 'Hi Chaunice! Congratulations! My child was also accepted for 2019. I’d love to connect. Please email me or send me your email address. Thanks! Jill', ""Sorry but you are wrong. The children accepted are the most potentially talented and also have the best concentration/focus. That's because the music curriculum is demanding, and if it's not right for your child, neither he/she or you will be happy. I can't speak to your particular audition, etc. but my son got in and we had zero influence with anyone, were not musicians, etc. He was just a potentially talented musician. He's now in college, studying music, playing piano, composing. I would never say that Admissions always gets it right, but based on the other kids in my son's class, they really understand who will work best in the school and choose those children."", 'My child was admitted without my family knowing a single person at the school.\n\nI agree that the school lacks transparency about the admissions testing. That is on purpose--if parents knew exactly what was on the test, they would engage in expensive test-prep to give their kids an advantage. NYC parents do this kind of thing all the time.\n\nThat said, if you want to give your pre-K child an advantage, enroll him or her in a Dalcroze class in the Lucy Moses School (same building as Special Music School). These are music and movement classes that I suspect are quite similar to the kinds of activities the kids do during their admissions tests. My child had Dalcroze classes and played an instrument for a year before the admissions test. It also doesn\'t hurt that my child grew up in a musical environment. My sister is a professional musician, and my spouse and I are serious amateur musicians.\n\nA bigger problem, I think, is that the tests give older kids an advantage at the expense of the younger kids. There is a huge developmental difference between a child who has just turned 4 and one who is 4 3/4. I have noticed that almost all the children in my child\'s class have birthdays in January and February! This is not a coincidence (see Malcolm Gladwell\'s book ""Outliers"" for a fuller explanation of this phenomenon). In my opinion, the school should stagger their testing so that all of the students are almost exactly the same age when they are tested for musical aptitude.', '', ""Hello Mariela, congratulations!

03M862,"[""My daughter graduated from Mott Hall 2 this past June.  From 6th grade to 8th grade her time there was spent working hard, expanding her horizons, making new friends and having fun. I was amazed by their ability to take children of different races, ethnic backgrounds and academic levels and make this into one school family.  Parents and Staff work together for the betterment of all the children.  All the recent talk of integrating District 3 did not bother our school since Mott Hall 2 has been doing exactly what was proposed and doing it well from the schools inception.  I'm happy that they were given the opportunity to expand their space onto the 5th floor of the school. The additional space will help Mott Hall 2 to become even better.  I would advise all parents who children are currently in seventh grade to prepare them early for the high school process. Start looking at the NYC High School directory which can be found online, during the summer months and narrow down your child's choices. Go to each schools website and take note of all their instructions regarding admission. Many schools require that documents be dropped/mailed to them directly by the parents not the Guidance Counselor. If your child is interested in attending a Specialized H.S. get them tutoring the summer before they start 8th grade.  Keep track of deadlines, schedule tours and be realistic.  My daughter got into Beacon H.S.  Mott Hall's 2 Guidance Counselor is fantastic. My daughter's classmates got into various schools such as Beacon, Manhattan Hunter Science, Stuyvesant the list of fantastic schools is extensive.   A word of caution, only list high schools on the high school application that your child would be happy to go to no matter what.  I have heard horror stories from parents at other middle schools who put down a school their child did not really want to go to but ended up getting placed there by the DOE.  Wishing everyone the best!"", 'Now that my child is in college, I look back at her academic development and we are so grateful she attended MH2. This is the school that shaped her as a diligent and conscientious student. You taught her how to learn, manage her time, and advocate for herself. She truly grew into a scholar at Mott Hall II.

My child told me afterwards that everything on the test had been taught by Mott Hall 2.  Mr. Lowe is a wonderful Principal with a fantastic staff. I\'m constantly amazed at how organized and efficient the school is. The staff at Mott Hall 2 think out of the box. The school is proactive in regards to preparing the kids for their future. They have already started sending out e-mails and attachments regarding the high school process. I went through this with my oldest child but you forget after some years have passed. Mott Hall 2 offers a ton of clubs/school activities for your child to participate in. The PTA and the parents are very involved. We do what must be done to help our children and school.  \n\nMy advice to parents going through the Middle School process. Check the NYS scores, Tour the school and keep in mind that while scores and accolades of a school is good. The bottom line is what is best for your child.

04M012,"[""As a person who works in education, I wish I could write a positive review of TAG but my child and many other students and parents, unfortunately, did not have a good experience at this school.  The previous bad reviews of TAG by students and parents are not surprising. \n\nAfter seeing all of the good teachers leaving and the bad ones staying it was time for my child to leave. Because of this teacher exodus TAG has become a mediocre school at best. The education is very meat and potatoes with no out of the box teaching or inspiring curriculum. This is due to the lack of leadership and the very amateur principal Cesar who sees the bright students as her personal meal ticket. The school only wants to teach the students about The State tests. If you want your child to just practice for tests and not interested in learning other things then this school is for you. \n \nTAG lacks any emotional support for their overstressed students.  Year after year the majority of students feel depressed and look for help but the school “therapists” are lacking the skills to do anything. It was always hard to see students lined up outside their office knowing the lack of support they would receive. The principal hides in her office and is extremely hard to get in contact with. To get a meeting with her is extremely hard and she never wants to be bothered by parents concerns. In all of my years in education visiting dozens of schools I have never seen a principal so inaccessible to parents, teachers and students. \n \nThe lack of extracurricular activities is astounding for a gifted and talented school. Any local grade school has better facilities and activities. The building is old and full of asbestos with dirty water. I know the building has been close to shutting down because for years there has been talk of fixing these problems but the administration is not interested in doing so. TAG did not do well with the COVID 19 and received damaging assessments from the DOE about its lack of sanitary conditions. \n\nBecause TAG has students that live far away from school there is no community or school spirit. The school PTA tries to raise money and give support to the administration but it's hard when 95% of students live far from the school. \n \n Overall The school lacks leadership from principal Cesar down to the office personnel. There is no interest in inspiring students or creating a safe environment. All principal Cesar cares about is the NY State test scores, she could care less about an interesting education or the student's mental health. This school needs a major overhaul and it must start from the top."", ""Let's just start this off with TAG, which is a good school for some kids. I have seen a lot of kids leave because they couldn’t handle the workload. However, when these kids did leave, they got into good new schools such as private schools and others. TAG is a school that is different and you haven’t seen anything like it yet. It is mostly preparing you for the state testing and ultimately when you are in 8th-grade, high school level regents. TAG is a school filled with work and little play. Kindergarteners have about 10-15 minutes to play outside, on good days. There is no longer playtime when you play with building blocks and nothing really to increase a child’s creativity at a young age. Just writing and reading stuff that maybe a 2nd grader will learn in other schools. People say that school is like a prison but for my many years being here, I feel like it really is. \n\nWho am I you might ask? I am currently a 9th-grade student and I just graduated from TAG. For parents that are trying to get their child into TAG, you should be prepared. Students are expected to do 100% and to the principal, she gets control anyway she can. She acts all nice to the parents, but if you hide a voice recorder in your child's bag, you will see her true colors around students. Even some of the teachers complained, 2 years ago like 10 teachers left TAG, it was that bad.\n\nThe uniform is crazy. At one point we were told it has to be 32 degrees or lower for us to wear boots otherwise we need to wear shoes. If you ask her now, she will deny it ever happening because of the parents and students complaining. You have no sense of the expression in this school, you need to always have a tie and you will get in trouble for not having the right shoes. I know kids whose parents don’t wanna buy them shoes cause they are too expensive so they cheaper shoes. Those kids worry if they are going to get detention because of that, and I feel like that's crazy. The gym uniform is expensive, I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying it from the TAG PTA. They sell it way too overpriced for a logo that is very small compared to the size of the shirt. Students who PAY for shirts from the Debate Team and Chess team are not allowed to wear it to the gym, which is absolutely crazy. Just get red sweatpants and a white shirt and you will be fine. To make stuff worse, the principal doesn't let you wear the TAG sweatshirt that you buy from the TAG, like what is the point.\n\nWe have two vice principals, and the one students feel more comfortable around is Ms. Cosme. She is very open and relaxes, and if you have been at the TAG for long enough she might have been your 1st-grade teacher! However Mr. Dascal ( we just call him Dascal) is the opposite, he’s always mad for some reason and is never in a good mood. If he is, it is a rare occasion. We call them the 3 Deadly J’s ( their first names are Jennifer, Janette, and Johnatan). Everyone but Ms. Cosme (Jennifer) makes the school feel like a prison, and students are tired of it. We are kids with feelings and we need a voice. It has been so bad that we need a Student Council to give ideas to the principal and even the election was disorganized. \n\nNow let's talk about academics and class sizes. The class sizes at this school are WAY too big. In Kindergarten and 1st grade it is around 20 kids per class with 20 classes. But as your child gets older, more children are joining the classes and at one point there were 35 kids in a single class. Kids leave for schools like Hunter 7th grade but having that many students at one time are harder for individual learning with the teacher. Teachers are really trying to make learning fun, but with 35 students it is very hard to keep everyone focused. I have been here for about 9 years now, I know. As of now, my class has 25 students and we are lucky. \n\nThe teachers for the 8th grade are amazing, Mr. Goodin and Ms. Danticat has been here for a while and knows what they are doing. We have lost 15 good teachers, our Spanish teacher, our science teacher, and our history teacher to name a few. Our new history teacher is a teacher from the lower grades, our new Science teacher was a substitute at one point. And for about 2 weeks we have a sub in Spanish. For all of these classes, we are taking the regents and proficiency for Spanish. As a student, I am very worried. I feel like staffing should be better, but I am just a child. Teachers are really advocating for the students, more than the principal it feels like. \n\nActivities and programs for TAG are seriously lacking, the middle school programs are getting cut more and more and that is because not everyone can afford $1,250 per child to donate. The only club that middle school has is the YMCA ( not a part of TAG its YMCA program), Debate, Latin Jazz ( if you get in) and chess(which you pay the PTA for and the middle school sees none of the money back). Elementary students get way more stuff. The middle school has half-broken computers while they get BRAND NEW IMACS. Like how is this fair? Art class you cannot really express yourself, your art needs to be in a strict set of guidelines and you cannot do something related to the topic. The art teacher never finds the beauty in your artwork and always finds something wrong with it. Gym class is entertaining and Mr. Wong is really trying to stay with the guidelines and also make it fun. Mr. Faulkner is a really good music teacher and he makes class fun. \n\nAfter reading this about TAG you might wonder, why should I send my child to TAG? It all depends on how you think your child will perform if your child could keep up with the workload and will be fine with all the things I have said above, TAG is for you. TAG has been changing and this TAG in the point-of-view of a student that has been here for a while and has witnessed the good and the bad. If your child cannot do good with the reasons listed above you should research some other schools.  I know this is long, but I believe this could help a lot of parents. Thank you for reading this and I hope your child finds a school that is right for them."", 'i forgot to include that when i was a 8th grader, there was NO spanish teacher', 'Hi I\'m currently going into 7th grade and I have been at TAG for 7 years now. It has been nothing but awful. The kids are mean, one of my teachers is verbally abusive and would make kids cry everyday, and the principle is threatening and rude. There are some clubs for 7th and 8th grade but nothing else really. I guess you learn some stuff but it is under a high pressure environment which stressed out every person i knew went to TAG. Most teachers would constantly tell us we would never succeed in life. One teacher specifically said,""Okay, you can not do my homework but when I see you living in a cardboard box I\'ll wack you with my cane and tell you I told you so."" I\'m not making that up. It was probably the worst decision of my life to go there. It ruined my childhood.Thank the Gods I\'m moving schools this year.

My daughter graduated TAG in 2016. She was offered several admissions into LREI, Trinity, Brooklyn Tech and Bard. This is normal with TAG graduates! I also have a son, currently in 8th Grade. All the teachers who taught my children are very dedicated. Many time they assisted them when they are behind in their studies. My daughter credited her current excellent results in Chemistry and Biology to Mr. Roberts, her former Science teacher at TAG.   Right now, Mr. Haitram, 6th grade Maths teacher, is volunteering many hours on Saturdays to bring up to par, students in his class who are weak, among them is my son.\nI am so, so, lucky to have my children in TAG. Very appreciative of the excellent work of the Principal, Mrs. Cesar. For students complaining, it’s just normal as children. But to achieve good academic success and a role model in the larger society, rules must be observed and obeyed, otherwise there are consequences.', ""I am a current 7th grade student here. My sister went here last year.  This school has amazing teachers and she is now at a great specialized high school because of their support. The middle school teachers are the best. All of the teachers are nice but strict because they want us to do our best.  My favorite subjects are science and english. Because of the wonderful science teacher, my sister got a 100 on the high school regents test last year. We do a lot of fun things like dissections and debates  than we ever have had here at tag in elementary school. Also she got a 90 on the ELA test because of the wonderful english teacher! We do a lot of creative projects and read good books. I hope to follow in my sisters footsteps.\n\nI wish we had a better playground but other than that I love TAG. Ms. Cesar is strict but very nice if u talk to her one on one. She doesnt tolerate nonsense from any of the students and thats probably why they don't like her.  \n\nSome of hte 8th graders can be mean, like a handful,  but thankfully they are graduating soon."", 'Tag may be diverse but that literally has nothing to do with everything that goes on. Its a bad school.  I used to go here.', 'I agree with most comments below regarding TAG being focused on academics and discipline. Children are required to give their 100% in a gifted school. I always recommend to friends who are interested in the school that if you think your child cannot sit through a class, tag is not for them. Currently TAG has free after school (until 5:45pm) through a contract with Y as well as free summer camp for the Y students.There is PE once a week and swimming once a week (private school facility) from 1st-5th grade. Music once a week and chess once a week as part of the curriculum.\nI am so glad that my child could get in and consider myself lucky to be part of a great Parent network.Teachers are exceptional and children at TAG are super smart. Overall it is a slowly changing school as new wave of parents come in and demand more from the school.', 'I have three children at TAG.  My oldest (6th grade) has always thrived here academically and has always been on the honor roll, but has also always had trouble speaking up as she is very very shy.  Her teachers have, for the most part, been incredibly caring, understanding, and helpful with this.  Group projects in core disciplines as well as in technology (Lego Mindstorms + coding) have helped her become comfortable with working with others.  I credit TAG with preparing her enough to do well on the Hunter HS exam, particularly the essay - she got in with no additional prep.  My middle child started in K being behind his peers as he could not read and struggled to get started.  Now in 4th grade, he LOVES to read and has also consistently been on the honor roll.  He especially loves art - the art teacher exposes the children to the work of many different artists and gives them very creative projects to do.  My youngest (1st grade) is my most willful and free-spirited, so she has had the most difficult time settling down and focusing as her peers do.  TAG is a tightly-run ship with strict but effective discipline, so it has been harder on her than on my older ones.  Her teacher has been very encouraging about this.  Despite her academic and attention-span struggles, she has loved school and learned so much about American history, the physics of sound, beginning multiplication, and many more things about the world around her that keep her alert to how fascinating it is.', ""I'm a TAG parent, and I can tell you that the biggest complaint almost everybody at the school has is the principal. The teachers are really bright and dedicated and the PTA is amazing (and frankly, responsible for almost every good extra program that the school offers), but the place is disorganized with terrible communication skills.\n\nI've also seen what some of the other people on here are talking about, regarding Ms. Cesar screaming at little children. I know a parent whose child had to be talked out from under a desk bc he was so frightened of her. She told the kindergarten class they weren't allowed to use the toilet after lunch (which was at 11:30am!) AT ALL, which violates health codes. Students fear her - and we're talking about good kids here, not delinquents who need keeping in line.\n\nIf you have a child with an IEP, you will be ignored. Totally. They do not care about kids with special needs. \n\nBasically, what happens in the classroom is excellent and your kids WILL learn a lot. They will excel and do well on the state tests. The kids have fun and the other parents are nice and not uptight like in some gifted schools, but the administration is a mess and the only thing holding the place together is the fantastic PTA. A better principal could make this a world class institution. The raw ingredients are there."", 'It would get to the point where the 8th graders  would just start mocking her because we were sick of her. I honestly cannot believe she is still in charge.', ""I have been going to this school since I was in second grade and i am about to graduate next year. The school really hasn't changed much except for the loss and addition of new teachers , students , and electives.  Class sizes are 30 or more and there isn't much teacher to student one on one time which tends to effect a students learning and they'll start to struggle. They teach advanced things like 8th 9th or 10th grade lessons in sixth grade and sometimes rushes through material to get it out of the way , which doesn't leave a lot of time for grasping the material. Some students tend to struggle but there isn't really time for going back and reviewing sometimes. Strict dress code , no real freedom of expression except if you earn a dress down day or its your birthday. The principal is sometimes very harsh , she'll yell at kindergarteners which scares me and I feel really sorry for the little kids. The school barely has any money for extra or outside of school activities. Most of their money comes from fundraising which many of the kids don't really participate in , especially the middle school. Most of the money the school generally has mostly goes towards things like Rally and other educational things. There aren't really any sports programs either only basketball for boys and volly ball for girls only in the 7th and 8th grades. Also there isn't any extra educational programs for those who need it. Like Dream and SHSAT prep are only given to the super smart students , I feel it would better benefit those that need the extra support rather than the students who already have a clear path ahead of them"", 'TAG is basically like ""if you arent freakishly smart then why are you here"" it makes no sense.', 'The art teacher prepares students for the Specialized Arts High School Audition. Interested students work to develop a portfolio necessary for the audition process.', 'How many parents are pro a citywide school in The Bronx and another Citywide school in Manhattan or Brooklyn?', 'my granddaughter did not have a great experience at TAG. The problem I see is that those who have had a negative experience at TAG do not speak about the realities of their child being targeted, neglected, singled out and blasted if they do not function at a high standard.  If your child is a little behind, they are not given the extra help that is needed.  What I really did not appreciate and will vocalize it is that parents have to sign an agreement to remove their child from the school if they do not hold up to the standards of TAG\'s academics.  If a child has a disability, it is also shunned upon.  If parents do not have the time to participate in the school, their child is neglected and targeted to be removed from the school.  I questioned why, with a school so diverse, starting out as a predominately Black school, that they would not offer more support for students who do qualify for placement in TAG or any citywide school?  Anderson, NEST+M, BSI all offer great support for their students and do not push them out of the school if they have a bad year; they offer them the support they need!  If I am wrong, the please correct me but, from what I hear, no citywide g&t school except for TAG gives up on the students who are accepted in their school and tosses them away as lost causes.\n\nHer teacher made her feel horrible every day.  Let everyone in the class know that she was struggling and made her feel very bad about it. My granddaughter went from a very bright and energetic child, full of query, astute, quick to pick up and learn ANYTHING, very confident and well behaved, to a distraught, confident-broken seven year old who would rather have stayed at home than go to school, her behavior and mouth reflected this.  In the beginning of the school year the teacher told her mother that she would not pass but never offered any assistance ""I don\'t have time to help her... move her to another school.""  From the second week in September she was neglected academically.  At times she came home in tears because the teacher embarrassed her, screamed and yelled at her.  We witnessed this abuse several times.  Ms. Cesar was not very accommodating, was untouchable and unreachable.  the request to change my granddaughter\'s teacher fell on deaf ears, like dust being dropped in a turbulent sea.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, TAG is a great school if you\'re willing to be at the school often, and not afraid to lose time at work.  My daughter is a single mother and MUST work and cannot miss time at work.  when she gets off of work, she has to pick up her daughter and get back home to Brooklyn, eat, bathe and sleep to get up at 5:00 am to get her daughter to school early and to work by 8:00 in the morning.  Don\'t expect to get any resources if your child is having a bad month or year, the solution is to remind parents about the agreement that MUST be signed in order to attend TAG, to voluntarily remove your child from the school, if the child cannot keep up.  Even-though my granddaughter caught up and reached the mark to be promoted, Ms Cesar decided that she would be left back or ""leave the school"" and she will not stop the REGULAR school from placing her in the 2nd grade.  She insulted my daughter stating that my granddaughter was not gifted and her test score of 99.99 was a fluke.  Even when other evaluations such as Stanford Bine showed her scores in the top 1%.  her tutors who helps students in wealthy schools such as Dalton, evaluated her, tutors her and says, that she is performing at the level she needs to be and at the level of those $34,000 plus schools. as a first grader, she went from performing just above a kindergarten level to a third grade level in less than five months!  when shown these evaluation (no less than 3 in the academic year) Ms. Cesar is not impressed.  my granddaughter is broken and clams up whenever Ms. Cesar is around and when her teacher, Ms, Liu tests her.  \n\nFor those of you who are considering sending your child(ren) to TAG Young Scholars, be prepared to make sure your child has EVERY skill they need to keep up and not have a bad week, month or few months.  Be prepared to spend time and money in and with (for) the school.  You HAVE to be a dedicated parent and get to know EVERYONE in the school in order for your child to be given preferential treatment.  \n\nI am not sure what my daughter will do for next year.  We are already looking and applying for a transfer to another citywide G&T school.  I don\'t think it is fair and right to force my granddaughter to stay in an environment where she feels unsafe, unwelcome and literally castrated and ostracized.  Mostly,  I would like to see that old seven year old that started the school year.', ""I can relate. i've seen so many kids there looking so tired and drained, me being one of them.

Everyone.\n\nBut you should first try to arrange for a 6:30 or 7:00am sit-down meeting appointment with the principal and the teacher, before the daily demands of school. It's not too late.\n\nThere are not enough G&T spaces in New York City, so your granddaughter may have to stay where she is. She is a bright child and you and your daughter as tax payers deserve to see the girl treated as fairly as any other student.\n\nYour daughter has proven that she belongs there academically. If she ever falls behind, get her outside tutoring. There are pockets of busy and low-income families who find a way to do this, paying for tutors. You will find a way.

In fourth grade a teacher didn’t let me go on a school trip, all because my mom was out of the country and couldn’t help me with one assignment. In fifth grade a teacher wouldn’t allow me to use the bathroom during an exam unless I finished it in entirety first. Because all pre teens have perfect bladders right?

In one of my MS years I was jumped, by a few of my classmates—where two of them grabbed my hoodie and spit down the back of my neck.

I ran in tears to find the AP—and you know what he said to me? “Come back to me on Monday and I’ll see.” To this day I have a box cutter knife scar on my cheek and C-PTSD from that day. It’s small factors from my time here that led me to being diagnosed with two eating disorders, two anxiety disorders, and bipolar depression.

04M102,"[""I am a parent of a kindergarten student in the G&T program, and I chose the school in part because of the many posts on this page. We have great respect for the administration (Principal Mullan and Asst. Principal Doerr in particular), and have found them to be extremely responsive. However, we have had issues with the program itself. First of all, laptops, ipads, and the smart board are heavily relied on class. We have raised this with the kindergarten teacher, and he feels that it is an appropriate use of technology. However, we feel that it is an excessive amount of screentime, and an over reliance on gadgets to do the job of teaching. Lessons are often introduced by Brain Pop via the smart board, and children work with the iPad or laptop at center time. I realize that this is truly a matter of opinion, but for us, it's a big problem. \n\nSecond, despite the small class size, which we were hoping would be an advantage, there is little differentiated instruction or innovative curriculum. Homework comes back stamped with no comments, reading levels are only reviewed on a set schedule, and while we were told that differentiated math would start in March, it did not. They were supposed to implement the Great Books program which they have in place at TAG, but that did not take place. \n\nThird, there is little enrichment or project based learning, which are supposed to be the hallmarks of a district G&T. Chess and computer coding were introduced a couple of times at the beginning of the year, but were never followed up on. The first real project is the neighborhood unit, which is what we saw on our tour last year, and is indeed great. But that's the first project, and the year is almost over. There are art and science extras, but science is weak (kids frequently bring home coloring book pages), although the school is working on it and they supplement the science curriculum in class (they learned about the three stages of matter). Finally, it seems that there's a lot of non-educational downtime; the kids have watched movies in whole or in part during the school day (Finding Nemo, Trolls, Frozen, several Peanuts specials etc.), and while they have school trips,and some are to museums (The Whitney, NY historical society for the Mo Willems show) many of them are non-academic (a Halloween Puppet show, kids also saw stage performances of both the Wiz and the Wizard of Oz). There is also a heavy emphasis in the school on winning ClassDojo points for behavior and rewarding this behavior with toys or other items from the Treasure Chest."", 'A prospective parent writes: ""The school seemed lovely. Lots of really neat student art work around. Clean, quiet. Staff super friendly and welcoming. Kids seemed calm and relaxed. We were there on the Friday AM before the break and sat in on an all school Harambe singing and praising assembly. The leadership team seemed to be making a very concerted effort to foster respectful communication and kind treatment between kids and teachers and between kids. \n\nI went to part of the G&T open house, and then we sat in on an hour or so of the K G&T class. Julie Mullan, the principal, professed a commitment to constructivist, child-centered education for all kids and they seem to be really succeeding in putting this into practice for the G&T kids. They do project-based and in-depth learning, use a different, more hands on and project-based math curriculum, etc. When we sat in on Mr. Devine\'s K G&T class (he came from Anderson, where he was an assistant teacher for 5 years) the kids were working independently in small groups to make elaborate model neighborhoods from cardboard boxes, after having made maps of their own neighborhoods on paper. The maps and all of the work on display in the class was impressive - full sentences, all kinds of genres. He said many are reading several grades levels above their age. There are 9 kids in the class, many from out of the neighborhood, several from Mott Haven. They do 2-3 field trips/month.""', ""As a current parent, this was also my impression of the school when I visited last year, and is largely responsible for our choice of P.S. 102 However, it should be noted that they did the  neighborhood model project this year too, but it was the only project-based learning that the class engaged in all year. And the teacher did all the street signs himself, instead of engaging the kids in so doing. Also, the map making assignment referenced in the above comment was done at home with parents over spring break. They do take several field trips, but many are just for fun. \n\nIn terms of the kids reading above grade level, many of the children are indeed reading significantly above grade level, but are generally assigned in-class reading levels below their current level, and are not actively encouraged by the teacher to take home more challenging reading from the library, or explore new topics. While we received one comment on a progress report, urging us to encourage more non-fiction reading (and I agree with that need), she has never brought one non-fiction book home from school, or mentioned that she's been exposed to one during classtime--this is emblematic of the teacher's general lack of meaningful engagement with the kids."", 'There will be an open house from 5PM-6PM on April 20, 2016 at the school for our Gifted and Talented Program.

These teachers work super hard and always make sure their students push themselves to do better and better and the students are not just students their family to them.\n\nThird but not last, the office staff ladies are beyond professional, kind, loving and caring to any one who walks into that office, as the day begins at 7:30 am you will find these ladies assisting everywhere as families walk in, they assist the children during breakfast, and throughout the entire day and are capable to manage their office duties as well and have it all running smooth, no other school office can do this !!!\n\nFourth, the parent coordinator, Ms. Diane Spears is truly an amazing woman, with her duty as parent coordinator she goes beyond just like the office staff to assist families with any question or concern and she does it proudly and it shows !!!\n\nLast, the school has the best PTA staff who have brought in new ideas and work countless hours to make things happen and its all for the kids !!!\n\nWe are proud parents of such a magnificent school !!!\n\nThank you to ALL at PS 171 !!!\n\nMrs. Jamie Villanueva & Mr. Alfredo Villanueva', 'As a student being in this school from kindergarten to eighth grade it was a delightful adventure. Patrick Henry made me felt safe and I enjoyed that feeling. This school was like a second home to me and I am grateful to all the teachers and staff that have stood by me throughout my journey. Teachers were able to make class interesting, they even included valuable life lessons as well. Like always being aware of a situation, being focused, and most of all showing what\'s useful and what is needed in the future. \n  Now not only does this school makes me feel welcomed everyday, I feel as though teachers are actually interested into what I have to say. If it wasn\'t for the music teacher (the wonderful Mr. Durant) I wouldn\'t be attending my dream high school, I wouldn\'t have fully discovered my interest in music and love towards it. Along with my technology teacher (the magnificent Mr. Martino), he taught me an instrument that I never thought i would ever be able to play, he was always understanding and supportive that I\'m so grateful to him as well. I grew a great bond with the teachers and I know future students will grow the same exact bond. It hurts to leave, but it feels nice knowing that not only my family support me, but that these teachers and staff support me as well. \n  I really recommend this school, the amount of supplies given to students, ipads, books, computers, and etc. The technology made learning easier and more interesting. Also, the staff are really understanding and sweet, and they do their best as well as Mr. Pantelidis. This school gives many opportunities, and memories to cherish. Now if you\'re enrolling and was accepted to the school get ready to see your new principle welcoming you saying ""good morning"" every day with a smile.

Even though I had only gone to Patrick Henry for my middle school years, I was bale to make great friendships with my fellow students and I was able to bond with the teachers. The school may not be the biggest or most grand but there is definitely a lot of opportunities from this school.\n     Patrick Henry is a great school that manages to help it's students learn important information and teaches us valuable life lessons, like how to work with others and how to look for opportunities. Throughout my years there, I have taken part in many out of school opportunities such as taking short classes at the Mount Sinai Medical School as well as being able to take part in the SIG program (Summer Institute for the Gifted) which allows students to spend time on actual college campuses. In addition the school has a been able to create a safe community between the teachers and students which I appreciated greatly. One of the teachers who I appreciated the most was the music teacher,  Mr. Durant. He showed me that I am able to do anything that I put my mind to and boosted my confidence in my musical abilities.\n     Honestly, everything about this school was great in my opinion but there was one limitation, the size. My class alone has 35 students and we somehow managed to fit into our classrooms. Even so, with the amazing principle and Vice principles, Patrick Henry is constantly getting better and growing in technology. During my 8th grade year, student were given tablets to work on during class which is something I doubt I would have gotten at another school. \n     In the end, Patrick Henry will always have a place in my heart and I highly suggest this school for any other kid who is even slightly interested."", ""I am am a high school freshman who graduated from this school in 2016.

I feel that i have grown academically and as a person,just like anyone else. and because of patrick henry, i am the student i am today,a student who wants and hopes to strive for success and a  great future.\n\nHonestly everything i have to say about this school is positive, this school has taught me everything i know , but hasn't shown any bad decisions and influences. whats wonderful about this school, is that the teachers understand you, they help you in any way they can, and the best part is, that there way of teaching, involves fun, learning and communication.\n\nLastly, patrick henry has a lot of very good and wonderful teachers, but i may say that Mr.Durant was the best out of all of them. he Ramirez give up on me at all, and most importantly he gave me a many great memories to remember. he helped get out of my shy bubble. he knew that i was a shy girl that would barely talk to people, but look at it now, i could sing with my friends and even sing in public, but if it weren't for my music teacher, i would still be in my shy bubble and i would have a harder time in high school honesty.\n\nI Leslie Ramirez believe that many students who are planning or are in this school, should be 100 percent glad to  say that they are in or applying for this school, never doubt that you do any good in this school, because it is the exact opposite, patrick henry ps 171 is the best Ramirez been to and the best i have ever encountered, the best i know.

The technology that we were able to use was great, and I know I wouldn't find that at other schools. The music program, led by Mr. Durant, was fantastic, and I have nothing negative to say about that. I grew not only as a student, but as a person. I became more confident in who I am and I can say that the strong academic program made all the graduating students capable of having a successful future. \n\nI don't have much to say about this school that is negative, and I know that I have been well prepared for whatever high school has to throw at me. The thing I love about the teachers is that not only do they provide a great learning experience in their subject, but they also take time to talk about the future and what kinds of things to expect. The teachers were down to Earth and sometimes talked about their own experiences in life prior to becoming teachers at 171. It was quite interesting to see their perspectives on everything. It was such a diverse group of teachers, too, so you'd always get a different story from a different person. \n\nI'd have to say my favorite memories will be my time in music class with Mr. Durant. I feel like I had a close teacher to student relationship with him most out of all the teachers I had during my time at 171. He especially helped me grow and come out of my shell to become not only a stronger vocalist, but a stronger human being. And for that I will be eternally grateful.\n\nThis school is definitely the place to be for middle school. I haven't had experience as an elementary school student there, but I'm sure that incoming students will have a great time learning at P.S. 171."", 'I am a former parent of two children who went to PS. 171, and unfortunately, we moved and thus also had to move to a different school, but can only say good things about 171, the staff and the administration. The children who go to this school are provided with so many resources due to the many grants and partnerships that Mr. Pantelidis (the principal) and his team are able to acquire for the school. This allows many inner city children, who might otherwise not be able to afford such programs, to be exposed to and avail of the various opportunities that they deserve. The school also ascertains that the children receive an excellent academic education, and their consistent above average test scores prove that. The teachers are enthusiastic and very caring, and many have been there for a long time, and seem to take real pride in their work and the children they teach. I also found Mr. Pantelidis to be very open to suggestions/concerns I had which I very much appreciated as it made me feel like the teachers and the parents could work together well as a team to ensure the very best for the children.\n\nPatrick Henry Prep also has a wonderful music program and teacher in Mr. Durant, who goes above and beyond in his mission to teach children to love and practice music. His enthusiasm and approachable attitude was such a delight and inspiration to the kids. We also had the opportunity to be a part of their Opus 118 violin program, which my daughter greatly benefited from. All in all, we had a really good experience and wish Mr. Pantelidis, and all the teachers and staff the very best in their joint vision of success for this school.

The teachers challenge the students, yet they don't go too fast so we can understand everything being taught. They provide us with all the resources that they need, including Ipads, laptops, and computer and science labs for both lower and upper school. The school makes sure that every kid has access to the things we need to help us succeed.\n\nNot only are the academics amazing, but the music program is excellent, and it is all thanks to the brilliant music teacher, Mr. Durant. As an aspiring singer, he has without a doubt improved my skills and brought me out of my shell. All throughout my middle school years, I have been participating in school concerts and participating in various music events.

My daughter has been attending this school for seven plus years. I must say that it has been a great experience for her. She loves her school. This speaks volume. \n\nThe academics are extremely rigorous and prepares students for high school and college. Technology is infused across the curriculum. The students have access to up to date and fully functional science and computer labs, laptop carts and there is a smart board in every class. There is a multitude of online resources for both parents and students.\n\nAs a parent of an aspiring vocalist, it would be remiss of me not to mention 171's music program. I have observed the growth of the music program throughout the years. This growth is evident in my daughter. She has developed her musical talent under the leadership of Mr. Durant and has been given the opportunity to participate in programs such as Solo Ensemble, NYSSMA, MS Arts Audition Boot Camp and Carnegie Hall Count Me In Program. It should be noted that 171 alumni currently attend some of the best academically advanced and arts high school in New York City.\n\nI am grateful for the vision of Mr. Pantelidis who goes above and beyond to ensure that all of his students have access to a wide variety of  both in school and after school activities. Personally, my daughter has benefitted from OPUS 118 (violin), Horticultural Society, Chess in Schools, America Scores (soccer and poetry), Urban Advantage (science), Studio in School (visual arts) and  Harlem RBI(softball / baseball).

I am a parent of 4. 3 of my children have already graduated from PS 171 in East Harlem. The remaining ?is in the 7th grade now. Ever since Mr. Pantelidis has taken over the school as principal,  he just continues to get better. He and his staff do not stop. They continue to push for more funding and grants allowing all of the students more opportunity and a great education. They have up to date computer labs for all grades. The City testing rates are excellent. They do not leave any child behind. They have an excellent music teacher who helps the children not only during their time in 171 but continues through high school enrollments and encourages them to follow their dreams. He shows them many different aspects of the music program not just in a book but takes them to events so that they may have the chance to experience the music hands on. Mr Durante has played such an important role with my daughter continuing to pursue her music interest in singing. He helped get her ready for her high school audition in so many ways. When she was in the 7th grade he gave her information for a summer music program that only few kids were chosen for after auditions. He helped prepare her and she was accepted into this program 3 years in a row. This also helped prepare her for high school. Now in the 10th grade she knows things that other kids don't because he taught the children these things in elementary school giving them the  knowledge that they didn't even expect they would need to know later and how important it would be."", 'I am a former 171 student and all I have to say is that it has been the greatest experience of my life. It has always been such a lovely environment to be in. The classes are tough, yes, but it is all to prepare you for what is coming in high school. What I enjoy most about 171 as a student who wants a career in music is that music classes are given one or two times a week depending on what grade your child might be. To further extend that, they also provide an awesome after school program called GOAL chorus that I attended in my two years of being in the school. If you are a parent or a student looking to enroll in a middle school, I 100% encourage you to go to 171 for an amazing future ahead of you. There is something for every student to enjoy.&nbsp; Every teacher cares about their students. The principal is always there for you when needed.

This school has opened a lot of doors for me. Mr. Pantelidis and the other staff are very diligent and care very much about the students. The school prioritizes the safety and education of the students and cares very much about what parents have to say. Because of this school, I am taking sophomore and junior classes even though I am a freshmen. However, this not the only amazing thing about the school. This school's music instructor, Mr. Durant is an outstanding teacher. His lessons are immersive and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this school."", "" I am a sophomore in highschool and out of all the years of school I've had so far, P.S 171 has given me the best. Mr. Pantelidis ensures that the education of students comes first. Teachers and staff make sure that there is a open and safe learning place for students. Teachers also make sure that students are given all of the tools necessary for continuing on into highschool. One thing that I admired most about Patrick Henry Prep was it's appreciation of the arts. The musical instructor, Mr. Durant, is just about as good as it gets. It wasn't until I met him that I pursued my aspirations of becoming a vocalist. Never, in a million years, would I have thought that I would be going to the #1 performing arts highschool in america. And that's all thanks to the musical instructions provided by him. \n\n There is another part of 171 that I absolutely loved, and that was the afterschool program, GOAL. It opened so many windows of opportunity for me, providing homework help and a spot in a choir! Also, GOAL was the reason I went to Washington, D.C. , and Boston, Massachusetts . (Those trips were SUPER fun.)\n\n All in all, although my time at 171 is over, I go to visit sometimes and it still feels like home. I highly recommend this school. Its one of the best. "", ""As a sophomore student in high school, I can honestly say 171 was a great experience for me, along with classmates whom I still am friends with today. There is an open space to which all students, no matter their background, language, or etc., are encouraged to participate in. A strong department is quickly improving--music. Mr. Durant specializes in vocal music and guides each grade to becoming better musicians, and better people, too. Though the school has always, from what I have known through grades K-8, focused on having a music class, Mr.Durant has really brought the school and its students out to earn a name for themselves outside of the vigorous core class. The music program is brought even further out with GOAL, a significant part of the school that happens after classes, where students can work with other grades and ages to create and experience music. Additionally, the education system is very intense, which drives students to do their best and exceed expectations in order to satisfy themselves with knowledge and success. Along with all of that, the teachers work collaboratively to cater to the students' needs and make sure that all requirements, held up by themselves and by their bosses, are met. The school has shaped me to be the person I am today, and continues to do so with its open doors and expanding connections.

The principal Mr. Pantelidis is an excellent principal but he is also more interested in his status in the NYC DOE than in the emotional well being of students with special needs.

04M182,"['This school was my home.  I graduated in the year of 2010, and had the best teachers there. However, a lot of them have left due to the horrible service and organization of the principal. She is very unprofessional and quite able to assume things right away, whatsoever. A cousin of mine who graduated two years ago told me that she was mean and was never able to at least say hi to the parents or to the kids on the first day of school. Who even hired this principle? She is not doing a good job. Many parents would tell me when I would pick up my cousin, that she is not well-prepared to even be in the school and is very rude. I just feel like she needs to be more professional at her job and stop being obnoxious to others, such as teachers. Many of my old teachers have left because of her, however they were such great teachers! She has made my childhood school in such a bad place and has made the school look bad.

The teachers try to teach all the time. They also try to help the best that they can. Although, many students here aren't really cooperative or eager to learn. An amount of students are highly distracting during class which results in many other children not being able to fully focus on their class work or to learn. Most kids will violate school rules such as cussing, cell phone use, talking back to the teachers. It's not the teachers who are bad because they try. It is the students. They do not fully respect the adults as they should. When students are loud and rowdy they usually only calm down when a higher faculty member is in the classroom or if the teacher breaks to the point whereas they have to phone the office. Many students become stressed because of such distraction. There needs to be a way where the distractive kids will pipe down. Those individuals are being down the other children's futures. Perhaps all the kids who don't care much could be placed in a class together, those who want to learn will learn and those who don't care will have to live with the fact that they didn't take the oppurtunity to learn when they had it.""]"

The teachers were always very understanding and communicated with me.  She is now in the 7th grade and has found her stride.  I have to give a special and much deserved mention to the math teacher Ms. Barnes.  Her way of teaching some may consider as tough but I believe it is the perfect balance of stern teaching and heartfelt care for the students.  She has proven to be a teacher who truly cares about the kids and how prepared they are for the state tests.  When your kid speaks highly of a math teacher you better take notice because that does not happen often.

Thanks ME and NYC public schools!', 'I have 2 sons in Manhattan East ""ME,“ in the 8th and 6th grades. Like most families, my children are quite different and they both enjoy ME for different reasons. My 8th grader was just accepted to LaGuardia. His school experience, teachers, curriculum, and administrative staff all played a critical role to help him reach this goal. The academics are rigorous enough to challenge and prepare students for high school, and there is enough support and there are sufficient options for students to strive for the highly competitive specialized schools. The Arts education is exceptional. I must highlight Mr. Cusack, the music teacher. My son studied saxophone for the first time at ME, and he spent extra time joining the ME Jazz Band and also joining the Manhattan-wide Concert Band in 6th grade. Mr. Cusack makes sure all of the students have access to these opportunities. I must also commend all of the teachers at ME. They really support and push the students according to their ability, and they are very honest about their assessments during Parent Teacher conferences or by email. I also want to point out the great organization and responsiveness of the administrative staff. The school changed principals year before last and there was no drama and the school systems went along as usual. I had experience with changing principals as a very active parent in my children’s elementary school and the calm process at ME was miraculous. I have not been as an active a parent at ME, but I do commend the Parent Leadership and their work. I also appreciate that all of the students really have the opportunity to develop their own personalities and personal styles. The students are expressive and confident in what they do. My other son is not as academically focused his older brother, but he is working very hard (and we, his parents are too) at making sure he gets the support he needs. Yet, my second son enjoys ME just as much albeit in different ways. He is much more social (which is part of the challenge) and into sports and dance. All of the students must take an instrument and it is refreshing that they all learn and develop an appreciation for music, visual arts, and dance. ME has been and continues to be a journey (location and fifth floor walk up not withstanding) and a very worthwhile educational experience.', 'I am agree wholeheartedly!', 'My daughter began attending Manhattan East in Sept. 2016, and I am so grateful. Classes are small, teachers and administration are attentive and respectful, the academics are rigorous, the arts offerings are excellent, and the student body is diverse and close-knit. The staff at Manhattan East is stable, with little turnover from year to year, probably because they seem to genuinely love teaching children at this age, and because the principal speaks of the staff and students with great respect. Mr. Genao and Ms. Cancel are extremely responsive to parent concerns, and the students themselves say that bullying is not tolerated at Manhattan East. After a difficult social environment during her last two elementary school years, my child has been warmly welcomed and accepted just as she is at Manhattan East. She is excelling academically and is happy and thriving at Manhattan East.', 'So glad to hear that Ms. Sarro retired as principal. ', 'I am currently a seventh grader and I attend this school. I know they say not to point out specifics but this is positive so maybe make an exception. I would like to personally thank Ms. Barnes (6&7th grade math teacher) and Mr. Duffy (6&7th grade English teacher) and Mr. Handibode (6&7th grade History teacher) for being exceptional teachers that allow all of us to blossom and learn more about the world and about how to solve expressions and equations using variables and fractions and how to pick out different themes from songs, books, poems and more! They are three of the best teachers I have ever had including the other teachers who are not bad just not the ones that came to mind when I thought ""who are the best teachers at the school?"" Hopefully we can change a few things though. Such as some of the many musical instruments we have are getting rusty and they are falling apart such as the trumpets. They fall apart while you ae playing them and all the good ones someone took home with them and basically never gave them back. Another thing that needs to be taken care of quick is the bathroom situation. The girls bathroom has writing on the wall saying some means things such as ""so and so is a freak"" (which happened to my friend). They also need some air freshener or something because it STINKS in there!! Other than those small mishaps, I would highly recommend this school to all you fifth graders or fifth grade parents looking for a good school for their children. Here the students and teachers  feel like family and at the same time your children will blossom and learn more and will get community service hours, elective, football club, musical instruments, talent shows, dances, party\'s, extra credit events, school lunches, a site to keep track of your work progress, wonderful teachers and staff members, friends, and most of all a wonderful community of people who want to learn and teachers who are going to do that for you.', 'My son had a wonderful middle school experience at Manhattan East.  I\'ve sung its praises to many local parents trying to make middle school decisions.  I always say, first, that I underestimated how valuable I\'d find having ONLY middle-schoolers around my kid.  The staff and faculty have a deep understanding of that age, and they keep them sheltered enough to let them be playful kids while encouraging responsibility and independence.  \nSecond, I tell parents that the school is full of interesting, creative kids.  The administration makes of point of celebrating individuality among both students and teachers (that\'s one reason the kids don\'t wear uniforms).  Because all kids are appreciated for themselves, there\'s little cliquishness and social jockeying for popularity.  My son had positive relationships with most kids, and when he ran into personality conflicts, teachers and administrators were keyed into them and gently helped the kids work through their differences.  \nWhen I talk to deciding parents, I also make sure to describe the challenging and stimulating work the ME teachers have students do. The ELA curriculum reads like a syllabus for a college literature seminar, complete with group discussions about complex topics related to the books they\'re reading, such as The Outsiders, Of Mice and Men, The Giver, 1984, and many, many more.  Science, social studies and especially the 8th grade math teachers all gave my son freedom to work beyond what was being done in the classroom when he was in need of more challenge.  They were well-prepared for whatever standardized tests came their way, but what\'s much better, they led their classrooms with much more interesting and challenging goals in mind.  They also offered a wide variety of electives, including some unusual ones like cartooning and African dance.  And they welcomed the kids to hang out in their classrooms at lunch. One teacher ran a Dungeons and Dragons club during lunch that became the highlight of my son\'s 8th grade year.  Plus the value of my son learning an instrument cannot be underestimated.  He capped off his experience with an exciting trip to the Jazz Band competition at Six Flags.  It\'s particularly telling that Manhattan East won for ""Esprit de Corps,"" an award given to the school with the most engaged, excited, and cooperative student performers.  The respect and pride the students have for their teacher, their music, and their school must have shown bright and clear to the judges.\nLastly, I want to give a shout out to the principal and assistant principal, both of whom developed close personal relationships with my son and every kid in the school.  I spent enough time volunteering in the school to notice how well they knew all the kids and how easily they joked and chatted with them about school work, friendships, and odd-ball interests like Star Trek or ice cream flavors.  At the same time they suffered no nonsense from the kids, they both clearly loved being with the kids and seeing them grow from 6th graders--still little kids--to 8th graders--on the cusp of adulthood.  I\'m so grateful these two generous women ran the school my son attended in these formative and boisterous years.', ""Parents who are looking for an outstanding education in a small middle school should seriously consider Manhattan East. The academics are challenging, infused with art and music classes; all are taught at accelerated levels in small classroom settings with individualized instruction. My son just graduated from ME, and I am happy to report that the school does not solely teach to the state exams. Watching The curriculum included many projects throughout the year in every class, and the teachers are well versed in advancing students within the classroom as needed, from which my son greatly benefited! The students' lives are enriched from reading Steinbeck and Shakespeare beginning in 7th Grade, as well as from first rate art and music classes. Watching my son do homework in 6th Grade was very interesting, as he read, wrote Perfect Paragraphs and history papers, solved complex mathematical problems and practiced Spanish pronunciation and grammar, only to then take out his saxophone to compose a small piece based on the music theory he had just learned at ME. I thought to myself, now that's the well rounded Renaissance-like education I had always wanted for him! Principal Lilliana Sarro is warm and inviting, as is the school's environment, always making sure that students had (and continue to have) outstanding programs and teachers. Assistant Principal Melissa Cancel is supportive and responsive as well, and they will both be missed. I think it's important to know that I always felt welcomed at ME, while my child always felt encouraged to flourish and grow.\n\nFor parents who are concerned about guidance into high school, Carmen Ocasio is the best guidance counselor I have ever experienced. Not only did she offer us continuous support from the end of 7th Grade through 8th Grade, while taking us through the high school interviewing process step by step, she was also available by phone and/or email. I am very pleased that my son will be attending Beacon High School in September!\n\nWe are all grateful to have had such a wonderful middle school experience at Manhattan East, and will greatly miss the truly caring staff, teachers and administrators. They made quite an impression upon us and I know they will on other families as well. I noticed recently that applications to ME are now available online at the Manhattan East website. A visit to the school is also a must! Manhattan East is a hidden jewel in NYC, and is well worth it."", ""My daughter just graduated from ME.  It's not exaggerating to say that this school has changed her life.  Coming out of a tough 5th grade year in a school with administrative problems, she has blossomed over the past 3 years with the support of ME's staff and administration, and will be attending an extremely competitive arts high school (PPAS) this fall.

However, the bigger issue for your brother is that ME does not offer an intermediate classical strings program, altho in the past, it has offered elementary strings. ME does have an excellent jazz band, so if your brother would be willing to learn double bass, he could have a wonderful experience at the school.  In the past, ME has had students who came in as guitar, electric bass, or cello players who made the transition successfully to double bass.  Please note that all students accepted to ME pick an instrument suited for symphonic band, and learn to play that instrument.  The symphonic band is amazing!   My son came in as a guitar player and learned to play tenor sax at ME. He played in both the jazz band and symphonic band at ME, and was subsequently accepted to LaGuardia HS.  Generally, learning another instrument increases a student's overall musicianship.  Otherwise, if your brother's heart is set on cello, he would be better off trying to apply to middle schools that have an orchestra or strings program.  You are right to think about this early.  There are not many middle schools with decent instrumental music programs, and many are selective, so please encourage your brother to also do well on his state ELA and math exams.

My child started their first year there in Sept 2013, since then my child has has had at least 5 science teachers, 4 ELA teachers, 3 Spanish teachers, and 2 technology teachers. When asking the the principal why this was happening, we were told these teachers were hired and then later let go or switched to other classrooms because they did not meet the standards that they were looking for. I'm confused why hire teachers that don't meet the school's standards? The teachers don't read IEP's for special education. I have to call constantly to have them read my child's IEP and have them follow it. I was assured that the school did cater to children with special needs and the truth is yes they accept special ed students but no they do not adhere to IEP's, nor care to unless you bring it up to them first and insist that they read them. There is also a big problem with discipline in this school. The children are out of control in the classroom and the teachers don't know how to handle them. The so called Deans of discipline just yell and intimidate the children, follow them as they walk from class to class, hand out detention, and claim to be the eyes and ears of the school. But under their watch my child was hurt and bullied by other classmates. And lastly my child is present at school every day and on time, yet I continuously receive phone calls saying my child was late or my child was absent.

""How to do we resolve this?"" was the lead question that was asked publicly by Garg and what led to much opposition. I honestly think that many parents keep things as is in order to weed out working class families who are looking for a good solid education, as you really need the resources of time and money to supplement a child\'s education that this school does not provide. \n\nPROSPECTIVE PARENTS BE WARNED: this school will require you as a parent to do a lot of your own teaching at home, or provide the extra-curricular studies and tutoring. There are ZERO assessments done at the school as far as fundamental skills building is concerned so assessments will have to be done on your own to find out if your child is meeting the skills for his or her grade level. Report cards are handwritten by teachers and really don\'t provide the practical feedback that parents need. There is an expectation from parents to much of the work in math and ELA fundamental skills building. For a full-time working parent this is tough.

04M610,"['PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!! LOTS to say about this one.. in all honesty please do not send your child here. firstly the grad rate. TYWLS loves to brag about our 100% graduation rate but it\'s actually a lie. I\'ve spoken to former tywls students who HAVE been dropped. yes, dropped. TYWLS will find juniors who are not doing well their junior year and drop them from the school. This allows the rest of the juniors who are doing well to move on to senior year ensuring they will graduate. I\'m not exactly sure if they help these students find new schools to transfer to or they just drop them without any direction butttttttt...... also to add on, my friend had told me once she had a meeting with Ms.Colleen about her grades (Drew is no longer our principal) and was essentially told to only focus on one class and fail the other she was struggling in because it would be too difficult to handle both. I know it sounds ridiculous and hard to believe but if you were a student you would understand. It\'s awful our staff don\'t encourage us to try our best when really all they care about is their reputation. Ms.Colleen is a bit lost and doesn\'t seem like a principal figure, really Ms.Vega (the vice principal) is the one who takes that role although she doesn\'t have the title. However Ms.Vega isn\'t the greatest either. She can be a bit mean here and there and sometimes seems to be too preoccupied to help students when they really need it or might need somebody to talk to. Now, the ""sisterhood"". TYWLS claims to be a supportive environment when in all honesty the staff don\'t really care about you. again, for them it\'s all about reputation. Girls aren\'t really nice to each other and lots of bullying takes place but it\'s also an all girl\'s school so i think bullying/mean girls is inevitable no matter what. Again, bringing back the word ""reputation"", we don\'t talk to ANY of our sister schools in the other boroughs AT ALL and tywls east harlem only really cares about themselves (aka NOT the other tywls schools in nyc) and their OWN (say it with me) r e p u t a t i o n!!! opportunities here and there which is one pro. Also academics is really all about the student i find it to be pretty easy while other\'s find it challenging. But teachers honestly can\'t grade and will hand out 70s all the time instead of actually grading fairly. However, ( i forget the name of these group of students) who have extra time and shorter tests, etc actually get easier work!! I\'m in the normal track. and for example while everyone in the normal track might do bad on this one math test the other students with ""shorter"" but really easier tests often pass with flying colors!! I\'ve seen one of my friend\'s grades who is part of this group and she has all 90\'s in her classes meanwhile I\'m in the normal track struggling to bring my geomotry grade up to an 80! It\'s really unfair seeing kids on honor roll who really didn\'t earn that spot and seeing them all of a sudden act all cocky and treat me with sympathy as if i don\'t get the material.

TYWLS has been such an amazing school and I'm glad I have gotten the chance to attend (I wish I came in 6th grade!) The teachers are so supportive, and are there to tell you reality and push you to do your best. I remember having an issue with punctuality and the amount of support and care I received from my teachers that all came together to help me stop it was beyond heart warming. Also, the school has such a nice bond and spirit where we really do come together as sisters to get things done. For example, with the recent political climate and election, juniors and seniors organized a walkout protest to protest about the injustice happening. The amount of opportunities here are also great as we are a CBI (College Bound Initiative) school in which we have a college counselor who takes time to help us with the college process. For instance, I have college counseling class two times a week in my schedule (which is great because not a lot of schools have that). No school is perfect and so, there are some downsides. Such as how we have a small gym that is also our auditorium. But, we are still able to play sports and we do in fact have a joined sports team with two neighboring schools nearby in which we use one of the school's gym (so it kinda all works out!). Also, we do have to take the elevator to school and Mon-Thurs after school (as the lines might be long but...sometimes it comes in handy! because it could be pretty tiring to walk up nine flight up stairs). We do though, take the stairs for changing classrooms. As it is a small school, our school is located in an office building and so floors 7-11 are ours. TYWLS EH being a small school is a great advantage because you really get that one on one support from all the staff and teachers. I've never felt such a sense of community and love from a school that empowers women, our educational future, and what it truly means to be a leader and lead the way for our future and those to come after. I highly recommend TYWLS because as they say, girls really do learn and focus better when boys aren't around!"", 'this school is the worst thing you could ever put yourself through, all the teachers care about is the schools reputation and act completely different once a visitor enters the classroom ', ""Followup on the bullying issue: I was always under the impression that threats to kill students were taken very seriously and fell under the zero tolerance policy. I was disappointed today to find out that my daughter was threatened to be killed by the same student for the second time in a week. She not only threatened to kill her but that she would get to her by finding out where she lives by way of the 'blue card' that parents have to fill out and return to the school. This student has only received verbal  warnings first from a teacher and then today from the dean. I am in utter shock that this matter isn't receiving the attention it deserves in light of so many tragedies that have already occurred because of the lack of reaction. I am hoping that the next comment on here isn't another tragedy (Godforbid). "", 'can you go out for lunch??', 'nope', ""Yesterday we were finally able to speak with Carlos, the dean.

Hopefully, we can resolve the other issues."", 'Last year i was ecstatic to find out my daughter was accepted to one of the top schools in East Harlem! She was attending a small elementary school and i thought it would be a great transition. Unfortunately, i must say that i regret making the decision to even apply to TYWLS. I am incredibly disappointed with the support, management and the so called Violin program! \n1.The teachers want to treat the students like adults.  I think that should be expected by the end of the middle school years, not the first year coming from an elementary school. Most 11/12 year olds need as much support as possible while they\'re entering a new environment, encountering new policies and going through puberty.\nParent support: i must call the main office  212 289-7593about 6 times(maybe more) before i finally speak to someone. I\'ve also emailed the teachers and one teacher responds half the time, the other teacher never responds.\n2. Management: Finding a good school your child can attend through 12th grade is usually a positive for parents. We assume that the older students would set an example and the teachers can manage the students.  Well, not the case!  There is a student that bullies a lot of the other students. She steals from them, threatens, hits and verbally abuses them.  My daughter witnessed a fight in one class and saw the teacher turn her head to the opposite direction.  She doesn\'t feel safe, didn\'t want to go to school and feels like the teachers are too afraid to address the situation.\nElevator mgmt: students are required to be there by 8:40. She has to stand on line to wait for one of two elevators.  One time she was on line at 8:32, but since seniors have priority they get to skip the line.  Whenever this occurs, she is marked late.\n3.Violin program: The question is what Violin program.  They hand a student a violin and they say practice.  In elementary school she met in a small group with a violin teacher twice a week and had beautiful concerts. She amazed so many.  Now her skills are regressing. In the beginning of the year she had her first TYWLS  concert.  I left work early, invited 4 family members and 1 friend.  Oh my goodness, how unbelievably embarrassed I was.  The ""concert"" lasted literally 3 minutes. I spent more time waiting for the concert to start.  Did i mention they had to dress up for this 3 min concert or they would recieve an F for music for that quarter. Then they had the nerves to announce that the so called concert was just to get parents in for a PTA meeting.  I was so furious and have not gone to one PTA meeting!  Deception is not the way to get parents involved.\n4.My daughter really wants me to mention the food issue as well. It\'s public school lunch, so not much can be expected. However, cleaniness can and should be controled . She found a bug in her food one time.  The window guard above the food is dirty. The water containers are dirty. \nI have started to look into other schools.  This time I\'m not letting reputation convince me and I will ask to speak to the new students. ', 'I also have a 6th grader at TYWLS and I sympathize with some of your complaints.  Communication for me with teachers has been great, but not so much so with the administration.  I have e-mailed one of the principals and never received a response.  They generally give very short notice about events, changes to the schedule, etc.  I too was very upset about the ""concert""/trick-parents-to-attend-the-PTA-meeting!  On top of that, some parents were lectured by a PTA dad when they decided not to stay for the PTA meeting.  I have attended some meetings and felt they were disorganized and a waste of my time.  My lunch complaint is that my daughter says they never have much time to eat.  She brings lunch from home, and even without having to wait in line, there is still little time.\n\nI will say that my daughter has spoken to me about one particular 6th grade bully, but I know that when her adviser became aware of the situation, she thought of ways to intervene.  Although the girl is still having issues (not easily solved by teachers), it has not gotten so bad that my daughter didn\'t want to be there.  In fact, she wants to stay there through high school.  My daughter has teachers that she really, really likes and often comes home talking about exciting lessons both in class and in the after school program, Girls, Inc.  I feel that the teachers are genuinely invested in my daughter\'s education.  Girls, Inc has been a great way to spend the extended day.  My daughter has gotten to participate in some really interesting and engaging activities through them and I know that they are really looking to ensure her success in school.\n\nAs someone who sees firsthand what can go wrong in middle & high schools, I have to say that TYWLS is doing better than most.  There is definitely room for improvement, especially on the communication front (I hope the principals are reading this- you need to respond to parents, too!).  But overall, I think it\'s a good, safe learning environment where girls can thrive.', ""I'm glad you're not experiencing the same lack of communication with your daughter's teachers.  It becomes extremely frustrating when you're a working parent and aren't able to be present physically.  However, I am looking forward to parent teacher conference day.  Although, the teacher that I wanted to speak to the last time, regarding a stolen project, wasn't available.  \nMy daughter also says she doesn't have enough time to eat.

Leaving middle school, I was afraid that I'd be just another face in crowd, but the support and sense of camaraderie between the students, teachers, and staff eased all of my concerns. Most of the teachers make lessons engaging and are there for students for academic help, but they are also almost always ready to lend an ear and give us support on circumstances beyond the classroom walls. Of course no school is perfect and not all of the student body will have the same views as I do, but it is important to remember that the faculty and the administration are not solely responsible for giving each student a spectacular experience. We as students must also take initiative to make it the best four years    (or seven years if you are entering the school as a sixth grader) it could possibly be.

The principal is a knowledgeable educator but uses aggression and shame throughout her interactions with the children and parents. She has publicly shamed children, targeted specific children, ignored parents emails requesting social and emotional support,  blamed the victim in bullying experiences, and spoke poorly about parents to other parents.  Meetings she runs quickly move from focusing on  school issues and move to her personal gripes with parents, students or other staff. Her unprofessionalism makes it difficult for a child with special needs to get the services they need if she disagrees with the plan. She runs the school through intimidation and fear.

That said, our family\'s overall experience has been more negative than positive due to two major problems. First and sadly, influencing and overshadowing everything else, the principal is nearly impossible to work with. Her aggressive, controlling, and disrespectful persona has students, parents, and teachers giving up on contributing to CPE2 or asking for their special needs to be met and just trying to stay out of her way so as not to get yelled at. She publicly shames students and teachers, often for behavior that she arbitrarily decides was unacceptable after the fact. This all by itself is enough for us to have stopped recommending the school to other families and instead to have begun warning them away. But there is a second major problem and this has to do with CPE2\'s approach to the Common Core curriculum and the introduction of high stakes testing. I share the rejection of high stakes testing but the campaign to force all students into opting out was not well thought out or carried out; instead of reducing stress levels for students we found that students were more anxious, even if they didn\'t have to take the actual test, because they heard it talked about so much, were falsely led to believe that it would be their own responsibility if their teachers were fired for the school not having high enough test scores, and they were bringing home hours of test prep homework anyway. This is the nucleus of the testing problem in my opinion: the more damaging aspect is not the test itself, but the choice by a school that calls itself progressive to abandon project-based learning in favor of lots of classroom test prep and heavy homework loads based on worksheets the teachers are downloading from the NYS Common Core website. We chose CPE2 because we believe in the progressive philosophy; it is a curriculum which, when done well, is actually more rigorous than mainstream curriculums and which builds students who are better at skills like critical analysis, problem solving, independent research and learning. Our child, however, only participated in one major project, in third grade social studies, in the entire time at CPE2. Otherwise both class time and homework time were taken up by worksheets or timed independent reading (the focus was on number of minutes read in order to ""build up stamina"" for how long the testing would require instead of on understanding content or engaging in characters and stories) which had no relevant context other than the Common Core standards.\nIn short, CPE2 has been completely demoralizing for our family and we can\'t imagine things will get better as long as the current principal is in charge.

It is a work in progress, but that progress is going in the right direction.', 'The DOE dropped plans to co-locate TCCS in the PS 36 building, <a href=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170407/west-harlem/department-of-education-teachers-college-community-school-ps-36-co-location-scrapped?utm_source=Master+Mailing+List&utm_campaign=c7caaf2563-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_04_10&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_23e3b96952-c7caaf2563-75750697>DNAinfo reports</a>.', 'The power of a strong parent community in our school - so proud for standing up for our kids \n\nhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170301/west-harlem/teachers-college-community-school-ps-36-colocation-education-school', 'TCCS parents are dissatisfied with a plan to co-located the school inside P.S. 36 in the 2017-2018 academic year to add a sixth grade class to the school, <a href=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170216/east-harlem/co-locate-tccs-ps-36-harlem-doe-plan-space-issues?utm_source=Master+Mailing+List&utm_campaign=846eced0fe-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_02_17&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_23e3b96952-846eced0fe-75750697>DNAinfo reports</a>.', 'I have been a parent at TCCS for four years now, and am in full support of the education my twins are receiving.\n\nMy twins are currently in 3rd grade and are at different learning levels. Throughout their education here, teachers and administrators have been very supportive of their individual learning levels and what I could do to make sure they both succeed. This was very important to me that they were seen as individuals. My twin-A is on and above grade level; twin-B is below grade level in some subjects. Every teacher since kindergarten has provided me with additional support for twin-B in the subjects she needed it.  This is so helpful to me, as I do my best to support my children’s learning. There has never been a time I have made a request to meet or speak with teacher and the request not been granted. The teachers are so invested in their students! \n\nIn addition to the committed teachers, we have Teachers College Fellows throughout the building supporting our learning. The Fellows are part of the regular school day and the after school programming. Our partnership with TC provides our students with the vast resources that other public schools in district 5 do not.  This is a powerful tool to our success. \n\nTCCS has always had a small town feel, where teachers and parents care about each other. The parent community is very engaged.  The principal works closely with parents to maximize the best learning environment.  Last year the school was in the mist of transition. Yes, there were parents that were unhappy with the new leadership of the school, and yes, there were parents who had the wait and see approach. But we made it though! \n\nAll children learn at a different pace, and TCCS supports students at their individual levels.  I am proud that we have a diverse community of learners because everyone here supports you. Now we are in our second year under the leadership of Mrs. Verdiner and I am optimistic she will continue to strive of excellence from each student. \n\nAs a parent you need to decide what is important to you. Being part of a nurturing, engaging learning environment striving for excellence was important to me.', ""My son is a fourth grader this year. I find these reviews to be disheartening and untrue. There is good and bad in every organization. TCCS has had more than it's fare share of bad. Yet we seem to be thriving. \n\nI was brought up to believe that if you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but this negativity doesn't do anyone any good, especially the kids. All of these reviews that blame the school for their kids issues or that they weren't catered to in a certain way are just bunk. Complainers are never solvers.\n\n We as parents are responsible for our children's behavior and educational needs. That decision of whether or not a particular school is a good fit or not should be based on your child's specific needs and not because you feel the school won't bend for you. Not every school is a perfect fit. \n\n For every person that has a complaint about TCCS I can give you a hundred that just love it. We love it. We are a family. It is a place that supports a child's emotional and educational growth. The staff is just  wonderful and we have made some life long friends in the other families. \n\nIf you want a big city school with a Midwestern feel TCCS is the place for you."", ""This is our first year at TCCS and we are truly enjoying our experience here. We have found TCCS to be a welcoming and nurturing environment with a strong sense of community. The curriculum is well-rounded and geared towards the needs of each child. Once per month, parents are invited into the classroom to participate in “parents as learning partners. “ This is a chance for parents to observe the classroom and participate in activities with their child. The Parents Association is very active and involved in several aspects of the school's operations. There are a couple of great onsite after-school programs that are offered with Teacher’s College Clubs (free) and Roads to Success (very affordable). We are very happy with our choice to send our daughter here and look forward to her younger sister joining her next year. The greatest measure of the school so far is that our daughter comes home with a smile on her face every day, eager to tell us what she learned."", 'This school was a nightmare for us. We were so excited to get a spot but it quickly went downhill from there. Our child\'s teacher was brand new and clearly in over her head. She turned out to be a very poor communicator and though we knew our child was having socialization issues all year long, the teacher was no help at all. When we escalated concerns the the ""administration"" (one ill-experienced new principal who exhibited no leadership skills whatsoever, spoke out of both sides of her mouth oftentimes and paid lip service when it came to ""consequences"" for bullies and other behavior issues.) Our child went to the nurse more than 25 times in one year and there was nobody interested in why that was. If we had known that we would see no improvement over the course of the year (our child\'s class watched full-length Disney movies every day over the last weeks of school!) we would have taken our child out long before. It was a completely wasted year. The social/emotional issues which were never addressed at school are now blatantly obvious to camp counselors who have done MORE IN THREE WEEKS than our child\'s teacher did in an entire year. The after school program wasn\'t any better. Fortunately we had the good sense to withdraw from that problematic environment midyear. \n\nI absolutely agree that the children and other families in this school are lovely. The community is what kept us going and both my child and I and my spouse made lasting friends at TCCS. (However, there\'s also a culture of intolerance to criticizing the school, if that makes any sense. At times it felt a bit like we were in Stepford.)\n\nBut it takes more than good families to make a successful school for everybody. The resources are severely lacking. We see in hindsight that our child would have \nbenefited from regular interventions with a social worker or school psychologist but neither are these people available at this school nor were the teachers/administration in a position to recognize the need in our child.\n\nTwo thumbs down, zero stars.', ""I have two children at TCCS, a student in grade two and one in kindergarten.  Both of them have been there since pre-K.  They love going to school every day and are engaged at a deep level.  My kindergartner's writing, nurtured by the Reading Writing Project, is amazing.  My grade two student receives incredible enrichment programs in addition to excellent classroom instruction. \n\nMs. Verdiner has transitioned into a very challenging situation given the unprecedented circumstances of the previous principal's demise and the poor math test scores.     She has handled the situation with aplomb.  We feel confident in the direction the school is heading.  We support the principal's efforts to nurture academic excellence complemented by strong science, music and art programming."", 'Parents from TCCS have countered claims in a <a href=""http://nypost.com/2016/01/17/school-still-in-turmoil-months-after-principals-suicide-parents-say/"">New York Post article</a> that criticized new principal Michelle Verdiner.

An anonymous person or persons did so without consulting our community. No one has taken responsibility and it is certainly not representative of the general feeling at TCCS. \n\nMy daughter, now in 3rd grade, has been at TCCS since kindergarten. We made the choice to travel 60 blocks downtown to attend TCCS rather than our zoned school and at no time have we regretted our decision. For a public school, the offering are excellent. The community is wonderful, the teachers are great and my daughter has flourished. There is homework and there is a good amount of structure (including uniforms), which were things that we chose. TCCS is a new school which comes with the expected growing pains, and the last year and the loss of our former principal has not been easy, but as a community I believe we have come out of this experience stronger. Principal Verdiner walked into a very tough situation this year and has handled it admirably. When we\'ve had issues her door has been open to us and open to my daughter at all times. We think she\'s doing a great job and has been a strong advocate for our school and our community. And despite the fleeting ""political noise"" the kids are happy and thriving. Not only do we love this school and highly recommend it but we also plan to send our son here when he\'s ready for pre-k.', ""I've got two kids here who started in pre-k and I think the school and the community is amazing.  Ms V had an incredibly difficult job coming in this year when everyone was still in shock over Ms Breeden, and she's risen to the challenge.  My kids are happy to come to school, the teachers are great and warm, there are lots of extras that you don't see at other public schools (violin, swimming, coding, science lab).  It's incredibly diverse, arguably one of the most diverse in Manhattan.  It's not for everyone (it's a new school in a spotlight, with all that is good and bad that this entails), but for families that value community and diversity in an academic setting, I cannot recommend it highly enough."", 'The person(s) who sent this letter did so anonymously and without support or backing of the majority of TCCS parents.
