Ive learned that even the dean has put kids to fight in the bathroom so they can release the agression they have agaisnt one another. How safe can that be having kids in the school  bathroom fight by someone who should be proecting them by all means we leave our kids with them from 8-3 and they should make sure they are safe. not mistreated they say this is a gifted and talented school i dont see how gifted this school is. The principal is an obnoxious person who shows no respect to the students. They definitely dont repremend any of the kids who misbehave they just allow it. All they want is good ratings so parents could send their kids there. The neighborhood is bad. Kids smoke and drink on school  premises where is the safety department at shouldnt they be protetcting shool grounds and walk their turf to make sure none of this is going on.. But since is not their children they care less what happens to yours. Parents i think you should do your homework whenm considering this school walk the neighborhood on a regualr school day onec in the morning and at noon so you can make a better choice when choosing a school. This is not on of them. they are here to help and improve our children for the future not jus give up on them.

After reading this new review about The Bronx New School it saddens me to see the lack of time and effect put into writing this review. If more was written about the curriculum and how well the school has moved the children from good to great, which would've impressed me. As a parent, I need to know more than just the gossip being told around the block. To be fair to Mrs. Gail I reviewed one of her earlier opinions on another school (which is operated by some previous disgruntle teachers from The Bronx New School) and was amazed to see how organized and wordy their review was. 
If you cannot be neutral in your review then you are only doing a dis-service to the many parents that view this site, like me.
 
Let me put this out there to ALL those parents that feel the Principal and certain staff knew about the TCE. They worked in that school day in and day out, why would they jeopardize their own lives. Give them a break; be upset with the real people responsible. No one knows the whole story about what really went on at the school not even the staff. 
 
The Bronx New School is a great school. The administration, staff and children make it a great place to be. Like all schools there are problems and disgruntle parents along with unhappy staff.  Parents do not allow one person or a small handful of people to decide for you. Visit the school!

What a person does speaks volumes. AND when testing was done not once, not twice..but repeatedly...he wore his muffle and kept his mouth shut.  With my own eyes I have seen that he did have a air purifier in his office though...had it for quite some time...so he may have felt queasy himself and he did SOMETHING about THAT.  Bottom line...not only were the kids affected, so was his staff.  So you can stand in your right to defend whomever you want.  Great things I'm sure are happening educationally at the school...but you have to be in a place of wellness to receive the benefits.
Parents whose children who have experienced symptoms, that we now know are related to TCE, have a right to be concerned and have a right to not only question, but demand, that there be accountability for ANYONE who has your child for 7 hours a day takes your child and you presume them to be out of harm's way.

You are not preaching advocacy but hatred. Whatever your experience may have been with the school, it was your own. Reading your comments gives me the impression that you are bitter and NOT because of the TCE situation. 
My goal is not to defend anyone. Nor do I find it worthy to point out several of your lies and inconsistencies. I find it actually amusing that a “Parent” like you continues to review this site daily and rebuttal EVERYTHING and ANYTHING positive about the school. My purpose is to inform parents (those that can look past the smoke screen and BS) that The Bronx New School is a wonderful school.  The more you bash The Bronx New School and use the TCE as a clutch, the more the school continues to move forward with the Principal as the driver. 
I too spent countless time at the old location and NEVER saw anything that would make me believe that the principal and the staff were hiding anything. You must’ve been the sole person to see an air filter in the Principal office. What I saw was a shredder…
I am like the innumerable other parents that followed the school to the new location and have no resentment towards the Principal.

And this prevailing view was encouraged and allowed. A cadre of teachers were allowed to run amok. Teachers were considered ""mavericks"", ""innovators"" and decided what to teach without regard for NYC and NYS Standards because they knew better than the powers that be. Since Paul's (we use first names here) arrival there has been much improvementand not just in test scores.  We have a leader who cares, he has a vision for our school(teachers are guided by the leader's vision not the other way around), collaboration and RESPECT for all voices, not just a chosen few. It has been a boon for our children.

10X051,Daniel Jones,bronx,Elementary,187,"Before Paul arrived, there was incredible collegiality among teachers, between teachers and admin, and among parents, teachers and admin. To say that Paul engendered trust that was absent is a blatant falsehood. We knew we would miss Esther whose retirement led to Paul's appointment, but in a very short time, Paul created an atmosphere of animus, distrust, and ruled top down in a school that had a history and tradition of agonizing to gain consensus over even small decisions. Paul did away with multi grade grouping by fiat. He drove away gifted, committed teachers who love their profession and loved the children fortunate enough to have class with them. Fortunately for District 10, many of these teachers formed The Bronx Community Charter School where one will see no posts ghost written by the principal to congratulate himself or some Orwellian post about setting those maverick teachers straight that they don't run the school. Bronx Community Charter School is a home for those wonderful mavericks and thus a great place for children and their families to land. I certainly hope the best for BNS. My children all graduated from there and in those years that I was head of the SLT and Esther was the principal, it was what public education could and should be. That tradition is carrying on at BCCS, and I hope can be reignited at BNS now that Paul is gone.

They pick out the top 20% performing students in each grade for these classes. Students can be recommended to enter or drop out of these classes according to their progress over the year.  They work about a year ahead of the rest of the grade. In my opinion the school's strengths are that it does an excellent job of teaching ESL and low-income kids, a good job of teaching literacy to native English speaking children, it's a safe and friendly place, and diverse in a very positive way. Kids of all ethnicities and backgrounds are mixing, getting along, and learning good things from one another.   Its weaknesses are the crowded classrooms, dismal math (though not any worse than most NY public schools from what I've seen), and skimpy extras.  It would be great if the school offered a bilingual program to benefit from the school's strengths.

When I first moved to this city after my parents divorce my zoned school was P.S. 330 but my mother went to this school in the 1990s she knew that this school was was the kind of environment she wanted her children in and Mr.Bernarndo knew her well, so out of the kindness of his heart let both my sister and I in. I went to PS.86 for six years before I moved on to private school, and in those six years I learned so much but the two teachers that I have to thank for my success and for putting up with me have to be my second grade teacher Mrs.Saperstein who taught me that no one said hard work was going to be easy, but she promised me it was going to be worth it and Mr. Egan my fourth and fifth grade teacher who helped me grow socially and academiclly he always had a different approach in the classroom if the student didn't get something right away. My younger sister attended private school and always had a problem with reading, my mother pulled her out because we discovered her to have dyslexia and no other school truly had the special education support that she needed besides P.S.86, with her zoned school being P.S.330 she scheduled an appointment with Mr.Bernardo and begged him to let her in and give her a chance and without hesitation he said ""she's in don't worry about it"" he didn't close the door on her he opened it. I was sad to hear he retried but all good things come to an end. If I ever have a chance to meet Sheldon Bernardo ever again I just wouldn't know how to thank him. He gave my sister's and I a shot at success and a quality education.

Several times my husband and I just walked right up to my sons class, the security guard didn't ask us to sign in more or less show ID. I'm concerned with the kids safety. We recently moved to the Bronx from Harlem and the school my children attended didn't NOT let us to the our kids classroom unless you had ID and sign the log book, one time I forgot my ID and had to go back home and get it, I was alittle upset but more so happy because I knew my child was safe. Until this day my son misses that school, of course for his reasons. He wants to go back. Please tighten up the security, have all parents show ID's and sign in. For the children's safety.

The separation of academies feels like there are four different schools even though its just one big school. The division of academies is based on academics of each student. Even though there was tension among each academy with each other at times when I attended, most of the time students do get along with each other. I might have not at times but I was given the chance to make all kinds of friends those three years I was there. From sixth grade till eight grade this school really changed me for the better, I was able to get out of my shell and become way more out going. Spectrum academy really challenged me a lot and even though it seemed like way too much work back then but now I'm currently a tenth grader now in a school in Manhattan and a straight A student since freshmen year. And since we take high school level subjects in this school everything I learn now in high school is easy peasy. This school does offer regents to everyone in 8th grade no matter the academy and sadly I didn't take any (which I regret!) but if a student does takes it & does pass it during their freshmen year they will no longer take those classes and will get to take AP classes if the high school offers it.

Everyone is supportive and is there when you need them. Also, students have the oppurtunity to go on amazing trips, take regents tests, and prepare for SHSATs which are specialized high school entrance exams. I find this school so amazing.

This school does not create a welcome environment for it's students and instead creates a hostile social environment, where learning and education is not the main priority. If you want to ensure you child receives the right education I would suggest you send them into Manhattan and choose from one of the numerous quality private schools available. RKA is mainly comprised of low quality public servants whose main concern is retaining their job. Public education is supposed to inspire hope that the taxes paid are serving the best interest of the people. RKA was based on the promise that regardless of income students would have the same access to a good education, and by extension be prepared for the future.

I have been overwhelmingly impressed with the attention and help that w have EACH  received. I did establish grom the beginning that I wanted to be in communication with the teachers and they were all receptive. The beginning of the year was a little bit of a struggle for my child, but after a meeting, where almost all of the teachers were in attendance, we developed strategies to help him. From there, the grades only improved. That is just one example of the access the teachers provide.

Although there are several excellent teachers who have really helped and support him, the principal (as has been spoken of in the past) avoids any possible conflict if a parent has a question or concern. As an educator and adult, why would you avoid me as a parent of a student?  Isn't that counterproductive?  You will get the basic generic answer, which is probably why so many parents do not bother to say anything.  Might it be the socioeconomic situation of the parents? Maybe those from lesser means or not as articulate, or perhaps just don't give a crap about their kids -- could that be it?  While they impress upon the minds of the parents to speak up, attend the bogus ""Coffee with the Principal"", etc... you will not get any support if you do, especially if it goes against their line of thinking.

I came in at a very high proficiency level and let it all slip away due to truancy - I can not say if it would have helped, but being paired with mentor or counselor might have helped.  Nevertheless, I still tested in to Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Music and Art choosing the later and attended the later. The commitment to honors students was high then as well.  Mentoring, supporting student activism, and making sure that the non-honors kids feel valid and have a path to their future are important ways forward.  Alternative gym credits and eating options may be the best way to overcome deficiencies is those areas, as well as developing local community volunteerism in the arts - use computers, internet, the close K-5s etc.  Students and parents can propose, plan, and promote anything if they are committed. As to the HS, middle school division - why not propose a close mentoring program - a big sister, big brother program at the school level for academic and social development and integration.

The school has an extremely dedicated and hard-working staff, both administrators and teachers.  It is always striving to improve and expand.  And it cares about its kids.  The funding situation has improved, and there are signs now that the funding may improve even more in the near future.   Considering how well the school has done with insufficient funding, it is exciting to imagine what can happen when the funding is there.  I like TAPCo.  I like the students, the staff, and my teaching colleagues.  I am not alone when I say I have no plans of leaving and am excited to see the growth and continuous improvement.

     A creatively-inspiring, educationally-gripping and nurturing environment in which to thrive and grow... This is TAPCo! 

Under the relentless determination, caring, and devotion of exceptional Principal Ron Link, accompanied by an extraordinary staff of dedicated teachers/human-beings, TAPCo proves itself day after day, to be a blessed oasis for the students fortunate enough to go there. So much more than just a ""high-school for the performing arts"",  TAPCo is a journey for learning, for discovering, and for growth. At TAPCo, the student is seen as ""a precious individual""... appreciated and applauded for being who THEY are. A student's unique attributes are valued above all and serve as the vehicle for their education.
     In addition to the many exciting avenues a student can travel at TAPCo regarding the performing and visual-arts, TAPCo covers all the bases when it comes to College preparedness. I should know... My daughter has been proudly accepted into the top universities of her choice, seeking a promising career in Broadcasting-Journalism and Theatre. In conjunction with my daughter's hard work and excellent grades as a student, it is TAPCo that has made so much of her college-preparation possible through the several internships, workshops and research-study programs made available to her throughout high school. My daughter's dreams for the future through a fine education and opportunities are being fulfilled because of the the superb guidance of Senior College Councilor Eileen Houlihan, Principal Link, and all that TAPCo has made available to her. 

     TAPCo is a safe, bullying-free haven that welcomes, embraces and encourages all students to reach for the stars! Principal Link and his diverse staff of caring teachers INSIST on a bully-free, bigot-free, and judgement-free environment for all. If there is one thing Principal Ron Link WON'T TOLERATE... it's bullying and meanness in his school. The goodness, kindness and time bestowed to all students by the faculty, makes TAPCo a school to be held up as a proud example of what a school can be. 

     TAPCo has served as a phenomenal stepping-stone for my children. Consider letting TAPCo open your child's door to an exciting and productive future. A FIve-Star Review! BRAVO!

10X225,Aria Soto,bronx,Middle,192,"I'm a senior here at TAPCo, set to graduate in June 2019. Ever since I've been to this school (I started here in sixth grade and now I am in twelfth), I have received support from the teachers. The students are a mix, between some who create an environment of toxicity, somehow freshmen skipping every class and exhibiting symptoms of senioritis in their first year, and students who exhibit nothing but positivity and acceptance-- But isn't that just how teenagers are? That's what high school has always been. Many people complain about this school (we've been promised lockers since I was in sixth grade, and we just got them now), but they don't actively participate in the amazing changes to come. Yes, I'm sad that these changes aren't moving as fast as we would like, but I also know TAPCo had a rough history before I even got here, before we switched principals, and we are still recovering. I have been here as long as the current principal, Ron Link, and I've seen his drive to create an environment where the students can flourish, his enthrallment with everything we do. He truly has a passion for leading this school, and cares deeply, showing responsibility for his students. This year, we are doing a production of the musical, ""Urinetown,"" and he attended a rehearsal, watching us learn choreography, his face lighting up as he saw our drive and our enthusiasm for the arts. This school truly does work hard to facilitate our needs, and I hope the improvement I've seen start continues even after I'm gone. The teachers teach at a slow pace (which may be to allow the average student to keep up, but it doesn't challenge me in the slightest) to enhance comprehension, they offer their lunches up to help students, they listen to ideas on everything from shows to their new rooftop garden (which should be opening soon). The arts programs help students by giving them opportunities to see professional shows (priced up to hundreds of dollars for the average attendees) for free and provide networking for students who plan to go into the industry.
Overall, this school is decent and i cherish my experiences here. I am proud to graduate a TAPCo Tiger.",0,0,0,2019-04-01T14:39:04,0.75,0.078,0.198,0.047,0.20199999999999999,0.21899999999999997,0.7859999999999999,0.026000000000000002,0.21899999999999997,0.7290000000000001,0.021,0.228

10X225,TAPCo Teacher,bronx,Middle,192,"I have been a teacher at TAPCo for the last 11 years, and I have seen a lot of positive change throughout that time. Of course there are challenges on a day to day basis, but these challenges are a general part of teaching. Academically, TAPCo has added 4 AP classes in the last two years - AP U.S. History, AP Language, AP Capstone (Seminar and Research) and AP Computer Science. There is ample opportunity for students to receive additional supports from teachers when they are studying for Regents exams. There is lunchtime and after school Regents Prep, and teachers in the High School do a good job of making sure to build in time to review and prepare students during their classes. There are programs in the building that also have helped students in both the Middle School and High School have a voice in their local community, specifically through working with Generation Citizen in the 7th, 8th and 12th grades. Additionally, in 8th grade students have the opportunity to take and pass the 9th Grade Algebra and Living Environment Exams, meaning that they can enter High School with two regents, and multiple credits, already on their transcripts.

There have been many other improvements in the building since I have been here as well. Six years ago, students, staff and parents signed petitions for things that they wanted to see change in the building. As we all know, things in the DOE move slowly, but we have started to see the fruits of those petitions. In the last few years, the school worked to bring in a Health Clinic to the building so that students are missing much less time for illness and doctors appointments. I often have the clinic call down to my class so that I can send a student up for an appointment that day. This year, EVERY student in the school (Grades 6-12) got brand new lockers (there had been no lockers in the building). Further, in May there will be a grand opening of a brand new Rooftop Garden performance space that will give students at every grade level the opportunity to learn how to garden using a state of the art greenhouse and garden planters  - something that can be integrated into science classes in the building. It will also give a place for classes to go during fall and spring to have discussions outside and to see arts performances. 

Overall, all this is to say that TAPCo is not a school without faults, but that it is a place that has a caring staff that is working hard to improve for all of the student that go here.",0,0,0,2019-04-01T12:41:05,0.75,0.078,0.198,0.047,0.20199999999999999,0.21899999999999997,0.7859999999999999,0.026000000000000002,0.21899999999999997,0.7290000000000001,0.021,0.228
10X225,j.w.,bronx,Middle,192,"I recently visited to TAPco as a Children’s Education Manager in district 9. What I saw was a school serving a very rough and undeserved community, very well.  While students get the opportunity to learn about the arts, they also learn about all the elements behind the scenes of productions as well. This school was nominated as a Best High School in America in 2016 by U.S News & Reports. They based this date by comparing TAPco with the other schools in the geographic area. So while the test scores are still below the citywide average, it is out performing the other neighborhood.  Also, the ELL students at this school are performing above the citywide average. This is attributed hiring teachers with bilingual certification and school focus on the social needs of a child. On the day of my visit, a student came in with no jacket on a brisk winter day. A staffer noticing, discretely took him into a room where he could select a coat.  The school is not big on suspensions. They utilize Restorative Circles that allows kids and staff to develop communication tools and address issues through discussion.
Yes, bullying does exist at this school but there are many avenues of support and conflict resolution. I saw students freely come up to Principal Link to help them resolve a conflict. They already used their tools, but came to an impasse. He willing went over and within a few minutes it was resolved. I know not all situation end like this, but knowing supports exists helps. They have even used dramatization to express the harmful impact of bullying. The community has gangs and staff has been trained to look for signs of trouble. The school has also formulated a strong relationship with the police precinct.
While many schools are skimping on math and science, TAPco integrates arts, creativity and core education together in STEAM programming. I saw Mr. Mudrick (A CTE Award Honored Teacher) utilize an investigative experiment, “The OJ Challenge,” during math class that had all the kids focused.  In Stage production, Bud Thorpe, performed an experiment explaining how electricity and magnetism works in preparation for a lesson on circuits and wiring. Band class was being taught by Professional Jazz Musician, Curtis Haywood, as he diligently trained students play both syncopated and modified renditions from the same selection of music they were reading.
TAPco, is working in an environment where at least half the student population is low income, entering 6th grade with academic remediation, even with the screening. They have been consistently improving and continue to fight for the same resources as other schools in their district.",0,0,0,2019-03-29T19:13:39,0.75,0.078,0.198,0.047,0.20199999999999999,0.21899999999999997,0.7859999999999999,0.026000000000000002,0.21899999999999997,0.7290000000000001,0.021,0.228

10X225,TheHighschoolStudent,bronx,Middle,192,"i have attended this school since 6th grade and i am now a 10th grader, this school is filled with false promises, and special treatment, i was one of many who did not have to ever audition for the school, but there were others who had to go through long audition processes. the school is very cheap looking. the ceilings are made out of some type of grass, or hay, they are not concrete. there isnt any "" homey feel"" since the school is small it often feels very overcrowded, and there is nothing but lots of cliques, who dont associate with anyone but those who sit at their table, the teachers do not ever sit or eat with us. i have been trying to leave this school for a long time now , but the staff will often force you to go through many hoops, only so they can tell you ""you cant leave the school"" i have good grades, and attendance, and me and my parents have been trying to get me out, yet this school would not let me transfer. once you attend this school there is not getting out. the kids often bully the teachers since there is often 30 students in one classroom. although we have a new principle he has not communicated with either us students, or the parents. he has not told us anything about the future of this school, and has not changed anything. It seems we have another principle that will not help our school. The chorus is a joke, our teacher had to leave in march because he was no longer being paid, and for the rest of the year we had a science teacher watch our class, while we did nothing. the acting class does nothing but talk during the period, the dance class only does like 1 show a year while chorus has to preform at least 1 show every month. and the art class doesnt ever show their work and gets a new teacher nearly every year, because the last one always ends up quitting (i used to be in art class) you cant join the chorus class until you are in high school. this was very misleading for me because the school claimed to offer a chourus program for all the grades which was why i attended this school in the first place. the bathrooms are often flooded, so they are  usually closed for days, and we considered lucky if even one water fountain works. highschoolers are not allowed outside the school for lunch, and there are no lockers (and i mean physically there are no lockers in the school), there once was a time when there was lockers, but the studednts werent allowed to use them. there are NO trips at all, last year there were no highschool trips, and since 6th grade i have only gone on 3 trips. there is way to much drama around the school, often resulting in fights and class disruptions. the attendance record is false many students cut school everyday, and there are 5 ways to leave without getting caught. one semester i had 10 absences and on my attendance record it only said i was absent twice. also students from the school 391, in the same building have a stupid rivalry with us, one year on the last day of school they threw eggs at everyone. the school security is bad as well they often curse at the kids, when telling them to go home at the end of the day. the list can go on and on, this school is horrible and there are only a small handful of teachers that are good. this school promises alot but once you see it you will be dissapointed, and if you ever want to leave and transfer schools they wont let you.

10X226,Anonymous,bronx,Elementary,414,"I don't think the principal at this school (iF it has been the same principal for the past 4 years) has her priorities straight.  I think that she is someone who will start an opportunity for the sole purpose of gaining appraisal from others. I think she is focused on getting nice publicity more than anything else.  From my understanding, she is a tough leader and that educators in the building fear crossing her path on issues. FYI Principles really do run the school and it is a good way to judge a school. Cool.... Ray Romano's brother works there but that doesn't mean that it is a good school.  The grades prove that.  It's not the community, it's the school that is the problem. One good thing is that even though the Principle may have the wrong ideas, she does help to get a lot of cool things in the school.

I don't like this description of the school.  Actually I generally do not like any of them because they only have some facts about the school (like performance statistics) and they tend to point out the positives.  (sigh)

This review (like the others) talk a lot about the colors of a building (""omg the colors, how positively affected I am by these colors!"") and the positives (but not so much positives).....

So they gave some bikes out with raised money that Ray Romano's brother helped to raise....  The students there don't need bikes (Keep in mind that they may need things like better textbooks, books, supportive teaching materials, learning technologies and maybe even basics like food, clothing for themselves and their families or maybe leadership and quality training for their staff).  Also keep in mind that bikes are hard to have in community where households are usually overpacked apartments in areas that don't provide outdoor bike parking at all.  I don't know if they received helmets and bike locks along with the bike.  I don't feel it's good to reward good grades with bicycles in a school that needs an overall boost in providing quality education and a boost in providing simple attention to every single student in that school.

I would have done a community event that promoted education, study and positive self-esteem.... free food, raffles, books, close up street for bike rides, rollerblades, maybe get some speakers to talk about education.

The kids need more than knowing who Ray Romano is and that if they get a good grade, they'll get a bike.  Schools are supposed to be about community. Sharing and educating each other.

The teachers are inexperienced.  As a principal, you job is supposed to develop leadership and strength in your teachers. What seems to be happening is that there is just the opposite.  The Principal seems to welcome the weak teachers so that they fall under her plan.

I like (sarcastic) how the summary mentions a grant that is providing money for a new auditorium and gym.  With the wording of the review, you assume that this school is a big school with all these great, cool things going on and that the school is so great that its getting money for new auditorium and gym facilities.  It fails to mention that this school never had an auditorium and a gym! It has I believe one big multipurpose room (very odd, I don't know what the designers of the building was thinking).  

 The environment that the Principal has created in that school is almost like a mad house with many brief instances of euphoria.  I believe this Principal should be demoted to a teacher and should get a principal who has better ideas about community and love.

It's not totally the principals fault... the community is rough and there are not enough facilities and space in the school.

Ray Romano's brother, (if you ever do read this) bro, you've got a lot of influence.  Fix this!  Be a leader and teach leadership.  Help the community.  Bicycles, paper, computers, buildings will rot, break and disappear. But teaching some new soul in this world to love himself and believe that he can do absolutely anything if he chooses to go after it. He can learn anything. and facilitate that learning.  This will never go away. This is what teaching is about.

Fyi,  I've only heard about this school from others but from what I read here, I see that there is definitely something not right. I get that feeling.... but they do get some good work done too.  Just not enough of the essentials in supporting the little peps.

The school gets good leads on opportunities.



The principle, Ray's Brother. Ray Romano. No one is perfect.  Not even me. Mr. Anonymous.

Being at JBA has been a breath of fresh air for our child and family. The teachers work collaboratively with each other and instead of marginalizing kids, they set the scholars up for success. The teachers make themselves available before and after school for scholars who may need extra help. While some schools view parental involvement as a burden, it's encouraged and paramount to your child's success at JBA. The firm uniform policy allows the students to concentrate on learning and offers them a true sense of community. My daughter feels safe, valued and respected in her school community. Hard work and accountability is required as it should be. Principal Gonzalez and her staff are high-quality educators who truly want the best for your child.

I do believe that it is worth it to put it as your first option. The downside is that the gym is very small and it is very hard to pass the math curriculum. The specialties is that there is a lot of after-school activities and the teachers offer extra help (this school also has a lot of technology involved). The uniform for gym is navy blue sweatpants or navy blue basketball shorts with a gray top. The regular uniform is khakis with a navy blue collar top that you can wear with the fleece sweater the sweatshirt with the logo on it. You MUST always wear all black shoes.

It is made up of a collaborative team of innovative individuals, who really push to understand our scholars and their interests and needs when providing instruction.  Though our school has been through an administrative change, our current principal, Ms. Gonzalez, has really shown a dedication to collaboration among teacher teams and to providing scholars of JBA with a sound education and presenting them with several after-school programs and different outlets to help balance their academic and social lives. JBA has had the privilege of working with an administrative team that has really fostered an environment of trust and respect for both teacher teams and scholars alike.  JBA is an inviting school and has a welcoming environment.  A top priority of this community has always been to engage and communicate with our parents and bring them into the school and update to learn and celebrate what their children are learning and hear first-handedly from them about their progress in class.  Our principal, Ms. Gonzalez, has an energetic spirit about her that really drives the school and sets the tone of commitment teachers have for scholars and the commitment of scholars towards their academic and social/emotional lives.  Our principal and assistant principals know every student in the building and are the first and last ones in and out of the building each day!

Each time I am there, what I see (in terms of kindness and respect among teachers and their students) leaves me wishing that every child in our city had access to this type of middle school experience. JBA is a gentle place with smart teachers who are attuned to the learning of their students.

The level of the staff's dedication is also notable. Last school year, the principal and school community instituted a policy that teachers absolutely must depart the school building by 6:30 p.m. at the latest because administrators wanted to support the work-life balance of the faculty. Until that time, in the years prior, many JBA teachers would remain at the school well past 8 p.m. (on their own time) collaborating, preparing for the next day's lessons, and literally giving their all to the school. Still, almost every teacher supports either a before or after school tutoring group and welcomes students during lunch for extra help.  Teachers volunteer to assist with school functions on school nights and on weekends. They know each child inside and out, and wouldn't have it otherwise.

the school. However being an 8th grader is stressful, because now teachers are
giving us so much homework, I stay up 1:00 am in the morning to finish it. This
is because once you get to 8th grade the students have to deal with finding a
good high school and making sure their grades are on task with everything. Not
only that but, supplies you need to buy for your child when starting school. I
say this because from 6th to 8th I bought supplies and at the end of the year I
had some of the supplies are not even use, making my parent wasting there money.

for your child and by the end of the year he/she use only 2 to 10 pages.

As a parent I cannot express the gratitude, respect and admiration that I have for the entire JBA staff and faculty, not to mention the administration.  As a parent of a child that is bright, smart and has potential, but not without behavioral problems, the staff works with us (my son &amp; I) to ensure that he works to his full potential.   Every school should have an administration like this.  If you are a veteran of the DOE and you are stuck in the era of paper, chalk and old teaching methods then it's time for you to retire.  This school works with differentiation, as well as collaborative teaching to assure that all students are able to work to their full potential.  A school that has combined different teaching methods and is completely technically advanced is what we, as parents want for our children.  I have visited schools that to this day, still do not work with smart boards and are behind in all tech areas.  This is unfortunate for the students, faculty, and parents because of the world that we live in today; being computer and technically knowledgeable is a must.  Ms. Chumney has been supportive and the administrators have given old and new teachers, the support they need to see all alumni's succeed. As an administrator and working with 70 plus personalities isn't an easy task.  If you had to agree with every single person that worked for you then what you have is disorder, bedlam and anarchy.  Let's get a reality grip for all the disgruntled employees that chose to leave JBA, any school that you work in will always be a problem.    They are developing a website that is informational and a resource for all parents and persons of interest.  Keep in mind that even after the recalibration of the State scores most school went down and this school remained A status, This speaks for itself.  I have felt the respect and professionalism that the faculty has for each other, not a selected few but administration strives to give everyone the reverence they deserve.  The warm and inviting atmosphere is welcoming to parents, I'm not intimidated nor am I ever demoralized.  I voice my concerns to Ms. Chumney, she never dispatches me to the Assistant Principals, and she stops whatever she is doing and fields my concerns.

There's not that much drama unless you do something like curse at one of the students ... sometimes they dont even bother to start fighting; they just ignore the problem which is the best way to deal with it. The principal : Mr.Weeks, is a intelligent principal, & everytime he sees something in a bad condition he fixes it right away! :) The dean (Mr.Portonova), mainly takes care of the 6th, 7th & 8th graders. He might look really tall & mean but once you actually get to meet him he is really cool & empathizing. The assistant principal (Ms.McGill) is really cool & smart too. She actually set up 2 blogs on the school website; one about books us kids should read & one about science & math. To tell you the truth, our school website is very very interesting & it will keep you on FOREVER! I'm in 8th grade now & Mr.Portonova told us all about the fun that's going to come up after all the hard work . For example: senior trip, prom, graduation, & a surprise for us 8th graders.

I have to overall say the technology at this school has advanced to a next level in modern society. This school uses everything from virtual reality to technology on a board with very awesome learning strategies. I also would like to say the new principal at this school for the last 4 years is very wonderful and I would like to say the environment at this school has been very much improved from the last 5 years I was at this school and I am glad to say their are more programs at this school including after school help for students and also regents help as well. I would like to say my overall 7 years at this school was fun and very awesome and I would like to say I really like that this school has a debate team for middle school and that their are sports teams and like I said many programs that the students benefit and I would like to say the staff members at this school are amazing including all new staff members I have known in 12th grade which in my final year was very exciting and wonderful as well and I am happy with the overall education support I got from all staff members at this school. I would also like to say I would recommend this high school to any parent or friend and also say that this school is one of my favorite schools that I have attended since I was 11 years old and I am proud to say I even graduated at this school as well for both middle school and high school and I wish the best success to every staff member and every student that currently attends this school and any future student as well.

10X368,Winston,bronx,Middle,480,"I am a graduating Senior at this school as well as its valedictorian. The days left of school are in the single digits now. I have spent the my last 6 years here (since the 7th Grade). Originally I had wished to go to Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, or any of the specialized high schools. Needless to say I failed to get in. I don't know how my life would have turned out, but I do not regret staying at IN-Tech. Without a doubt there are things this school is missing and it certainly lacks an abundance of motivated students. Even so compared to many other schools in the area, simply put, IN-Tech isn't so bad. From here on, I will be referencing my own experiences and hope that you will glean what you are looking for through them.
One of the largest complaints I have heard about this school is its lack of technology- despite being a technological school. On the contrary the presence of technology is larger than you may expect. However my immediate advice for those who want to interact closely with tech (aside from those who simply want access to a computer) to join either the media club or the MOUSE Squad. Both of these clubs have worked closely in recent years, largely as a result of the students' close interaction, and will allow you to interact with a variety of tools such as cameras, computers, software, hardware equipment, and our new 3-D Printer (you can thank MOUSE Squad'14 for that). 
I do not know much about the administrative staff, but my experience with the teachers were wonderful; once I showed my seriousness and my ambitions for greater heights, they showed their support in encouragement and helped me through my struggles. During my time here I have only had ONE very unfavorable experience with ONE teacher. For the most part my teachers were supportive, capable and inspirational. 
I have looked at other high schools in the area and quite frankly IN-Tech doesn't compare so badly. We have our own building, no tedious metal detectors, a modern aesthetic look, and a majority of good teachers (so long as IN-Tech doesn't let go of another one- I am criticizing the school for letting a certain capable APUSH teacher go last year, 2013). Admittedly this school doesn't have enough opportunities for everyone but this is NYC! To any high school students I encourage you to find non-profits and youth communities around you. A few I have worked with before, and helped me develop my resume and professional skills, are MOUSE, REV, GEAR UP, Global Kids, and HIVE NYC. Welcome to your first step in the real world kids: intro to looking for opportunities. Good Luck and I hope you never regret a decision you make.",0,0,0,2014-06-03T15:06:04,0.75,0.213,0.2,0.079,0.10800000000000001,0.235,0.7170000000000001,0.031,0.071,0.863,0.025,0.21

This school only worries about attendence, uniform policy and the appearence of the school. The attendence they care about so much because this is how they get their $$. This school doesn't care if your child learn or not, a lot of bullying has and is still happening. They don't do anything about it. When there's opportunities for scholarships, trips to places and other things, only immigrant kids go. They never give less fortunate kids the chance to grow and the teachers like to use sterotypes on students. My english teacher from senior year told me I was going to be no one in life just because I told her I didn't understand the assignment. Also this school has been in a lot of scandals and they love to call ACS if your child hasn't been in school for 1 day. I don't recommend this school for no one!

10X368,Ana,bronx,Middle,480,"First of all, the only reason as to why this school worries about the attendance is because in order for a student to receive a good education they will have to attend school. Additionally, the uniform policy is essential because students will have to learn how to dress professionally. Addiitonally, this school does care about the education that students receive and those students who excel in certain skills are offered more opportunities than others because they express true determination and dedication towards their education. It is a lie that students receive more aid if they are immigrants, everyone is treated the same because we are untied as a school. Your statement about the school does not only explicitly falsifies ""facts"". Everyone is encouraged to perform their very best and to be self-reliant learners. Your statement about the school is your own opinion and it should not negatively reflect the school.

10X368,Vynn,bronx,Middle,480,"@disqus_Gwdmf3auhZ:disqus I perchance crossed this particular post and imagine my surprise! Firstly I'd like to congratulate you on your attempt at advocacy- very powerful language and I quite enjoy reading your post. I am also a student of this institution. Although I am unsure whether or not you are a high-school senior or a middle school senior, I do disapprove of the method in which the school handles things- especially their act of removing efficient teachers from the high school department to either to middle school or out of school. However forgive me for nitpicking but there are a few things I'd like to correct on the technology portion. Technology is very expensive, the newer versions of the iMac cost almost two grand each- multiply that by 30 for a room and 30 we have. They aren't the most recent- I believe those are the 2010 or '11 versions and this ""Mac Room"" is restricted to middle schoolers. The ""Old Dell"" laptops with XP are slowly being transitioned out and replaced with newer Lenovos with Win7. The majority of the school is already on Win7. 
The administration is a gathering of buffoons, no doubt about that. On the middle school section they have removed the class system and gave students are more personalized individual schedule. Sounds good? No. Students are in chaos. The idea of moving High-school teachers who are adept at teaching high-school students out of the school or to have them teach middle school students is preposterous! 
So yes, I do agree with some of what you have said and support your attempts. But be wary of exaggeration (so far as I know, people do not use drugs on the grounds). All in all, the school building itself is much better than some schools I have visited. Our classrooms are more modernized, not divided into A/B partitions and we have our own building.  The teachers, for the most part, are dedicated to their job and provide help if the student shows interest. In conclusion, was my experience at IN-Tech bad? No. Are we more technologically advanced than many NYC public schools? Yes. Do I disagree with the administration's recent actions? Definitely. Do I dislike certain staff? Who doesn't?! Is this school going to the pits? Maybe. Do I really care about what is to happen in the following years? ... Not really.

Now all the teachers we have are recent Manhattan grads that have little to no experience. This school gets money from grants/ donations etc. for improvements in technology but there are almost never any improvements. This school, is supposedly all about technology but they have old dells, out dated macs and software, you can never find a printer that works!The PTA doesn't do anything productive and I've been here since 6th grade.  IN-Tech is all about keeping up appearances. When the DOE comes to inspect they tell all the students and staff to be on there best, they tell students to raise their hands even if they don't know the answer, and teachers that can't teach all of a sudden teach for a week and have lesson plans.  It's time for someone to speak the truth. SO you know where I'm coming from, I'm a very well regarded student in this unfortunate school and have many friends that graduated prior years. They tell me how much they dislike this this school for its lack of teaching and resources.They don't even waste their time visiting.

like a big family, we help each other learn, and grow. The students get
opportunities that aren't given in other schools like getting certified in
Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) and getting job opportunities with the CISCO academy. This is a great school foreveryone, as long as we are ready to

I’m currently a junior at IN-Tech Academy, and I must say
that so far I have had a good experience in high school. I entered as a
freshman, because as you may know there is both a middle school and high school
within the building. But my point is that although I entered as a freshman I was
able to adapt quickly. Of course, it’s hard to start off when you first enter a
high school where there will be people who already know each other for many
more years, but it’s an easy environment to adapt to, and the adults within the
building automatically take you in and you feel right at home. I have had a
chance to achieve very good grades so far and maintain myself on the honor roll
thanks to the excellent teachers which we have. I’ve definitely had great
opportunities come my way this year as an Entrepreneurship student. Our teacher
Mr. Davis definitely provides us with plenty of information such as
internships, and summer jobs that in the long run helps us out and provides us
students with experience. As well as our counselors which are a great deal of
help for us when we need it, especially our CBI counselor Ms. Martinez  which begins to work with us as soon as we are
juniors to prepare us for the college process. I believe we are being prepared
for college and work. The overall experience with the variety of activities is
good and fun experience.

My experience at IN-Tech is a very good one.  IN-Tech Academy is a phenomenal school, from the first day you walk in you will feel as though you belong. The staff are amazingly kind, they will look out for you in every possible way. In fact the staff had found me a job at a community center by the name of Riverdale Neighborhood House. This school is great for anyone, but it is especially great for a student such as myself. The reason for this is because I am interested in technology. They have a great technology curriculum that is thought by an experienced teacher. They will allow you to take certification exams for free, this can help you better yourself in the future. They also have another great program called virtual enterprise, it allows you to get a feel of how the business life will be. Overall this school is THE best within a huge vicinity of its area.
