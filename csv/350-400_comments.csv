Behaviors of a small percentage of violent and aggressive students are allowed to continue daily with little or no consequences to these students as they assault teachers, vandalize school property, and engage in fighting and bullying behaviors.

He has also been bullied numerous times, being slapped, punched, thrown on the ground, trapped in the bathroom, called names & harrassed, including racial slurs (he is Puerto Rican but was getting bullied for his light skin and the music he likes) yet the school administration does nothing.  We told him not to start fights but have had to instruct him to fight back against bullying, especially because the school is doing nothing to protect him. The school tried to punish him for fighting back against his attackers! 

This school may not be as bad as many in the Bronx but why compare yourself to the worst instead of the best?  Since he has gone to this school district his spelling, math and overall academic skills have spiraled down and we are back to sounding out letters (a sheet he got from his wonderful Kindergarten, outside of the city).  The second grade teacher was very sweet (Ms.Lee) but the classroom is so crowded there is no time to pay attention to each child.  I have not heard of kids playing keyboard or learning other languages.  Their school flyers say ""Keep An Open Mind"" so I did but the school & administration has failed me & my son. ",0,0,0,2012-09-05T23:14:58,0.75,0.016,0.266,0.09300000000000001,0.76,0.125,0.659,0.013999999999999999,0.757,0.198,0.011000000000000001,0.292

11X083,Thank you,bronx,K-8,1648,"P.S. 83 is floundering under the current principal. There are very little to no standards when it comes to the educational, emotional and physical needs of the students. Students with severe behavior problems aren't disciplined and teachers aren't equipped to deal with these students. The staff has become so apathetic to the fights and safety of students they seldom do anything when fights occur nor do they file the requisite OORS reports. Students are allowed to curse, steal, cheat, and discuss their sexual perversions during class time and absolutely nothing is done. The message being sent to students is you can break the rules and absolutely nothing will be done except your teacher will buy you pizza and a Carvel cake for your birthday which is what occurred during 2017-2018 school year. 

If that's not bad enough, many of the staff are racist and xenophobic against the Latino, Black and Middle Eastern students. The predominately Italian-American staff seem resentful of having to educate the bright, brown and Muslim! Their expectations of minority students is low. They go out of their way to make students of color feel unwelcome. For example, during the 2017-2018 school year Stella Kontolios encouraged her 8th grade class to say vile things about the Little Rock Nine in a class assignment. She was also very open about her politics, not to teach her students, but to make them feel uncomfortable about who she supported when she knew her students did not feel the same way. Also, in an effort to marginalize the Spanish and Arabic speaking families, the school has no support staff that speak their native tongue and don't utilize the DOE's Translation Services. 

Many of the staff dress so unprofessionally it's no wonder the students don't take them seriously.",0,0,0,2019-06-26T15:23:00,0.75,0.174,0.203,0.044000000000000004,0.915,0.11900000000000001,0.636,0.098,0.07,0.48100000000000004,0.33799999999999997,0.135

11X096,Cymon231,bronx,Elementary,897,"I graduated from PS 96 in 1949 and my children graduated from PS 96 in 1969 . I would like to understand why it was re-named for Richard Rogers a composer. When I was there and my children were there, there was nothing connecting Mr. Rogers to the school. When I went to PS 96 the school was 98% white. Now it has changed and I think the name should reflex that change. I understand the school is now 60% hispanic. I think it would be nice, if you are re-naming a school to rename it after someone the children can relate to. They can have pride in there school, named for  someone in the Arts they can connect with. 

When I went and my children went to PS 96 -the focus was on reading and writing. Every child could read by the third grade and write a complete paragraph . We wrote stories, book reports  and read books and did the new math. I don't remember any of my friends or my children's friends that were such budding artists that they needed a special art program . Most of the children  can  expand their art in Bronx House, or wait until they get to junior high school or high school. This is nice but if the children are reading at  55.3% maybe it's time to put your focus elsewhere. 

On more issue that concerns this past student of PS 96 and that is your portable school rooms. I'm  puzzled. I went to 96 ,my children went and my granddaughter started there. At that time the border for the school was Parkside Housing to Thwaits Place and White Plains Road to Bronx Park East. Every piece of land was built on. Lyn-Rec was already up. Every house and apartment building was filled. The High rise across the street from the school was filled with people and children. However, in 1985 there were no need for portable classrooms. If no new housing stock has been built since 1990, Where are  all these new families living with all these new children. I know that up until 1990, you could not go to PS 96 unless you lived in the area. If that has not changed perhaps you should verify the address of your children. There is no reason to have 22 portable classrooms. Your Assistant Principal wants PS 96 to have all the things that Westchester schools have, well first no school in Westchester has 22 portable classrooms. The most I've seen is 2 portables at a school. The parents would not permit more.

11X096,Cymon231,bronx,Elementary,897,"I graduated from PS 96 in 1949 and my children graduated from PS 96 in 1969 so I know the school well. I would like to understand why it was re-named for Richard Rogers a composer. When I was there and my children were there, and my granddauthter there was nothing connecting Mr. Rogers to the school. When I went to PS 96 the school was 98% white. Now it has changed and I think the name should reflex that change. I understand the school is now 60% hispanic. I think it would be nice, if you are re-naming a school to rename it after someone the children can relate to. I know if you were to try -you will have a tough fight getting an hispanic name passed by the school board and the community planning board, but it would be worth the effort for the children.  They can have pride in there school, named for  someone in the Arts they can connect with. 

When I went and my children went to PS 96 -the focus was on reading and writing. Every child could read by the third grade and write a complete paragraph . We wrote stories, book reports  and read books and did the new math. I don't remember any of my friends or my children's friends that were budding artists that they needed a program for. Most of the children  can  expand their art in Bronx House, or wait until they get to junior high school or high school. This is nice but if the children are reading at  55.3% maybe it's time to put your focus elsewhere. 

On more issue that concerns this past student of PS 96 and that is your portable school rooms. I'm  puzzled. I went to 96 ,my children went and my granddaughter started there. At that time the border for the school was Parkside Housing to Thwaits Place and White Plains Road to Bronx Park East. Every piece of land was built on. Lyn-Rec was already up. Every house and apartment building was filled. The High rise across the street from the school was filled with people and children. However, in 1985 there were no need for portable classrooms. If no new housing stock has been built since 1990, Where are  all these new families living with all these new children. I know that up until 1990, you could not go to PS 96 unless you lived in the area. If that has not changed perhaps you should verify the address of your children. There is no reason to have 22 portable classrooms. Your Assistant Principal wants PS 96 to have all the things that Westchester schools have, well first no school in Westchester has 22 portable classrooms. The most I've seen is 2 portables at a school. The parents would not permit more. As I understand it, the Schools  get paid by the state per student each day they attend class. Therefore, it is to the Principals benefit to have all these extra students in those 22 portable classrooms. The school gets paid more.  ",0,0,0,2013-02-08T22:39:21,0.75,0.08,0.21600000000000003,0.055,0.6759999999999999,0.156,0.757,0.039,0.19399999999999998,0.645,0.10800000000000001,0.32799999999999996

The principal doesn't care about the students and he lies about everything. I honestly only liked my 5th grade teachers and they were amazing. But, my 4th and 3rd grade teacher was so rude and selfish to me. All she talks about are her dogs and how cute they were. I didn't like her because I was the new kid in 3rd grade and somebody brought a pack of lighters. Without anybody saying anything SHE BLAMED IT ON ME! I got into so much trouble for NO REASON!!! I was only 8 at the time and I didn't know what to do. Another situation happened to me in 4th grade when a first grade teacher thought that I gave her the middle finger when I didn't and she GRABBED MY ARM AND YANKED MY HAIR TO THE PRINCIPAL""S OFFICE!!!!!!!!! The principal didn't believe me at started to LAUGH AT ME!! Super unprofessional! And my mother was called that I got into big trouble, but I also told my mom about the teacher who yanked my hair and we went to see the principal the next day. He was looking at me with a nasty look. We told him what happened and he said  SORRY WE CAN""T FIRE HER BECAUSE OF WHAT YOUR STUPID CHILD DID!!!!! I was in shock! I even started to cry. About a week or so we forgot about that situation. I am now in 7th grade and I look back at this school and all I get is horror and unprofessional people who most don't know how to do their job.

In my class, Only I, and a girl got over a 80% in ELA. Mostly everyone else in our class failed for lack of attention. Last year when i was in 7Th grade, my class had the worst grades in the whole school. We were literally hated by every teacher. Once a teacher called us ""little b----es"".

And when I got there? I thought my suspicions were right. 

However, I really think you graduated with possibly the worst class that year. Because last year, we had sixteen students who were accepted into a specialized high school. And we have those who got into Bard and Celia Cruz. The school isn't as bad as you think it is.

The teachers I've had so far were VERY helpful. The principal takes care of what goes on in the school. The guidance counselors make it their responsibility to make sure the parents know what's going on. While we did have much more kids enter, recently, there aren't fights every-single-day. 

Have you taken Regents classes? From what you have said, I'm assuming that you did. Even in the non-honors classes, students have to read more than three books and my homeroom teacher last year made us turn in 25 book reports. 

While there are 'bad' kids in the school, those are just now a tiny portion and are all in the same academy. Honestly? I think these three years of my life that I spent at 127 were pretty awesome, and I learned so much from observing and from what the teachers told us for future reference.

11X127,Katie,bronx,Middle,850,"Just the fact that you wrote your comment in broken english says so much. I graduated from MS 127 in 2005, my brother recently graduated in 2009 and I currently have a sister in attendance there. Let me assure everyone that 127 is literally one of the most disfunctional schools that could ever exist. Teachers are more concerned with being ""cool"" with their students than actually show them some disipline. Furthermore, curriculum wise, there is none. Teachers teach students what is relevant to State Exams and places an emphasis on test prep rather than teach them what everyone else in the entire country is learning. Of course students don't realize this because most of them end up going to Lehman Highschool, the zoned high school, where most of them are too ignorant to realize just how educationally under developed they are. Luckily for me, I graduated with honors as did by siblings because my parents take a personal responsibility to continue education in the household. Personally,  I read at least 3 books a week. Students at 127 would never dream of reading 3 books a year. When it comes down to it, if you are someone who is forced to place their students in 127 make sure you take a personal responsibility to continue educating your child at home because they will need it. As a result of graduating with honors I went on to attend Bard High School Early College where students graduate with both a high school diploma and A.A. Degree. Now I'm happily a junior in college with the world in the palm of my hands. In conclusion, MS 127 is the type of institution where there is literally as we speak, a 20 year old boy in the 6th grade who is dating a 12 year old girl. My family likes to call him super-senior. I'm sure I'll comment in the future to refeud any comments that may have insulted current students.

Not sure how 127 was way back when, but if you play your cards right, you can meet some really amazing teachers. Without my 8th grade Algebra teacher Mr. Soares (^.^) I would have never made it to Bronx Science. Yeah, if you behave like any ""normal"" student you won't find M.S.127 to be to your liking, but that's true of any school, be it Stuy, Bronx Science, or Clinton. The key is to apply yourself, and stay that hour after school, and come in 30 minutes earlier, and get to really know the people you see every week.

I think really think some of the teachers go over board. One 6th grade teacher for example started and argument with a student. After being put under stress by what the teacher said. he replied with something offensive and being suspended.

11X180,Gold The Hatcher,bronx,Middle,1016,"This is an amazing school. I get the bullying thing, it is an issue, but is very rare and bound to happen to anybody unless they wronged somebody else, and it has to be something VERY WRONG to get them up that point.

This school has lots of fights, indeed, but I guarantee you that you will never ever get wrapped into any of them.

Mr. T has anger issues (and is very ignorant) , yes, people tend to hate Ms. Rita, but in reality, she only gives tough love, and is a total sweetheart and Mom-like figure once you get to know her. 
I am on the step team, so I know.

The principal needs to do his job better, but the vice principals and all the staff members make up for his loss, and they help you learn and teach you new things in so many ways. 
Yes, you may have a few teachers you might hate or dislike, we all have those teachers along the way, but I assure you, bring your students to this school.

I am currently in the 8th grade, class of 2020 (or is it 2021?), and I love this school and the experience so far. Please bring your children here!
It will be worth it as long as you work with them along the way.

Yes, some teachers have attitude problems. Big ones. It is a ghetto school, but ghetto in a loving way. All the teachers will give you tough love. 

Please take a chance. Bring your kids here ! ! ! You will not regret it.

However, he, in my personal opinion, is inefficient in terms of managing those of the lower-class,( metaphorically comparing it to a hierarchy based on authority of teachers and those above them) making these schools run poorly.

The kids are divided into the schools and we all basically learn the same thing, so parents don't be confused. The bullying here is a 7/10. As you may know, middle school is where you find yourself and on that journey of doing that, many kids make fun of others as a joke, but personally I don't like it when people make ""fun"" of others. MS 180 is a school that expects so much from kids so if your kid ends up getting a 65 on their report card, the school is going to make a huge deal out of it. I still don't know if that's a good thing or bad.. The arts programs are amazing. The kids do curse and listen to rap music and date each other sometimes so the environment is okay.. I guess.

I'm in 7th grade right now in this school and I have good grades and I don't misbehave.
The teachers are horrible, my math teachers' way of teaching doesn't make sense, it's like shes just copying it right outta the book and writing it on the board.
Good way to teach, aye?
The teachers teach for their paychecks and not because their passionate about it.
Teachers also have icks.
I'll admit, in 6th grade I was a jerk to a few of my teachers, but now it seems like it's followed me around to 7th grade because I get in trouble with them almost all the time.
Teachers aren't perfect human beings that hold my education in their hands, they have lives too, and they bring their stress to work which affects my class all the time.
Also, the STAR, Moving Image and International children get treated better than the Law and Public Service kids.
Surprise surprise.

the teachers are racist too, and are rude to the students. One teacher, was kicking and hitting a special ed student.

This is a really good school. Like Fardin said, it has it's pros and cons.

Not all of the students are respectful to each other. I'd say about 95% of them are respectful to each other. Like any other school, there are bullies. I was bullied for my weight and my stutter problem and was driven to depression. However, the friends you make at this school are the ones who will always help you out, will listen to you, and care for you. 

Student life is pretty good. There are rarely any fights, if at all. Everyone seems to get along pretty well. Of course, there are some bad apples in the bunch, but it's such a small problem that it should be overlooked. Many students hate the uniform, but once it was put in place, the vibe felt even safer than it already was, no one would criticize each other for their clothes, since they had the same ones on. Recess is where it all goes down. The friendships, the drama, all of the regular activities you'd go through as a child and teenager. 

The academics are great, all of the teachers care about you and will always listen to what you have to say. They teach very well. I had a problem with a teacher in the Seventh grade, but this problem was dealt with and no harm was done to me or the teacher. It wasn't even intentional, the teacher didn't know about certain things I was insecure about and he mentioned them. I should've notified him about these things. To be honest, he was one of my favorite teachers, because he took me out of class and personally apologized to me. That day, he had a lot of respect from me. He did what no one would usually do in that situation. He could've written a letter, or sent me an email. But he apologized personally. The teachers here really care about their students. They're all really nice and use really fun methods to teach, and that really helps the student feel safe in the classroom and makes them want to learn.

This is possibly one of the best schools in the Bronx, and your child will be happy to spend their childhoods and beginnings of their teenage years here at PS/MS 194. 
They'll face hardships, learn about the realities of life, grow and develop into bright young students. They'll make friends, lose friends, figure out who they are as people. 
They'll meet wonderful people and do wonderful things.

When I graduated, I looked back to when I had heard about this school. I was entering the first grade. My mother and I walked into the school, they gave us a tour, served us lunch. I met some of the staff. And when I walked out of the building, my mom stopped and asked, ""Sergio, do you want to go to school here?""

I excitedly replied, ""Yes!""

It was the best decision of my life.

This truly is a wonderful school.

Ugh, I'm getting all sentimental, on Halloween! Can you believe it? 

Well, that is all. 

Until next time,

To make this short, several teachers coma out with their political views criticizing my choice for my senator Jeff Klein.  One teacher who states he is a working family party member  started questioning me on whether I understand what IDC stand for and how it hurts his district in West Harlem.


This other teacher came out and stated I was engage in illegal activities by giving out palm literature at the corner.  


But the Assistance principal was the worst one.  HE came out with his dog and stated he didn't like that I was there in such a nasty disdainful manner.  When I responded that I was exercising my first amendment right, he started screaming at me in fonts of everyone. "" dont you dare heckle me!""


I am so disgusted by this school's behavior.  FYI, the NYPD and the BOE employees made sure I was 100 feet away from the poll site and made sure I was in compliance with the election laws.


So not only doesn't this school teachers not understand the law but they are nasty and disrespectful.  


To say that I as a person of color who lives 2 blocks from the school was engaging in illegal activities  as well as stated they didn't like seeming me at the location was disrespectful.


Today I went to the school to speak with the principal but she was in a meeting.  She told her staff to give me a blank piece of paper to write my complaint.  When I ask for the name of the assistant principal, the guy stated the principal say it was against his civil right to give me his name.  when I ask for the principal name, the guy stated it issn't permitted to give out her name.

Our staff is continuing to develop programs like advisories, electives and field study which offer students a more hands-on, one to one method of education rather than antiquated strategies which have been proven not to work. Our school is pioneering the ""Opportunity Center"" which is the name we have created to replace the school's SAVE room (schools against violence in education). We changed the name to take the negative connotation away from the room because our students are not violent and don't need to be saved. What they do need is an opportunity to become better. We have come a long way in just ten months and have recently added a dean and guidance counselor to further address social needs and ease the transition between elementary and high school. Our goal for this third year should be for all members of this learning community to work together in solving problems and not merely point them out.

I wish the dissenting teacher was aware of the pride the students take in their design and that you can't expect the designs to be in the garden forever.

I think instead the teachers and parents should be more concerned with the vandalism which regularly occurs in the garden in the form of plants which are ripped out and thrown to die, the garbage that is thrown in the garden and flowers which are picked.

11X326,Dertferty,bronx,Middle,407,"""Bronx Green Middle School believes in its mission of empowering students academically, socially, and emotionally to make wise choices,"" writes a teacher. ""Naturally, with a lofty mission like this, there is much room for great successes as well as challenges. Principal Emily Becker knows that children are not merely empty vessels needing to be filled with knowledge, and challenges teachers and students to create their own unique path for learning and discovery. Since many teachers and students are accustomed to being told what to do and how/when to do it, they can find it challenging to adapt to Principal Becker's more creative and progressive approach. Fortunately, Ms. Becker does not waiver in her dedication to the mission nor in her love for the children, and she continually provides both teachers and students with opportunities to create, lead, and maintain new possibilities. This is evident in the Student Internship Program, the Garden Design Exposition, the 100% attendance Broadway show trip, the Advisory program, the Community of Unity/ Culture Club teacher group, the Literacy through Photography Program, and the plethora of academically based field trips taken to a wide range of places all over the city and out to Pennsylvania. Principal Becker either piloted or encouraged each of these programs with unwavering support. Staff does not yell, but speak with confidence, authority, and inspiration. Teachers respect students, and expect to get the same in return. Teachers lead advisory classes during which students get an opportunity to bond with peers in a small group and share concerns and successes. The advisors play a vital role in teaching students to be responsible, productive members of the larger community at Bronx Green and offer students an open ear and gentle guidance. By communicating in such a manner and offering such support, teachers encourage students to conduct themselves responsibly and respectfully, and while it is easy to focus on the few who do not, the majority of our students deserve to be celebrated for being positive members of a growing green community.""",0,0,0,2008-07-01T16:33:16,0.75,0.221,0.22399999999999998,0.059000000000000004,0.10800000000000001,0.165,0.767,0.066,0.179,0.59,0.15,0.293

It's mission sounds amazing but in theory the school is a nightmare,"" writes a teacher. ""In the past 10 years of working in the education field I have never seen a school so poorly managed. The principal, Ms. Emily Becker, is not in touch with the needs of the students and tries to befriend them instead of doing what is best for their academic growth. She manages behavior with stress balls and Tibetan gongs and does not implement strategies that are culturally relevant to the student's lives. Ms. Becker tried for 20 minutes to get the students calm and get their attention as they were running all over the auditorium, banging on the piano, running on the stage. She was so infuriated that she just walked out leaving all of the students alone and unattended. Her solutions to school discipline include statements like, ""the school would be more successful if we hired staff that looked more like them"", referring to the race and skin color of the students. Fights break out every day, students have physically and sexually harassed teachers, students have been caught having sex on the stairwells and there are no consequences for misconduct. The theme of Bronx Green Middle School is to have a garden. The garden curriculum is not comprehensive or linear. The garden is only for the 6th graders. The curriculum, created by the garden coordinator is highly unengaging with the students spending over two months learning how to hold garden tools. The only thing that students harvested from the garden and cooked with all year was the basil. The rest of the harvest went home with the teachers. The students worked for months on a garden design which is the most important day at Bronx Green according to the principal. Students presented their designs at a garden design competition which lasted less than an hour and most students didn't even get a chance to see all the other classes' designs. The winners were chosen by one class only and false promises were made to the participants. There was also no ceremony to celebrate the winners. Unfortunately, Inside schools missed all of this because on the day that they visited, the principal hid an entire grade all morning and coached the selected students in what to say to the reviewers.""",0,0,0,2008-07-01T16:12:16,0.75,0.221,0.22399999999999998,0.059000000000000004,0.10800000000000001,0.165,0.767,0.066,0.179,0.59,0.15,0.293

Students curse at teachers in front of the principal and nothing is done,"" writes a teacher. ""Students leave the building without permission constantly. When administration is notified that a student or that a group of students have been seen outside of the school building, nothing is done in terms of consequences. There are food fights in the cafeteria which often end with the floors and the walls being covered in food and beverage. In the beginning of the school year, the 7th grade classes were problematic, but now the 6th graders are beginning to follow the poor example of the 7th grade students. It is important to note that the day that Insideschools came to visit, they observed only 6th grade classes. Because administration knew that 7th grade behavior was less than acceptable, the principal called for an ""emergency"" Town Hall meeting so that the visitors from Insideschools would never get the opportunity to observe a 7th grade class in session. There was such an effort to impress Insideschools that the weeks prior to the visit, the principal, on several occasions, suggested that 7th grade teachers take the 7th grade students on a field trip to the Bronx Zoo on the day of the Insideschools visit. I still have the memos to prove that she tried to get the 7th grade classes out of the building. Because none of the 7th grade teachers wanted to take their students on a field trip, she knew that she had to do something to mask the problem- hence her last minute Town Hall meeting. If a school is going to be graded and judged, it is only fair that it is evaluated honestly and openly. Sweeping problems under the rug to present a good face does not provide potential parents, students, and employees with the truthfully information that is needed to make informed decisions.""",0,0,0,2008-06-11T16:16:47,0.75,0.221,0.22399999999999998,0.059000000000000004,0.10800000000000001,0.165,0.767,0.066,0.179,0.59,0.15,0.293

I miss it dearly because it is the best school i had ever went to. The teachers are amazing because they make their lessons fun and understanding to a students perspective. 
    The staff administrators are very kind to the students when it comes to misunderstandings or problems they have with other peers. The Guidance Counselor is also very committed to the students and everybody loves him as a staff member in the school. They are very supportive of what the students do around the school.
    The principal, Mr. Rivera, can and will be strict at times, but he does mean well to the students because at the end of the day, it all works out. The students respect him and his decisions even though it may not be fair at the time... but it is on us because he does it to teach a lesson of respect.
   If you want to come to this school, the reason and the only reason you should come (it isn't to make friends even though u do that in the long run) is to prepare yourself for what comes ahead in life... due to responsibilities and respect towards others. i love Pelham Academy and the model "" We are preparing you for life"", actually serves its purpose.

I recommend this school to all parents who are in need of a middle school. the faculty are excellent. they are attentive to your childs needs.  stay on top of the progress of your child. My daughter Maya just graduated from Pelham Academy and cannot stop whining about leaving this school.  We sincerely love Mr. Rivera, Mrs. Cartagena, the office staff and teachers.

They prepare your children for High School and Lifes Lessons. I beg to differ, if anyone has any NEGATIVE comments regarding the PA Family. Maybe their child was one of the very few PROBLEM CHILD who don't appreciate their child being taught RESPECT AND COMPASSION towards their fellow classmates.

The Rodriguez Family will alway have a special place in its heart. 2thumbs up!",1,0,0,2013-07-19T20:05:06,0.75,0.151,0.23199999999999998,0.048,0.37799999999999995,0.133,0.6990000000000001,0.087,0.16899999999999998,0.611,0.13,0.28300000000000003

It seemed that my daughter's teacher tried her best, but there was some friction with the principal and a few other administrators and that tension trickled down to impact the classroom environment.

11X468,Anonymous,bronx,Middle,332,"As a Parent of a former Student I find it strange that only students have commented. Academically this School is good but there are some issues that need to be addressed. There is a lot of cyberbullying amongst students and they often meet at a nearby park to schedule fights. The book says the school offers computer classes, but there are none. The Principal promised a PTA, there isnt one. Teachers speak nasty to students and are never disciplined. The Principal is known to curse at students and he and the Assistant Principal have threatened students in an unprofessional way. Other than that its a great school.",1,0,0,2013-06-22T04:07:19,0.75,0.151,0.23199999999999998,0.048,0.37799999999999995,0.133,0.6990000000000001,0.087,0.16899999999999998,0.611,0.13,0.28300000000000003
11X468,Anthony Rivera,bronx,Middle,332,"Thank you for your feedback.  As the Principal of the school, I a bit shocked to hear that ""I am known to curse at students"" and ""threaten them"".  I can assure you that is not the case.  I treat this job as a amazing priviledge and even bigger responsibility and I like to think I approach my work as if these were my own children.  I am passionate about what I do and work to hold all of our children to very high standards academically, socially and emotionally, in an effort to ensure that they are competetive once they leave.  I believe that our parents send their very best kids to school each day and it is our job to do whatever it takes to help them learn and mature.  
In terms of the cyberbullying that takes place, I will be the first to acknowledge that it is a problem that we work fearlessly to address.  The fact of the matter is that the past 5 years have seen an explosion of social media outlets and the ethics of online interactions are being established as we speak.  When it comes to addressing the ""virtual"" conduct of our students, we are at a significant disadvantage, dealing with issues that we aren't even aware exist.  Students are not allowed to access social media (facebook, instagram, etc.) here at school, instead they do so outside of school.  While we have a very real responsibility to adress the issues that take place online, our families must share in that responsibility, ensuring that their children understand the responsibility that comes attached to their use of the internet and social media and furthermore, that their interactions are monitored.  
In terms of the PTA, I would love to report that there is more involvement, but I cannot.  The PTA functions independent of the schools administration.  Our parents have amazing responsibilities that include working, caring for other children and/or family members and maintaining their own households.  PTA meetings have not been very well attended, in spite of the fact that our PTA has attempted a variety of strategies to engage families.  The PTA has hosted am and pm meetings, offered food and raffled prizes.  As far as I'm concerned, an active PTA is still very much a priority for our school as a ""family involved gets the problem solved"".  All that being said, my door has always and will remain open for you and anyone else who would like to resolve any issues that arise.  As the leader of this school, I too am learning and will continue to be open and responsive to the feedback offered by any of our stakeholders (children, families and faculty members).   
I opened the doors to this school, for the first time, back in September of 2009 and I am disappointed that any of our families feel the way you do.  I appreciate your feedback and assure you that I will continue to work hard to make sure that other families do not have the same experience that you have had.
Thanks again for your feedback.",0,0,1,2013-07-19T18:13:02,0.75,0.151,0.23199999999999998,0.048,0.37799999999999995,0.133,0.6990000000000001,0.087,0.16899999999999998,0.611,0.13,0.28300000000000003

After reading and exploring this page summarizing what kind of school PAACE is, i found somethings pretty hard to believe and when i say this i mean specifically one thing.  This one thing is the fact that their are some staff in the school that does not trust the Principal and that the staff and administration have ""friction"" between them.  Well to be honest this really isn't true and is coming from people who might have spent about a day or two in the school and gathered this information   Now let someone with quite a lot of experience in this three year old school tell you a little about because that all it takes to realize how great of a school it is.  To start off PAACE means business and unless your willing to moderate learning and having fun, you will not enjoy this school .  You may come into this school as an immature, careless and disrespectful student but i assure you that you will leave having learned at least a bit and having gone through a reality check.  Now you ask how this is possible and where is the proof that is where the staff and administration comes in.  it all begins from the principal.  what can i say about the principal, there are no words to describe the hard work, trust, personality, mind, and last but not least achievements of this man.  all i can say is that they are nothing shorter of amazing.  in just three years Principal Rivera has transformed a dream into a reality, he has turned one of the newest school into a great school and continues on.  Turning this school into a great school required the assistant principal.  She is the Principal's right hand in pretty much everything, walking by his office i always see the two speaking about issues, news and thing to do around the school and the both of them never stop at enough but always go for more than enough.  The guidance counselor, MR.Pardo, is another part of the administration that plays a huge role in students.  he is gentle and very patient with people allowing us kids to trust him along with everyone in the school about our problems.  He is also one of the extraordinary people in this school.  When it came time for the first graduating class to begin the High School Application Process, he learned literally every detail from small to big in order to ensure that we chose the best high school possible that we at the same time will enjoy.  The last part of the staff are the school aide, secretary, and parent coordinator   MRS. Oheler is the school aide and one of the most loved people in the school, she just does so so much for the school that you can't even imagine, she does more than expected and required because she loves helping us kids succeed and is one of the people kids usually trust problems with.  MRS.Arroyo, the school secretary is also a very hardworking women who keeps quiet yet has a big impact on the school from writing everyone check(LOL) to making sure the computers in the whole school are functioning and benefiting all the students.  MR. Conde, the parent coordinator is one of those people who cheers people up when they are down and tries to think like a kid in order to best help them.  MR. mercedes is another part of the administration that basically checks on all the resources and serves as a gym teacher,he also is able to understand kids in a unique way.  this is the overview on the administration. the staff (teachers) are the ones that give students the hard work and the ducation they will need in order to succeed in life.  All these people from administration to staff work hard everyday take a serious commitment to their job and never give up and this is what evry school needs but cannot get.

I would like to see more of the environmental, science and health education incorporated into the curriculum.  What really excited me about this school was the partnering of the grades, science projects and community learning with Einstein but I have yet to see this in action.  I know that having a new school calls for some bumps to be smoothed out, but I do hope since this was the foundation of the school it will be a more active role in the children's education sooner than later.",0,0,0,2012-03-23T17:35:59,1.0,0.071,0.218,0.038,0.64,0.075,0.601,0.067,0.113,0.637,0.17300000000000001,0.147
11X498,cgillig2,bronx,K-8,652,"Thank you, Christine, and thank you, ADC1, for your comments. I believe that, as a principal, one has to know when to be strong and when to be flexible enough to bend down to give those hugs to the elementary students we have and to reach up to give the high fives to the middle school students we have now towering over me. One definitely DOES have to be TOUGH to run a K-8 school successfully in NYC, I'll give you that:)

We have a vision for the school for the first 5 years of our phase-in, and our staff, students and parents are behind us. Input is welcomed and expected, but decisions are made for the good of the ENTIRE school community. I don't expect EVERYONE to agree with all we do...however, we are a choice school...

Decisions are made after considering if they are educationally sound or not, students are expected to behave appropriately and follow rules and receive praise and rewards when they do and fitting consequences when they don't. I don't particularly see that as being hard, but I will defend your right to say it.

As always, the door is open if you'd care to talk about it.

While that school has been nothing but great, its only up to 5th grade and the middle school we are zoned for is less than stellar (putting is nicely). An added bonus is that my younger daughter will be starting kindergarten with you in 2 years and she and her sister will be in the same school!

The school focuses on experiential learning such as story writing, manipulating graphs, and working in small groups.  The school uses Singapore Math and Foundations for the reading curriculum.  Kindergarden has 5 levels of reading and math for children so they can learn at their own pace with their learning peers.  My son's three teachers (homeroom, math, and reading) are all accessible and remind me constantly that I can always come to them with questions and concerns and they want to work with me in my son's education.  

For example, his homeroom teacher talked to me about him not wanting to go to lunch anymore and asked if I knew what the issue was.  I didn't, but asked him.  He explained that he can't focus on lunch because he talks with his friends.  I spoke to his teacher and she suggested he get moved to a smaller lunch table.  He was, and now he's happy to go to lunch again.

They talk back, don't follow instructions, and are defiant when it comes to discipline. Everyday there is a fight. What's sad about it is that often this attitude is a reflection of their home life. Also, if there is a problem, the teachers and staff don't follow the procedures. A kid choked my child in the hallway.  I filed a complaint and i had to keep calling to make sure they were on top of it. In the end that kid is still in school and the school's only response is they're working with that kid and she's going through a lot of problems. My children have to defend themselves on a daily basis because kids want to hit and cause trouble. When I  complained  to the teachers, no one wants to resolve the issue. They keep passing it to the next person. They really don't have the best interests at heart and their jobs are just a paycheck. This school has too many issues.

12X067,Guest,bronx,Elementary,444,"Does Insideschools.org use a different set of standards for reviewing schools? There must be given, given the glowing report they have C.S. 67. My husband and I moved back to New York to care for my elderly father, and we had no choice but to enroll our daughter in the zoned school, C.S. 67. Growing up, my parents sent me to the local Catholic school because C.S. 67 was so bad, and that was more than 20 years ago! Unfortunately, the Catholic school is just as bad as the public school. 

My child started mid-way through kindergarten and has now been there for a year and a half. Both the kindergarten teacher and the 1st grade teacher have told me to take my child out and put her in a better school. Unfortunately it seems if you just spend 15 minutes a day reading to your child and helping them with their homework, they are classroom ""superstars."" I want my daughter to be challenged and to be able to get into Bronx High School of Science or Stuyvesant. If she continues to go here, she will never be able to attend those schools. 

The teachers seem overwhelmed. I took off of work one day to volunteer in the classroom, and my heart goes out to the students and teachers. It seems like the ""problem"" children take over, and all of the teacher's attention is spent dealing with behavior problems. The other kids are just left to fend for themselves. The school itself looks like it is falling down and should be a hazard zone. Many of the teachers buy their own supplies because the school doesn't provide any. 

I find the Principal ghetto, for lack of a better word. She actually said ""On yesterday"" to me! And this is the woman who is supposed to be in charge of my daughter's education?!! OMG! If we lived on the Upper East Side would this even be tolerated? No! It sucks that because we live in a poor area, we have to deal with schools, principals, and teachers who wouldn't last one day in rich neighborhoods. I have loved my daughter's teachers, but I know other parents who dislike their children's teachers. It seems really hit or miss and there doesn't seem to be any support for them. I did talk with one AP, and she was nice. She seemed to care, but she also seemed overwhelmed.

We're moving upstate this summer and enrolling our daughter in the local school up there. As much as it is great to inherit a house that is all paid for in NYC, I can't sacrifice my daughter's education. What chance will she have if we stay?

12X067,Guest,bronx,Elementary,444,Thanks for your life story and your opinion but how is this helping the students? I had my daughter go there and she was a valedictorian and is doing great in High School. Stop blaming the school system and the teachers who are doing AMAZING jobs considering they have low salaries for the best job which is TEACHING. BTW they do provide extra help after-school for students applying for the specialized high schools. So before you go on your rant and rave about FREE public education how about you use the energy you put on here and spend time getting your 5 or 6 year old prepare for High School :) ,3,0,1,2011-10-07T18:57:53,0.75,0.133,0.243,0.081,0.295,0.255,0.894,0.002,0.24100000000000002,0.736,0.006999999999999999,0.439

Seek and ye shall find. 

I wonder what her impressions would be if she came in looking for how the school could help her daughter and how she, as the parent, could orchestrate her daughter's educational trajectory through the school/school system and its resources. I'm sure she would have found ways that people organize to help students and families, not how they are held back.

12X067,Anonymous,bronx,Elementary,444,C.S.67 Is a good school the only thing it needs improvement is on more activities for the children. The Parents Association in the school does not associate themselves with the teachers to make the school better instead they deny help to many parents who really need the help. Many rumors has been heard on how the P.A. in C.S.67 create fundraisers for their own benefits and their pockets. Is that true? Parents have complained on how they have been denied assistance due to the reason that have or have never attended any meetings. Is that true also? I think the Principle should really investigate what kind of volunteers are in her school and what kind of example they are setting for the children.,3,0,0,2010-12-15T06:31:06,0.75,0.133,0.243,0.081,0.295,0.255,0.894,0.002,0.24100000000000002,0.736,0.006999999999999999,0.439
