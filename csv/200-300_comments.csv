07X551,BAL Family Member,bronx,Middle,251,"I could go on and on about Bronx Letters, but instead will do my best to keep it short: this is a magical place. It isn't perfect (is anything?) but what is important is that it's trying to be. I have been a part of the community for many years and can attest that it has done nothing but improve year after year. A comment further below stated the changes that they disagree with - I can absolutely say that they are a disgruntled person making waves, because all of those changes were 100% for the better, or at the very least necessary. 

The learning happening in classrooms here isn't just about gathering information, it's about learning where we stand in the world. Every class pushes students to think about what is happening right now in our world, and what sort of impact it has on them and they can have on it. Students and teachers work alongside each other to better understand what is going on, rather than teachers acting like they are all-knowing gifts to the class. There are opportunities for students to push one another, to better work with their community, to design the kind of learning and activities that they care about. But Letters is much more than a school, because the people within it care about more than just curriculum - they care about kids. To hear both students and teachers say that the community feels like a family is a normal occurrence, and every student has adults that they are close with. As each year passes more and more 8th graders choose to stay for four more years, and alumni are seen visiting on a regular basis. 

It's hard to keep this any shorter, because there is literally that much to say about the school and the people within it. There are plenty of amazing schools in NYC, but none like Bronx Letters - because it isn't just a school, it's a home.",0,0,0,2018-08-01T22:31:35,0.75,0.159,0.299,0.127,0.915,0.263,0.932,0.0,0.359,0.598,0.027999999999999997,0.41100000000000003

The school is great and I've been here since middle school so I can tell you how much the staff cares about this school and how hard the principal and assistant principals work to make sure we are getting what we need. The rules are annoying sometimes but they are all pretty normal stuff like uniforms, passes, lateness, attendance, and all that stuff. The deans go hard for the school and yes, sometimes it is really annoying but that's why our results keep going up! The school has changed a lot over the last few years and change is hard. But there is no question if this is a great school and if the staff here cares about us. These are people who call me to wake up for school. These are people who come to your house if you are missing days. I get that some people want a more chill environment but as a student, I prefer a place with high standards that will prepare me for college. This is that school. The staff is fire.

07X551,BAL Ravens,bronx,Middle,251,"You know you are at an amazing school when all you can think about is going back to the community during the summer time. I started at BAL just as any first-year teacher starts, timid and in need of support. However, I quickly realized the sort of space I was in and the people I was surrounded by. I found myself working with a team of teachers who were ready and able to help me reflect on my craft (lesson planning, procedures, etc.) while helping me understand how to build relationships with the students. The student-teacher relationships I was able to develop were even further supported by an administration, who worked daily to analyze the culture and ensure the entire community had space to comfortably learn and work..... and this was only the first year. The principal and other leaders are constantly reflecting on the school every year (with heavy input from students and staff) and seamlessly builds supports where they are needed. They have brought on more administrators to support teachers, more counselors to help support students emotionally, more special education teachers to help ensure all students get the education they deserve and more leadership roles for students to ensure they have a strong voice. The two greatest gains have been made in the restorative justice program (half the rate of other NYC schools,) and the thriving sports program (city champs in softball!) All of this (and more) have made this school become a true home to everyone who walks in the doors. Yes, we do face the same challenges as many other schools, but I can confidently stand up to them with the support of absolutely everyone around me on a foundation built by people who care.",0,0,0,2018-07-14T02:24:18,0.75,0.159,0.299,0.127,0.915,0.263,0.932,0.0,0.359,0.598,0.027999999999999997,0.41100000000000003
07X551,BAL Teacher,bronx,Middle,251,"The Principal is amazing!! he is very helpful when it comes to anything that would better the school and kids. He ensures that restorative justice practices are applied in all we do. I am currently a teacher at BAL and can honestly say it is he best school I have worked at. The scholars best interest are always put first and the staff always comes together to make sure we are providing them with the best opportunities possible. Our scholars are exposed to colleges from grade 6 and have over night and day trips to different colleges throughout the school year. They are taught how to use their voices to make sure they make changes in their communities. Our scholars have gone to DC to states their opinions and have gone to places such as facebook headquarters to attempt to block videos of people fighting. They have taken a stand in so many issues that our nation is going through such as day of silence for those whom don't have a voice and the nationwide walk out that was organized by our own students. 

I have never been at a school in which observations are actually a positive experience. Every de-brief is filled with amazing feed back and actual attainable next steps that the Principal Brandon Cardet and the 2 AP's Erin and Amy give you things they have used when they where teachers to help you out. They will also take the time to plan with you if you need help and are the teachers biggest cheerleaders in the classroom. I actually looked forward to my observations because I knew I was going to learn something new in de-brief. They also encourage teachers to apply to leadership positions throughout the school and even if you don't have experience they help you. 

They are also amazing with first year teachers. hey encourage first year teachers and give them the best guidance ever. I never had this guidance when I was a first year teacher so I asked to be put on so I could experience it and I loved it. They give you extra observations and don't expect you to know it all as other schools would. They build you up in the best way and help you find your groove. 

The Principal and the support staff are always out in the hallways during transition and can be seen giving students pep talks when they need it, intervening in issues long before they get out of hand, and implementing rules and regulations of the school in the most honest way. The school has a counselor for every grade which is amazing as the counselors know every student personally. The counselors are committed to make sure the students stay on the right path and when students don't show up do home visits to attempt to figure out the problem. 

The school is a big fighter to get more money for sports in lower income segregated communities like ours. Our students have gone and spoken at many different places to present this case and state how important it is for schools in segregated communities to have access to sports programs. Our female softball team came out number 1 in the city championships this year and this shows how dedicated they where and the staff was to helping them go above and beyond. 

The principal has an open door policy, when he is in his office, and students and staff feel free to always be able to walk in and talk to him if they have an issue. The principal is very transparent to what expectations are for both students and staff and has many ways to help you maintain expectations. 

Every year the school host a benefit to help raise money for events and trips that the DOE doesn't provide funding for such as over night college trips outside of the state. In which students stay in hotels while they tour colleges. Our school also has an exchange program in which our students go for one week to another state to stay at a participating students home and go to school with them. Then the following year that students comes to the bronx and attends BAL. 

The staff is mixed with different cultures and ages of people whom have the best interest of the students in mind always. They students can be seen asking for hugs and asking staff to help them with personal issues since they feel such a strong connection with us. We are def one big family. 

One amazing difference at this school is that they understand that you are human and have families. When I had to leave when my son got sick in school, I found that I was giving smiles by the administration to go and take care of him instead of mean stares. 

One of the AP's, Erin Garry, even set up an additional English regents prep course at the end of the year in which I had the privilege to help her teach. She would still do her AP job but also would lesson plan for over a month to make sure our students were getting additional help. 

Brandon is big on us also looking at ourselves and doing work on ourselves that don't have to do with teaching. During our PD's we did cultural work to notice our own biases and experiences with discrimination and racism so that we may better serve our students. We as a staff were able to bond and get to know each other as more than just co-workers but as individuals. This gave us an upper hand since we were able to tackle issues together instead of separately. 

I would recommend this school to anyone. It is lots of work since you are always working on yourself and your students but it is an amazing experience. I have grown as a teacher more in this school that all my years of teaching combined.",0,0,0,2018-07-13T01:06:20,0.75,0.159,0.299,0.127,0.915,0.263,0.932,0.0,0.359,0.598,0.027999999999999997,0.41100000000000003

He relies on the head of school culture, a dean, Mr. David Rosen-Garcia, to run the school and it’s become more like Rikers than using restorative practices to promote social justice. This is evident in the suspension rates, which consistently lead the Urban Assembly. 

Cardet-Hernandez has forced out incredible counselors, teachers and support staff for personal reasons, regardless of their work and dedication to the school and community. Any staff that consistently put the interest of the kids first - Ms. Dash, Ms. Chapman, Ms. A, Mr. Rekoert - were either fired or
told to leave. They’re no longer there. Neither are the most unifying aspects of the BAL community - Advisory, Houses, Founders Day, the Applegate Garden, Field Day, the Annual Thanksgiving Feast...

This quote eventually adorned our very own library. The Bronx Academy of Letters sounds like an incredible place and believe me it was. The founding principal was a powerful force and we all worked our tails off to meet her expectations. 


This very many years later I feel I am stuck in another extreme of Poe's writing. I'm left scratching my head, thinking ""words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality."" (Poe, again) And in many ways I am silent, speechless, going with the flow, trying to keep my head above water, while trying to fly below the radar. I don't know who will hear (or read) my words or if they will see the light of day.

Pricipal was able to become Principal when Mrs Rivera retired to me it was extremely important that the school remained in the hands of someone who already knew the ins and outs of what was going on.  Though many parents (who have complained to me) do not find Ms. Maresca approachable i must say this I felt this way at one point but i addressed my concerns to her in the proper manner and she will respond appropriately but will not hesitate to tell it like it is she's really a no nonsense  individual and isn't shy to tell you the truth and set up straight she's too concerned with educating our kids to waste time on childish behavior from parents.  Unlike the parents that have said that faculty brushes off bad behavior i MUST disagree last year my daughter had a bully that was just so frustrating she didn't want to go to school anyone the first time the children were spoken to and parents addressed as the bullying continued she immediately with the school counselor set up a meeting with my husband and i, the other parent and the children the BULLYING was put to a STOP!!!!  SHE HAS A STRONG NO BULLYING POLICY.  Parents need to know how to approach these situations in a manner they themselves will like to be treated.  
Ms Maresca has truly done much work to make this school an A++ both educationally as well as physically.  It is almost looks like a small suburb school and the saturday classes are a plus.  My friends in the suburbs complain that they don't have that.  I can also say WOO HOO my daughter is getting cursive classes which NO SCHOOL in this are has i was teaching her at home because it was announced on the news that cursive was no longer a must in schools. My husband and i are selling our house to move to the suburbs because of the middle schools and do not want to pay catholic school been there done that with my oldest and trust me not any better but because this school is great i can hold off til she graduates.
So with every PRO there is a CON.  The Parents Association needs MUCH WORK!! we have the same people running it year after year and i don't see any one benefitting but the kindergarten and senior classes as well as themselves.  they are not approachable to new help though they claim they need help and in my opinion MY OPINION we need a huge change.  HUGE there alot of $$ going into PA but not all grade benefit from it leaving me to wonder hmmmmm!!!!!!  ",0,0,0,2011-09-21T11:48:50,1.0,0.138,0.213,0.07,0.9059999999999999,0.12300000000000001,0.7340000000000001,0.254,0.09300000000000001,0.597,0.034,0.23800000000000002

Teachers use smart boards, students have access to laptops in some classes. Students travel to their classes and are required to carry their book bags around as there are no lockers. The idea of interactive notebooks should be in place to keep relevant notes available to all students instead of a bunch of handouts that typically get misplaced in multiple folders. Discipline is taken care of by the AP, the dean and rarely have heard anything serious to be concerned about.  Curriculum is challenging but appropriate. Their communication is very good and use apps for easier and fast communication. There is opportunity for extracurricular activities after school. Supposedly they have a track team that my son was interested in joining last year but never heard anything about it. School puts on an incredible musical theater show in May where interested students have the opportunity to audition, rehearse and perform.

08X101,Person,bronx,Middle,545,"I am an eigth grader at the moment in ms 101. obviously, the school has undergone so many changes in the past two years. just to say, the principal is doing an amazing job involving the school in many artnerships and sticking to a stricter more acedemical side. now, we have a stricter uniform policy but i believe that it is better to wear uniform rather than to struggle to find the perfect outfit everyday and clean clthes and all differently just to not getvpicked on. sorry for my spelling errors. however, there are so many programs and cluns going on that i was not aware, it is a good yet bad thig. the school is very disorganized however, a new guidance counselor has been hired yet i've never really noticed her. our previous guidance counselor was always around when you needed it. that is another thing. this school seems like you cant do anthing about the issue. the principal is always occupied so if you have a complaint all the teachers and staff will appoint you to him. but he wuld never have time to adress the matter. i think that s  big flaw. over all the disorgnization and not knowing of whats going on(not to mention we got our specialized high school test tickets last minute) its a good school. the education system alone is amazing. however, i will say, if you are not in gifted and talented, please stay focused because there is a fine line between those barriers. although this sounds wrong, its the truth, i've noticed g and t is more mature and responsible than the other students. you can still do amzing in the other classes but in g and t, you actually have more oppurtunites when it cmes to taing regen ts. you get more done. the other classes are still incredibly smart but if you want to accomplish or challenge yourself more, g and t is the way to go! i wish all fifth graders good luck. ad again, sorry for all errors in spelling and conventions.",0,0,0,2015-03-05T03:02:36,0.75,0.013000000000000001,0.233,0.053,0.669,0.059000000000000004,0.48100000000000004,0.156,0.099,0.5710000000000001,0.156,0.132
08X101,Student,bronx,Middle,545,"Just to start off, 101 is an amazing school. The classes are very rigorous especially for gifted and talented students such as my self. We are offered a variety of regents such as earth science, integrated algebra, English language arts, and Spanish proficiency. The atmosphere of the school is warm and welcoming. The teachers are all amazing. They care about our present academics and our future. In addition to their awesomeness, the teachers make learning fun. They are all strict and get the job done, you will definitely learn here. In addition to our academics we have an immense amount of extra curricular activities including boys and girls basketball, dance, art, music, band, drama, yearbook, history club, track, and many test preps if needed. 23 of our graduating students including my self got into specialized highschools. 101 has a spectacular music program and the music teacher is the best teacher there. She has done many things for her students and her life is really devoted to us. We've performed in all the boroughs except for Staten Island and she has recently fundraised 3000 dollars for the program. Yes, one math teacher gets criticized a lot but she is an amazing teacher. She expects highly of her students and only wishes the best for them. She may seem intimidating and very strict but over all you may not like her but you would be lucky to get her. Our new principal Mr. Rosoff has really turned the school for the best and knows everyone by name. He is really doing a fantastic job. 101 has rally prepared me for highschool, college, and the future with its amazing staff and academics.

My daughter is excelling academically and socially. She attends weekly test preparation for the Specialized High School examination, as well as the Social Studies club. She is enthusiastic about showing school spirit by attending all at-home basketball games, volunteering whenever possible, and engaging in all available activities. 



Mr. Rosoff welcomes parents to monthly breakfasts in which information is disseminated, personal questions are answered, and connections are made with parents. He personally answers all email within an hour of receipt, which, I find amazing. Mr. Rosoff's leadership style is endearing, positive, and attentive.

I remember entering the school eager to be apart of the Gifted and Talented program. Now, the program has been completely removed and there is no longer a rigorous program. The teachers here at M.S 101 barely care about your academic future. In my opinion, they do not provide the students with a helpful and understanding ambiance. There are very few clubs present in this school which is another downside.

08X101,Mariah001,bronx,Middle,545,"Ms.101 is a great school. If you are considering this school, I recommend it. Our school is small but friendly. Almost everyone knows everyone, and if you don't know anyone, you can try out for after school programs, Dance team, Cheerleading, Basketball (Boys and Girls) . I recommend this school because not only will you find many clubs or programs that interest you, you also have a lot of people backing you up. 

If you are wondering about teachers, they are tough but fair. They will push you to do your best, but if they didn't you wouldn't get anywhere. As for the Principals (3 of them), They are all nice and welcoming. I'm not going to lie, they are strict when it comes to uniform and class work, but they only mean best, and if you need someone to talk to, they are welcoming and always behind you. 

This is my last year in Ms.101 and I love my teachers and my classes. I'll miss everyone, but I'm ready to move foward in my life and my school is very supporting of that. Many students may complain about the work, or the teachers, but I think in the end, almost everyone will miss our small school, and funny, down to earth teachers. If you're a parent or a student, I think this school is a wonderful.

08X101,I'll miss the school terribly.,bronx,Middle,545,"I'm in the graduating class of 2012 and M.S.101 is the BEST. Teachers come to work everyday willing and fully prepared to enlighten students, the school maintains a comfortable and neat order, and very rarely will a fight occur. (It'd probably be a ""she said, he said"".) Class sizes vary depending on whether you are or are not in the Gifted and Talented program. We share the school with two others but it feels as the the entire school is ours considering we are allowed on the floors for the other schools. We have a large library run by a previous 6th grade social studies teacher who expands the array of books available each month. Also, the gym (on the first floor,) is very large. There are two gym teachers, both very dedicated and always making gym entertaining and active even for those who aren't. (Believe I was one and I ended up loving gym.) I took Spanish for three years,( this is my third) and I know a majority of the language due to the teacher and her goals set. When days are warm, gym is held outside and if requested, so is class, under s tree. There are AC's in each room, which work, and there are computer (three) in each room assisted by one of the two laptop carts that travel 'round from class to class when desired. S.S. Teachers show films ad actual evidence from scenes and war fronts very often. And math teachers aid students who need help. There is extended moning for students who want to catch up after missing a day, or do not fully understand the work. Many teachers take time out if their busy schedules and stay after school, (as long as it takes,) until the child understands. The principal, (Mrs. Hewitt, is a very joyous spirit, conducting weekly check ups on teachers and students to maintain order. There is so much more, so many other good things, and you'd be crazy not to send your child here.

Mr. Rossoff only cares about the dress code more then the students well being.  My mom is trying to get me into the g&t program but I don’t seem the point. Kids in g&t are totally failing and they have done nothing about it. They do have a  favoritism over most students but we are forced that way because we hate the cariculim ancho was they treat us. My grade dropped 9 points because I was Absent. Meanwhile they’re are kids in g&t with a 30 overall average. This makes no sense to me. I really am considering  transferring out of this school.

I always looked out for them. Yes, it did get kind of boring, but if you have friends and you behave well, you will end up have a great time. I made friends with almost all my teachers. Trust me it pays off to be able to talk to teachers. They are very cool. If you are able to talk to them then when its time to ask for help or anything it wont be hard AT ALL and i am one shy person!!! Projects arent such a big del unless you procrastinate. And the uniform is so good compared to other schools especially hs ( i know this because my highschool now requires grey skirts button down shirts and blazers) in 101 you can wear any type of khaki or navy blue and any polo plain shirt. and if you want navyblue sweats too. This school has also prepared me so well for high school. I am now in ALL honors class. 101 is truly amazing and i will love and miss it forever <3

08X131,Soapbox Sarah,bronx,Middle,479,"IS 131 is a terrible school at best. The students have no respect for teachers or administration, there are multiple fights every day, and children are constantly wandering the halls cutting class. Bullying is a very prevalent thing at this school despite all of the anti-bullying posters hanging around the building. Students frequently use inappropriate language in class and in the halls, disrupt class, come to class unprepared, and feel that they can do whatever they want whenever they want. 131's motto of being ""prepared, punctual, and polite"" is an empty alliteration as most students are never prepared or polite. However, they do show up to class on time, for the most part, unless they are part of the ""Hallwalkers."" The school has no Dean, and no form of consequences for student misbehavior other than calling their parents.

The principal is well aware of the disciplinary problems at the school but chooses to blame teachers for poor classroom management. The principal has little control over the students so she exerts her power over the teachers and other staff in abusive and bullying ways. Some teachers are favored while others are bullied with no rhyme or reason as to why. The easiest way to survive at 131 and maintain your sanity (and job) is to remain under the radar. It is a toxic environment was extremely low morale.

She rules and runs under intimidation.  She intimidates the faculty and students at 131. Her intimidation only works on the teachers.  The students run the school.  There are no consequences for students, only teachers.  Her mouth is disgusting.  She curses during staff meetings and she curses at the students.  She gets away with murder in 131 and the school is a hole in the wall. TOXIC is a word all too familiar with those at 131.  The environment is toxic.

08X131,LouJay,bronx,Middle,479,"Dear Soapbox Sarah;
I am disgusted by the comments you make here.  Your animosity against the school is very unprofessional.  I am a Parent Association Executive Board member who is at the school from 8:00am to 5:30pm everyday volunteeting.  I have yet to see or hear about some of the accusations you make here.  Tell me something!;  which institution have you worked on that doesn't have one or two bad apples?  When you do find it, please let me know because I want to go work for them.  Respect is something that is given to others in order to be received back and Authority is taught in order to obtain control of your work environment.  In a Title I school we should expect to find students that are often unprepared.  It is our responsibilities as teachers, administrators & Parents Associations to find help and/or provide for these students.  When as a teacher, you don't make it your business to find out why these children are not prepared, then that only says one thing to me & that is; that you are just an employee & not a teacher.  In many cases, families may not have the means to provide their children with the supplies, uniforms, etc.  The school's Parent Association is willing to help.  The Principal is a very well respected individual by students, parents and all.  If she blames a teacher for lack of discipline in their classrooms is because she has the necessary proof to back her decisions.  No discipline in the classrooms is due to lack of teachers authority, which translate to no instructional time for our children.  So,  we that said; I am personally grateful  that our Principal chooses instruction over instructors that are obviously only looking at the clock to go out to eat or to go home.

I am not sure where you volunteer but it is clearly NOT on the 2nd floor where the shenanigans happens. Your volunteering must be limited to selling snacks in front of the cafeteria or handing out hot dogs to the teachers because I have ZERO clue who you are. Maybe instead of selling snacks you should start selling pencils. These kids come in wearing Jordans, texting on their iphones, and having in depth conversations about their PS4s but never have a pencil. You give them a pencil 1st period and by 3rd they are asking for another one. If you are so concerned with finding out why these kids have expensive sneakers, phones, and video games instead of pencils perhaps you should do that during the 9.5hrs a day every day.

Mr. Nevers (AP) was the greatest host and made me and the other substitutes feel like we were part of the team! He spent 15-20 minutes giving us a tour and placing us in classes that we were qualified to teach. I believe he was also trying to place us in the least stressful situations. I think he understood and CARED that we were coming in to unfamiliar surroundings and didn't want us to be overwhelmed trying to balance behavior issues, routines, schedules and teaching. It was a smart move on his part because the substitutes will want to keep coming back which provides the students consistency & saves him the trouble of trying to find coverage everytime a teacher is out as well as the trouble of always having to show substitutes around in the morning. I know a lot of principals or assistant principals don't even handle placing the subs. They allow the secretaries to place them. It makes no sense.

They want all our kids to succeed but they aren’t going to pass them to just pass them. If you had to place your child in a charter school the expectations would be similar if not more... Be honest with your self, blame your lack of commitment to your child and your fear of them being uncomfortable with being challenged and expected to do more. As for the above comment you are your child’s first teacher being a parent is more than clothing and feeding them. FYI- Science is two parts: lab work and content he/she may have done well in the lab work which with overshadowed the content so they averaged out to a 3. Mean while in the other two subjects on average they are a 2 because they 3 items graded regarding math and ELA were mostly below average (level 2).

08X333,Johnny,bronx,Elementary,578,"Thank you ""Lizzy"" for your perspective. It is rather informative, yet also somewhat misleading. A school is as strong as its people who work in it and support its vitality and needed improvement. The school community has the capacity to either improve or bring a school down. First of all, sometimes change is good. Some people left the school this last school year (the percentage was actually smaller than described- 6 out of 70) for various reasons, which happens each year in many schools. People seek schools closer due to moving, people get promoted, or fail to see things from different viewpoints. You're right, communication in the school can be better. But it is important to remember that communication works both ways. While communication (primarily gossip, which is hard to control outside of the school) has been previously posed as ""the issue"" and the scapegoat for the true issue-the need for significant progress with respect to student achievement, it is important to note that the school has made progress in different ways and will continue to improve if there is a UNITED front and a decreased number of professionals putting the school down, rather than improving it. It is a fact (data doesn't lie)that the school has made gains as it relates to achievement in ELA & Math this school year with many English Language Learners testing out on the NYESLAT and scoring level 3 and 4 on state tests. Let's focus on highlighting what should change and how to fix the perceived problem(s), but what the school does well. Every school has its problems. No school is perfect, and people will inevitably always find something to gripe or complain about. Rather than offering a diatribe please answer this question for the community: What specific, viable solutions do you recommend for improving the perceived ""disfunctions"" of the administration and ""issues""?  Let's be a part of the solution, not the problem.",0,0,0,2011-09-03T22:06:10,0.75,0.23,0.341,0.209,0.621,0.324,0.877,0.005,0.201,0.76,0.027999999999999997,0.428

I can go on forever. This school WANTS to be great, but the majority of the children are stopping them. This school is anything but united.

My name is Patricia Blackwell,
My son was one of the first 6 graders entering Soundview.
We meet Mr. Frack before school opened. We were able to listen to what he
expected from the children and us as parents. This was a new school and I knew
it was going to take time to mold it. Every year got better, and better. Mr.
Frack tried his best to pick teachers who were excited to teach and who wanted
to do their job and educate our children no matter what type of background they
came from, or nationality. He had his hand in every aspect of the school from
teachers, after school programs, art programs, sports. He wanted the school to
be well rounded in every way.


My child entered this school as a shy child, and very quite.
The mentor program is the best I have ever seen. They instilled in him to
strive for higher grades, to express himself, and to be out going. They turned
my son into a young man. When he left Sound view he was on honor roll. Also, he
is looking forward to go to college. They deal with our children on an
educational level, and on a personal level.


My child was very safe at this school. They do not tolerate
fighting, or bullying.


This school took the student on trips to colleges, theaters,
etc.


Your child will look at this school as a second home. I hope

Everyone has been approachable and informative.  From my first day at Soundview, teachers and administrators have welcomed me into their team and have served as guide and support, extending from being prepared to assisting with classroom management. Each day that I have substituted, there has been a thorough lesson plan ready for me.  This is admirable on the behalf of the teachers at Soundview because it displays not only professionalism but a care for their scholars. Mr. Frackelton (The Principal), is a great Team Leader who leads by example and shows commitment; by walking the hallways along with the scholars while inquiring about how they are doing and building an administrative team that is strong.  It is an honor for me to be of service at Soundview Academy.

Thanks for your post.  Yes, our first years were rockier but Rome is not built in a day.  We are now one of the strongest middle schools in the area and the only Dual Language program in the entire district.

You forgot to tell them, however, that you have earlier days to compensate for the long days. With the new demands on you guys from the Common Core Learning Standards you'll be glad, however, we pushed you as much as we did.  You'll thank us when you get to high school!

Sometimes I sit and wonder what the ""GOOD"" schools are NOT reporting, what are they hiding?

I can guarantee that I can sit into any one of my child's classrooms and see what she is learning.  Yeah its a school within a school and the staff is young but they are all easily accessible. if i have a questions it gets answered.  They hammerdown on bullying especially cyberbullying.

08X448,William Frackelton,bronx,Middle,392,"Thanks for the reply.  When we came into the community we did not accept the prevailing wisdom that bullying is normal.  We went strictly by the Chancellor's Regulations and we reported what took place, followed by strong interventions and follow up.  Now we have one of the safest middle schools in the area and a grade of a B.  As I say, safety trumps everything.  So, things are not always as simple as they may appear.  Come up and see the school anytime to see for yourself how serious we are about our scholars' safety and the school environment.

The truth is this school does not do right by children and the staff.  We're supposed to pretend everything is ok, our principal is right a hundred percent of the time, and the children are perfect.  That is not the case.  PS 42 is a dysfunctional school because of it's leadership and the teachers who don't stand by the rights of the children.  There are many incidents swept under the rug, not documented, and/or ignored.  Children are being bullied in the class and especially at lunch.  It pains me because my father attended this school, I did, and now my daughter and it is a school with low expectations.  My daughter had glue poured on her uniform pants.  When I attempted to speak to the counselor, she was busy.  I spoke with Ms. Orduz, the principal, during dismissal and was told the matter would be resolved.  My daughter the next day complained that the student had attacked another one of my daughters peers without consequence.  I on my own reached out to the parent and was shocked to find out that she did not know about the incidents.  The mother was pleasant and heard me out but she also wondered why the school had not informed her.  When I dropped off my daughter the next day I let Ms. Velencia know I had spoken with the parent and told her that the parent did not know.  I asked why was the parent not informed and her response was, ""We're busy planning trips.""

Again I was assured the issue would be addressed.  Then a couple of weeks later my child was punched in his back during lunch time.  I asked my child who was watching the class, he stated that no one was watching the class because the assistant principal was showing the lady that was supposed to watching the class something on her cellphone.

I again spoke with Ms. Solis about the lack of supervision for both children and adults.  Ms. Solis went on a long tangent about how Ms. Orduz rewards children, there are all these wonderful trips, Ms. Orduz cares.  What does that have to do with my concerns.  I'm worried about my child.

It is difficult to have a legit conversation with the principal about student progress because she tries to win you over by being nice.  The assistant principal is clueless.  It's very accurate that if you attend a low preforming elementary school you will most likely end up in a low preforming middle school.  Where does that lead, to a low preforming high school.  I have nothing against the principal but she comes off as delusional when you attempt to speak to her about real topics.  You can't make any suggestions because she has all the answers and is very defensive.  Various teachers, not just my daughter's teacher,  have shared with me how frustrated they are with the lack of support and  chaos at the school.  Ms. Orduz needs help in organizing her priorities or the school will continue to fail.  Look at the data it speaks for itself.  See how many people think it could be better.

The teachers were loving, caring, parents to all of the students. The principal back then was Mr. Ortiz. He was nice. My best teacher was Betty  Rosa and Ms. Moreno. I truly love them. They guide me and help me. This school will always be in my heart  because at a time of need in my family this school community step up to the plate and support my family. My brother died and my family did not have money for funeral expences nd the school and community help out. This school is the best. I wish I could do more for this school. Today I am a teacher and I hope one day to go back and deliver  what was deliver to me love.

Why are parents not being held accountable for allowing their children to behave in such an atrocious manner? The parents at the school should stop deifying the streetlife/thug/gangster/bad girl way of being and put more energy into raising responsible citizens.  Most of these kids would have a culture shock if they were placed in a school where the parents promoted different values. BTW there is another school that shares space with 55 and the parents have their kids act in a responsible manner and it permeates that school's culture.  Same building, same community, different parents. The neighborhood is DANGEROUS and that is why you should not send your kids to the school.

09X055,Dedicated mother,bronx,Elementary,518,"I did not bash the educators. i know that some of the teachers are trying their hardest. My sons teacher now and those in the past are great teachers, however the school lacks organization and safety.  I simply stated facts. and i do agree with you that the problems underlines at home with parents not teaching their children how to behave, but as teachers  it shouldn't just be about teaching their students curriculum, but also about responsibility. Teachers can really have an influence on children. i've seen that first hand.  I see how some parents talk to their children and the way they themselves behave with them and i admit it truly disgusts me! i assure you my son is raised as a respectful innocent 6 year old.  I never said the prinicpal should be a superman either. instead of getting offended as a educator, read my comment again. also as teachers you are with the children the the majority of their day so yeah, i believe that teachers should try to act not only as educators but diciplinaries, if the issue escalates, well thats what the security guards are there for. I  wish there were enough parents who cared to take this issue to the Board of Education and demand security for their children. but as you stated in different words, there aren't.

09X109,Michael Garcia,bronx,Elementary,564,"This was my Elementary school. I'm now 24. 

Part of my great childhood is in this school.  The staff were great.  This school opened my eyes to the unlimited possibilities a person can have.  The staff really helped me realize that there was a big world out there for me to discover.  

I love a lot of the staff that was there.  Especially Ms. Schweitzer, who I believe is retired now.  They were my friends and people that I could turn to... at age 7.

If you child goes here, I think they will get adequate attention.  But it starts with YOU! Be involved in the school. It is YOUR school too.  It is a community.  PLEASE don't take this as an okay to be in constant communication with your childs teachers.  If you do, your child will not like you for it. Be yourself and grow with the school. Take a day to volunteer at some school function at the school.  Express your concerns to the parent coordinator and the principal of the school.  Please, do not overshadow your kids!! I am primarily speaking to the single child parents who are raising their child by themselves. Your child will not develop to be a strong willed, self-aware being if you are always there.  Children are um.... kids but sometimes they can be the most clearest zen-like little adults and you do not want to hinder their development by protecting them from everything. (taking a breath)

It is nice that the school is away from major avenues.  The school sits at one of the highest points in the Bronx. In my book, places in the highest points of any terrain is the best place to be (and if I'm not mistaken, through out history, the rulers, educators, nobles and wealthiest people lived at high terrains).

The school is small but it has space for everything.  It has two yards (wow I had a lot of fun there) a Gym, computer rooms, Auditorium, Cafeteria and library.  I always remember the building being very clean.  I've been to some schools that were not as clean.  The building has a layout that I've always liked.  

After school was great.  DODGEBALL!!!! The first time I publicaly danced was in that school!!!! Amazing.  Wow, I am turning 7 as I write this.

This is a good school.  Tell your kids to get A's only.  There is help and support for them to do so AT ANY school.  Tell your kids to ask the principal for anything.

I just have to say that from the moment I walked in this school to provide a training for teachers from this school and schools in their network, the experience was phenomenal.  Perhaps it's time for an updated review, because I saw nothing smelly or unwelcoming, in fact it was just the opposite. Perhaps most importantly, every member of the staff from teachers to administrators were invested in learning together, and it's clear that they go above and beyond to create an environment conducive to learning for all participants in their network.  The common spaces held evidence of both student learning and adult learning. Granted, it's hard to know everything about any community on a quick visit, but the experience I had in this school was impressive and deserves to be noted. Kudos to Principal Olivia Francis-Webber and recognition must go to the multimedia specialist, Arc Handwerger, for maintaining a phenomenal learning space for kids and adults alike. ",0,0,0,2012-10-14T04:27:19,0.5,0.311,0.225,0.10099999999999999,0.484,0.371,0.883,0.035,0.217,0.706,0.031,0.35200000000000004

Graduating from Mott Hall 3 and going into high school I was one step ahead all my classmates. I was comfortable giving presentations, I had strong public speaking skills and knew how to network and dress for success. Mott Hall 3 has been nothing but successful in preparing me for what life really is like after graduating middle school, high school and college.

The poems are the work of Sydell Rosenberg, a former public school teacher, ESL teacher and founding member of the Haiku Society of America. Ms. Rosenberg passed away in 1996.

Ms. Rosenberg’s daughter, Amy Losak, pitched the idea to Arts for All, a non-profit organization that brings many forms of art to public school kids, including music, theater and dance. These workshops are designed to help children develop stronger reading, writing and speaking skills.

Losak believed that her mother’s concise, compact yet highly evocative haiku – many populated with animal and children “characters” and conjuring seasonal and scenic themes -- could facilitate visual thinking and other forms of artistic expression.

""This was the case during my two years at the school and continues to hold true. There were other significant gaps in the curriculum: art, music, gym, even basics such as social studies and science were not consistently provided to students. Rafael Hernandez also has significant problems with teacher morale largely due to an unsupportive administration. This low morale, in addition to poor scheduling and curriculum choices, has a detrimental effect on 218 students. Ultimately the resulting difficulties lead many teachers to leave the school causing a high turnover rate and leaving inexperienced teachers in the classroom.""

I must say I am very great full for your detailed post. It seems that over and over again more schools sell the cover yet when you open the book no #, facts or grounds appear to withhold their claims of how great and gear for success their mission is. My son has been accepted for the upcoming year of 2014 to Eagle Academy, and must say I have done my research regarding the school to avoid making the mistake I did with his first Charter school.  Unfortunately most if not 90% of the feed back found regarding this school has been below FAIR! Which scares as to why this is not one of the school that have been placed on a probationary period by the DOE. 
Unfortunately my location in the Bx gives me little better options to choose from. 


In the pass I have hire a private tutor for an hour and half 3 times a week to assure my children are going to be successful academically.......Because they MUST and WILL succeeded in life by having great BRAINS!!! PERIOD!!So I understand your frustration when it comes to the lack of assistance and support from the people that have the KEY to make your child succeed in life...........Teachers........Thank you for your posting trust when I say parents like myself appreciate this.

What works for one may not work for another, and that's ok.

09X231,Shak75,bronx,Middle,236,"My son is a part of the inaugural middle school class at the
flagship Eagle Academy for Young Men, and we will not be returning for high school (something that was decided very early in our experience with the school). After almost 3 years as a parent of an Eagle middle school student, note that this is my opinion based on my experience, and I am sure that many can offer a complete opposite observation.  Forgive the long post, but here it goes…

As a parent who was excited to be a part of what Eagle claim
to offer its scholars, their families and the community at large, I was excited to join the family. I thought that it would be a good place for my son to be during such a transitional part of his life (middle school, puberty, expanded independence, etc.). The idea of being surrounded on a daily basis by intelligent and influential men of color – something that isn’t shoved down our throats via the media especially - was a welcome experience. I also looked forward to the ideas of structure, the uniform policy, and the fact that this
was a single gender institution. There would also be a mentor’s program that the boys were required to take part in and many other activities that would make Eagle more about an “experience” as opposed to just going to school. And while I think we were all gung ho about this mission that we would take together, to introduce our boys/scholars to the possibilities, the actual execution of these goals have left a lot to be desired in my experience as a parent of an Eagle middle schooler.

There is an impression that I got that always bothered me
when attending the bi-monthly parent meetings – an air of superiority and half-truths being fed to the masses when – if you peeked behind the curtain, things were not being run as portrayed when someone is on the open mic. Teachers would boast about how available they are – via email, telephone, whenever – and how they give homework every night, when in practice that is not the norm. There are some teachers who, despite the rock and the hard place they find themselves in oftentimes, make the effort, but the ones who do not make their staff look bad as a whole. Some have a dismissive attitude that has often had me looking at them like “well, if you’re like this with me - an adult – then I can imagine how you communicate with my son when I’m not looking.”

Oh, and that wonderful online email system – Pupil Path/ Skedula – that is such a wonderful tool that can keep us all involved and up to
date with our child’s progress…the one where you can send and receive emails, check out their grades…see “real time” progress…it’s not a requirement for teachers to use, they don’t all use it, many don’t check email (one teacher told me that for practically half of this school year his “email didn’t work”, and sometimes the grades for assignments aren’t posted until just before the marking period grades are due… when it’s too late to do anything about it. In addition, school work is not sent home after it’s graded, so I ask quite pointedly, how do I help my son study if I can’t see his work and the teacher
comments until parent-teacher conference which, to reiterate, is too late as far as the marking period is concerned?

Frustration with new the Common Core standards way of teaching has been the thorn in everyone’s side. Teachers still don’t know how
to teach it, and we parents – who did not learn in this manner – have a difficult time helping them with their work. I understand the Common Core standards in theory, but in practice it has been a difficult pill to swallow for all involved. With that understood, as an adult and a professional, there is something called appropriate behavior despite whatever frustrations one is experiencing. 

The assistant principals really are the foot soldiers who, I think, are trying their best to do what they can, but why do I have to keep
running to the assistant principals because the dean or teachers are ignoring emails or phone calls and messages?

The staff’s idea of what is and isn’t bullying is an essay that I won’t write at this time, but as a parent of a student who has had his
possessions taken from him (in front of a teacher) and thrown down the stairs, and in a separate incident, a bag of glitter dumped over his head in art class – I am beyond sick and tired of the adults not following up with ME. If I ask what the status is on something, tell me SOMETHING. I actually don’t expect resolutions to most of the incidents that go on there, but tell me something.

I made attempts to reach out to teachers when my son was out
sick, in an attempt to get work for him to do and I have heard nothing from any of them. I copy the dean – nothing! I sent the email as an FYI to the assistant principals and the parent coordinator – a woman who has doggedly worked and has truly been the people’s champion – just so they can see  that the very communication and involvement
that the teachers ask of us parents goes ignored.

I stopped going to the parent meetings for this very reason. And as a parent I own the fact that I am in some way disappointing my son by not involving myself in anything at the school anymore, but I have long since grown tired of hearing the speeches, hearing about how former Mayor Bloomberg and his administration supported the efforts of the school, hearing about how another school is going up somewhere else like a new Starbucks, when the flagship school has yet to “work out the kinks” to make it the place that a lot of us hoped for. I hate that my attitude has changed from “go team, go” to “let’s just get through the rest of the year.”

And while my own disappointments are that – my own – the boys
are the ones caught in the crossfire. 

Parent involvement has always been something that I have always
marveled over – parents show up to those meetings in droves (unlike myself this current school  year – I admit that I gave up trying to navigate through so much BS), but it is so encouraging and I
wish them the best. Their attendance alone shows that there are more people still ready and willing to make things better than not.

Good luck to everyone at the school or those considering
attending. I wish everyone the best and hope that if anything, the level of true, honest communication gets better because the only way we are going to help our boys to achieve the things that we hope for them is to work together.",2,0,0,2014-04-08T15:11:44,0.75,0.03,0.314,0.047,0.5539999999999999,0.157,0.708,0.0,0.542,0.441,0.0,0.18
09X231,Kay Jay,bronx,Middle,236,"Two years ago, I posted the wonderful review below about Eagle Academy after the completion of my son's first year.  Sadly, I have to agree with you to some extent........Eagle has changed.  I too, have had some negative experiences with some of the faculty and administrative staff.  Though the sixth grade was wonderful, the two following years grew progressively worse!  The eighth grade was particularly frustrating with more than one teacher/administrator, resulting in my husband and I deciding in the end to hire a private tutor to assist my son with his studies.  In all fairness, I have to add that I have found quite a few teachers and administrators who are caring and willing to go above and beyond to assist with issues.  I, personally, have had individuals who were not directly involved be the ones to offer the greatest level of support and assistance with finding a resolution to my issues.  

I don't think that any school will air their deficiencies to prospective students and parents, so I never expect such.  I also understand that while Eagle may LIKE to only accept the cream-of-the-crop students (wouldn't every school), they are a public school bound by NYC Dept. of Education rules and regulations, as well as working to uphold the mission of 100 Black Men (which founded Eagle Academy) to serve a population of minority students that are often ""lost"" within the educational system.  This may also mean that students who academically inclined to do well and/or are from more stable family backgrounds are exposed to others that are not like minded.  Look at the admissions criteria:  Priority for admissions is given to Bronx residents, and those that attend an information session.  Not the strictest standards.  They try to do their best with the students they have.

As a parent who has had experiences, both positive and negative, with charter schools, Catholic schools and public schools, I realize how difficult it has become to navigate something that was so much easier to do when I was a child.....get a good education!  Though my son is happy at Eagle, I am more worried about his preparedness for college.  I've let him know that as he enters high school, he has to begin to take control of his own destiny (I'm not letting go yet) and take responsibility for the things that will ensure him a brighter future.  If he fails to do so, then I will do it for him........and that will mean leaving Eagle.

Certainly, Eagle is not for every child.  No one school is.  But Eagle, in my opinion, does have its strengths.  I will remain active and supportive, make myself seen on a regular basis, and maintain my network of individuals within the school that I know to be supportive and reliable.  I am not solely relying on Eagle alone to prepare my son for college (my son is involved in extracurricular academic programs).  I let him stay because he wants to, but he also knows that if that feeling changes..........we can make change happen.

Good luck to all parents that are proactive in their quest for a good education for their children!  It's not easy, but it's not impossible.",0,0,1,2014-08-15T21:12:07,0.75,0.03,0.314,0.047,0.5539999999999999,0.157,0.708,0.0,0.542,0.441,0.0,0.18

TEACHER:  “100 BLACK MEN’S ELITE SCHOOL FALSELY IMPRISONED ME!”

New York City, December 22nd, 2010—Hal Lanse, a teacher at the elite Eagle Academy for Young Men, founded by the 100 Black Men of America, Inc. filed a lawsuit last week against the organization that included several shocking allegations.  “The principal, Osei Owusu-Afriyie, forced me to remain in a basement room denying me bathroom access.”  This, Lanse claims, was due to his union activism and the fact that he spoke out to the press when Owusu-Afriyie ordered teachers to change failing grades to passing.  “I was illegally transferred out of the school,” Lanse said. “When the Department of Education sent me back there, Owusu-Afriyie forced me to stay in the basement and personally closed the door on me on a day that the room reeked of vomit.”

“My client was also illegally suspended without pay for two weeks and not provided with COBRA health coverage, as proscribed by law,” said Linda Fox, Lanse’s attorney.  “The 100 Blacks proudly boast on their website that they founded the Eagle Academy,” Lanse said, “But I have been harassed and punished for exposing the school’s questionable practices.”

This school has a variety of amazing staff, students, and classrooms. Once you place your feet on their floor, they treat you as if you were family. The school principal, Monica Brady (or as ""Ms. Brady""), is an egalitarian. She believes that every single child on their floor, even the one's that aren't even their students, should truly know what love and family is. She also believes that the key to success is determination, passion, discipline (huge one), and commitment to achieve an objective. In this school I even learned, as a 2020 graduating 8th grader, that anything is possible, even the impossible. In life, to get what you want, where you want it, and how you want it, you must have enough ambition in order to get it. I can write millions and millions of paragraphs saying how amazing this school is, but I won't right now because it would take forever. The positive and nurturing climate is the greatest thing about my school. This school works very hard to create lasting memories through quality learning experiences and special events. That doesn't happen by accident. I really recommend this school to all students, grades 6 through 8, who are willing to strive further into becoming a better citizen in our world, a positive leader who will show other's how to be loving and passionate, and a person who is willing to make their future brighter. There is still time. There will always be. Even if it's 5.7 seconds left. But be sure to make it your best. Truly. Take the chance. The experience you will have at this school will change your life forever. Like it did to mine.

Cmsp goes to 12th grade, and most of the 8th graders (current freshman) knew this and the staff definitely made sure of that. Always making comments on how cmsp is one of the best middle and high schools in New York and how we should all stay for high school as well, when some students said they were leaving cmsp they would then make comments about how bad the school is compared to cmsp, all they want is money. This school cares way more about enforcing the uniform rule than they do of making sure the students are behaving how they are suppose to and learning how they’re suppose to, if you say something to the teacher you’re not suppose to you get a talking to, you wear navy blue boots instead of brown or black you get a call home, lunch detention, after school detention etc. Another major issue in this school would be a major case of favoritism toward the students, there’s always been a student or two who can get away with whatever they please if they’re cool with the teachers, or principals and I’ve seen this happen so many times, they protect them so they never face the consequences of their actions.

09X413,PrettySuccessful,bronx,Middle,152,"Many people say bad things about this school, but it is not so bad. I feel as if the school would have been better if more opportunities were given to ALL the students. I was in the honor's class but it was not all that because there were some kids in the honor's class who, based upon their grades, honestly did not belong there. That was the bad thing. The good thing is that I was pushed to do my best, and took AP Spanish which helped me to get a college credit in Spanish, which was geat! I don't think there is any discrimination against non-honor students. Actually, non-honor students should feel lucky because they get to relax more and do not have to feel way to pressured like I felt sometimes, but it was worth it. So, downside is that the school needs to offer more activities. Also, they need more teachers and more subjects such as physics and another language besides Spanish. Not everyone wants to learn Spanish, even though it is good to learn due to it being a rising language. Another thing is that some of the staff need to be changed because many of them had really bad attitudes and disrespected the students. The principal needs to get himself together because before I left, he seemed to stop being seen and stopped calling the students winners. So, I don't know what was going on with him, but I hope he seems more excited about the school now. Medical detectors are good for safety, even though it was annoying sometimes. So, the school is not the most amazing school ever, but it is not the worst either. I think if opportunities can not be offered in school, the counselors should offer some outside resources that can helpful to ALL students. At least it does not have violence like TAFT had back in the days.  It seems much more safe. Good luck to whoever goes there, make friends, tell a counselor and your parents if you have problems, take advantage of any opportunities given to you, and don't give up!",0,0,0,2015-08-07T14:59:06,1.0,0.243,0.22399999999999998,0.125,0.882,0.21100000000000002,0.809,0.066,0.28300000000000003,0.632,0.006999999999999999,0.187

Mrs Carlson left and now we have the 1st and 2nd grade AP as our Principle. (Mrs Riley) Our Spanish teacher doesn't even teach, she cries during class because 3 kids are being disrespectful, She tells us to go to some website called ""QuiaBooks"" which half of their activities don't work. But she still does our grades based upon that, plus most don't even have computers. I understand this is 21st century but most families are going through hard times and she doesn't seem to understand that. The only decent teacher is the Math & Social Studies teacher. Mrs Fox & Mr Prashad. My Mother even complains about this school, how they stopped caring about the kids once I reached 5th grade and ever since then it's went downhill. I suggest you do a new review on this school because it's nothing what you described. 

And No we don't eat Tacos, Mac and cheese anymore. We only have Pizza's on Friday's which are mostly burnt, some type of chopped beef with a bun, and turkey Burgers.

I am writing you as a concerned parent of 2 children at P.S. 24.  If you are not aware of the malfeasance  currently plaguing the school, check out http://nypost.com/2015/10/25/desk-dumping-principal-in-hot-water-for-overcrowding-school/

Now this overcrowding is in no small part  because well intentioned parents from other neighborhoods wanted to reap the benefits that P.S.24 had to offer, so they found ways to make it APPEAR that their child lived in the district.  It would certainly  be a unfortunate  turn of events if these students were forced to go back to a neighborhood school that did not have the resources of P.S.24.  This scenario could possibly happen, if TRAILERS are put on PS24 property.

     You can help though by calling the leaders of Bronx Community Board 8.  Call them, email them and ask them to represent on your behalf to the NYCDOE to get a new building space for a P.S.24 annex

Donna Connelly at Ps 24 in the Bronx has been controversial for years; she was pushed out of ps 3 by parents when my daughter was there, has been despised by teachers and also threw a reporter out of an SLT meeting a few years ago- illegally as the DoE spokesperson later explained.

10X024,bitterbatter,bronx,Elementary,844,"no misinformation whatsoever - my son was attending PS 24 when this went down, so i know all about it, first hand.  and, you are confusing 2 issues.  the first issue is about the ways in which a principal can and cannot replace teachers, according to DOE and UFT rules.  the second has to do with budget shortfalls system-wide, not just at PS 24.  parents were asked for donations by the parent association - not the school! - for UP TO $1k, according to a family's available income.  some families gave $25, $50, whatever they could afford, and that was great...  whatever the amount, the purpose of those donations was to provide funds to hire kindergarten teachers' assistants , as you correctly state.  the school relied on the PA to raise those funds because the DOE is not providing enough funds to cover those costs, although enrollment continues to rise at all schools, system-wide.  PAs are doing this across the city, because their children benefit, and a public education is otherwise free!  and, the program was a success - extra teachers assistants were hired to help teach 8 kindergarten classes, up from 5 or 6 the year before!  another example of how the staff and parent body work together so beautifully at this school...

but the kindergarten fundraising program had nothing to do with the music teachers.  in that case, the administration was just trying to upgrade the music department staff.  the most direct path they saw was to take a year off from the music program, which would allow them to excess the music teachers, and reapply the funds elsewhere.  then the following year, they could reallocate money for an all new music department and start fresh with new teachers.  but because the parents reacted so strongly,  the admin retreated and rehired the same teachers.  whether this was the right or wrong way to go about trying to renew the music program can be debated, but everyone should realize it was done with the intention of ultimately providing a BETTER music program.  if you look at all of the other improvements in the arts programs and elsewhere at the school since this administration took over, it's obvious that they were just trying to upgrade the music program as well, not to take it away permanently.",0,0,3,2015-07-29T15:06:28,0.75,0.043,0.14800000000000002,0.026000000000000002,0.855,0.044000000000000004,0.19,0.091,0.075,0.43,0.355,0.11199999999999999

Ironically, none of these outside programs is supposed to function without a permanent music teacher, and once two of them both threatened to walk and take away the instruments they donated, the principal reinstated one teacher. There is no better music program, a three  years later. 

As far as K, assistant principal said to many parents who complained that paras don't make money for the school, and most schools in the city don't have K assistants, and canned all of them.

You also can try for G&T if you live in D 10, and then you can go there if you qualify. That's the law, that's the rule.

10X024,Former Student,bronx,Elementary,844,"I graduated from ps24 in 08. A lot of us in the accelerated class ended up in stuyvesant, hunter, bronx science, or lehman's high school of american studies.
 ps24 was amazing and I didn't realize at the time how fortunate we were to have a planetarium, an art studio, and cool events like springfest and the dance festival. Lastly, if someone says the accelerated classes aren't challenging they are misinformed are lying. In fourth grade we had to read New York Times articles (about two to three a day) and respond to at least 5 questions for each. I stay up as late doing stuy hw as i did in fourth grade.
However, I graduated the year mr. sharpener (horrible inside joke) became principal so i dont know if the new administrations have lowered the standards.",5,0,0,2011-10-20T01:50:31,0.75,0.043,0.14800000000000002,0.026000000000000002,0.855,0.044000000000000004,0.19,0.091,0.075,0.43,0.355,0.11199999999999999
