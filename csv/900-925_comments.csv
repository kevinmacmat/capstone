Hereâs the piece:

By The Faculty of P.S. 167

Imagine your first day at a new school. You are surrounded by new faces and new teachers and are navigating a new building. What are you concerned about? Making new friends? Liking your new teachers?

When they enter our school each fall, our sixth-graders write about their hopes and fears for middle school. This year, 35 percent said their greatest fear was failing the state tests. At one of the most socially difficult times of their lives, over a third of our children have more anxiety about standardized tests than any other issue.

What has happened?

We â the teachers of a public secondary school in New York City â are writing because we wish you to join us in asking this question about whatâs happening in our schools. We ask you to consider our experiences and the experiences of our students in a world where schools face more standardized tests and increasing pressures related to their outcomes than ever before.

This year in our school, as in schools across the country, we have seen the number of standardized tests we are required to administer grow sharply, from 25 to more than 50 (in grades 6-10). In the next six weeks alone, each of our sixth-graders will be required to take 18 days of tests: three days of state English tests, three days of state math tests, four days of new city English and math benchmark tests, and eight days of new English, math, social studies and science city tests to evaluate teacher performance. Additionally, students who are learning English must spend two to three more days taking the NYSESLAT test for English Language Learnersâa total of 21 days in just the next few weeks.

Consider your own education. Yes, high-school students have always faced college entrance and graduation exams. But as elementary or middle-school students prior to No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, you likely had no more than a few days of standardized testing every spring (if that). For todayâs students, however, these standardized tests have become a centerpiece of their educational experience. Time spent on these tests is time not spent on learning or teaching. The centrality of testing should be shocking, but instead is somehow accepted as commonplace.

One teacher at our school asked her seventh-graders how they felt about the tests. The word âscaredâ came up multiple times, as did the word âhate.â

âI feel nervous,â said one, âbecause you think youâre not going to pass.â Another protested, âI donât think tests show our learning, and they donât show our growth.â A third stated, âIt makes it more possible to fail.â

If this seems overly dramatic, consider that in New York City, 70 percent of students are labeled âfailing.â This is not, as many believe, a function of low performance, but a deliberate decision by the state to increase the number of students labeled âfailingâ in a move that has created more pressure on teachers and schools, and public support for newâuntestedâreform initiatives. We question the collateral consequences of such a mechanism for educational change.

Let us be clear at the outset: as a staff, we are not opposed to all standardized tests and believe that, used sparingly, such tests can provide useful feedback to schools, teachers and possibly students. We are instead concerned about their vast and increasing number andâjust as disconcertingâoutsized influence. The tests are no longer about feedback. The stakes attached to them now commonly include school funding and evaluation and closure, teacher pay and evaluation and firings, and of course student promotion and self-perception. It should come as no surprise that many schools have chosen to focus more and more of the school year on what is often called âtest prep.â

Consider the case of two of our U.S. history teachers who sought to engage students in a case study about Fred Korematsu and the ways in which the rights of U.S. citizens have been suspended in times of war. At the last minute, worried about the impending Regents Exam, these teachers felt compelled to drop this important, in-depth investigation that would tap into student passions and diversity. Instead, they made the difficult decision to âcoverâ a broad and sanitized survey of U.S. foreign policy from the Monroe Doctrine to the Cold War.

As it turns out, the thematic essay on last yearâs U.S. History Regents test was on American foreign policy, and the vast majority of our students passed the test. Did we make the right decision?

What does it mean to âtest-prepâ students as a means for teaching them to read and write? It means to teach without context or commitment, without personal connection or application. It means to teach using excerpted writing passages and scripted questions. David Coleman, architect of the Common Core standards that serve as the basis for the latest tests, shared his opinion that âas you grow up in this world you realize people really donât give a sh*t about what you feel or what you think.â A curriculum based on standardized tests implies that our studentsâ lives, our lives, and the vibrant lives of our communities just donât seem to matter.

In contrast, as teachers we recognize every day that there is no true curriculum without studentsâ lives, engagement and voices.

One of the central characteristics of our school has been that all content and skills are embedded in real-world curricula. We have a common understanding that students produce better work when they believe it is meaningful, when academic work spills into the world and back again. Our students make presentations to elementary-school students about bullying and to hospital institutional review boards about medical research proposals. They work with the Metropolitan Transit Authority on bus engine design, and with the Queens Memory Project on interviewing and preserving immigrantsâ stories in Queens.

They may spend weeks on a single case study, developing nuanced understandings of complex problems. In this work, they are evaluated by school-based assessments that, in contrast to standardized tests, take the shape of diverse projects and presentations. Standards, including the Common Core, are a central part of our curriculum work, but they are only one of many considerations embedded in the work our students do.

As external pressure increases to sacrifice curriculum for the sake of âtest prep,â all of us have been forced to make difficult decisions. We often hear policymakers tell us that a strong curriculum will result in strong test scores. This is simply not true. Standardized tests are, by definition, tests removed from student engagement and context; they require a particular kind of teaching that is antithetical to what most of us believe education should be. Many of us as teachers think of test prep as unprofessional and unethical. All of us believe curriculum should never begin or end with standardized tests.

This year, we took a stand on this point by subverting the evaluation of our teachers based on standardized tests. A new mandate in New York Cityâa direct result of Race to the Topârequires each teacher to be evaluated by two standardized tests, most of us for at least one subject we donât teach (the city recommended that schools evaluate their music teachers, for example, based on English and math scores). It also dramatically increased the number of tests and used tests that had never been piloted. We found this untenable.

When the city asked us to choose two standardized tests for each teacher as part of her or his evaluation, we all agreed to assign ourselves the same tests wherever possible. For one of the tests, all of our middle-school teachers will be evaluated on the state English test for all of our students. The result: students will take the minimum number of new tests, and teachers will all receive the same score. If our students fail, all of us will fail together. In this decision, we affirm our belief that we are a teaching community that collaborates and shares curricula, not a collection of individual good or bad teachers. We will not have our entire school community bound to a barrage of tests.

It is a small but important act of resistance.

 

So how might all of us, as citizens with a stake in our schools, resist the narrowing of curriculum and studentsâ lives? First, it is clear to us that our elected officials must hear from more than principals and teachers that creating new tests and tying more consequences to those tests cannot be the core of any education reform plan.

 

Second, some of us are also supportive of the Opt-Out movement that is growing across the country, wherein parents have creatively removed their children from standardized testing. In doing so, they refuse districts and states the data with which to evaluate students, teachers and schools based on standardized tests.

 

Some of us are more ambivalent about this movement. But we all know that to move forward, we must do more than say no to a system in which we do not believe. We seek systems where assessments can be effective at supporting students, systems where assessments are valid, reliable and fair. Based on our experiences, we have come to believe that these systems must be built through the work of individual schools, not through large-scale standardized tests.

 

We suggest that policymakers begin by moving resources away from standardized test creation and toward supporting the development of quality assessments in schools. Perhaps they might create incentives for schools to design their own school-based assessments, or encourage schools to move toward performance- and project-based assessment practices shared strategically among schools (see, for example, the New York Performance Standards Consortium of schools).

 

We cannot emphasize enough that any schoolâs capacity to develop is profoundly related to the allocation of school resources. Our school invests in lower student-teacher ratios, increased hours of teacher collaboration each week, and a week of paid curriculum development before the school year begins. Each year we struggle to find this funding, and we have often fallen short of our goal.

 

This week, as our school enters another season of testing, our sixth- and eighth-grade teachers have chosen to read to students a principalâs letter that one parent posted online: âWe are concerned that these tests do not always assess all of what it is that make each of you special and unique â¦ the scores you get will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything. There are many ways of being smart.â

 

Our students spontaneously cheered. That they could be seen as individuals with interests and friends and dreamsânot just as a set of numbersâdeeply resonated with them.

 

At the end of the day, we hope students see their educations not only as a means to graduate, jumpstart their careers or get into college, but as a means to investigate, interact with and innovate in a rapidly changing world. As John Dewey reminds us, âEducation is not preparation for life, but life itself.â We believe in a curriculum that is rich and personalâthat is, for the living. To treat curriculum and schools otherwise is to demean education, reducing it to no more than training or indoctrination in a world that needs people to be so much more.",0,0,0,2014-04-11T14:23:18,0.75,0.037000000000000005,0.175,0.008,0.591,0.048,0.442,0.24100000000000002,0.14800000000000002,0.389,0.16899999999999998,0.073

I must share about the
first semester where my child learnt about âFood Glorious Foodâ, it was so in
depth and a great learning experience for our household. It changed how we ate
and switching to healthier eating habits. Parents also had the chance to come
in and learn hands on as children educate them about what are some ingredients in
foods we eat and how they are bad for our health.

28Q167,Queens Student,queens,Middle,378,"9th grade has been a pretty good year. MELS offers many opportunities  for freshman's, academically and extra-curricular wise, like an afterschool credit bearing elective, college trips, and after school Regents prep, just to name a few.
 
Academics: What's said about MELS at the top of this page, ""The downside"", this is correct, that the learning style at MELS may not suit everyone. Even though MELS has a hands on/experience style of learning, my teachers this year have given me other work that suits my learning best. (I'm a textbook type of student and like things straight to the point.)
It'd be great if we had more electives next year. I am also eagerly awaiting for AP classes at MELS.

Athletics: Like other high schools in NYC, MELS is part of the PSAL (Public School Athletic League). MELS (high school) does not have it's own sports teams, but our neighboring high school, Queens Metropolitan, has sports teams and a variety of teams to to join. My PE teacher encourages all students to join our campus' sports teams and is very supportive of our athletic aspirations.

Another issue I have is uniform shirts.Â  When we first went to the school and filled out the form stating how many of each shirts we wanted, I thought that is what we would be getting when we went to pickÂ  them up.Â  Boy was I wrong.Â  We were told we were only allowed a set amount because they did not have enough.Â  Then what was the point of completing the order form if we were not going to get what we ordered?Â  I was then told that they would receive more shirtsÂ in December of 2011.Â  Whenever I called they did not get them.Â Â  I called everymonth and still no shirts.Â  Now this is the second year.Â  I tried again and now they don't have the size.Â  My son unfortunately is still wearing the same shirts he had in 6th grade.Â  It seems as if he will be graduating from high school in the same shirts because we have to getÂ any additionalÂ shirts from them.Â

And the students grades have been dropping. 85% of the students in Mels were doing great in the school last but since they are in Mels it dropped to 75% test scores look it up.,1,0,0,2012-01-04T01:57:18,0.75,0.037000000000000005,0.175,0.008,0.591,0.048,0.442,0.24100000000000002,0.14800000000000002,0.389,0.16899999999999998,0.073
28Q167,Imann,queens,Middle,378,"As an 8th Grader at MELS, with perfect attendance since the first day of MELS, thereÂ hasn'tÂ been any violence between teachers and students. And it is true, some students feel that they did better in their old schools, but they were in a grade lower then where they are now, so they wouldn't have known whether or not they would still face the same academic challenges and have the same curriculum. Students are taught to be advocates of themselves and when they have a problem with something in class, they advocate for themselves. Students here take Acuity exams to see where they are at in their learning, and if they have problems, then they are MORE than welcome to talk with teachers, and even students who can help them in challenge areas. There is also about 5 programs were students can come and study to prepare for their test and bring up their grades. And text books don't define the way you learn. Students may be used to textbooks, and that is understandable since they've used textbooks for most of their school lives, but the same curriculum is being taught with a text book or not.Â ",6,0,1,2012-01-18T00:15:54,0.75,0.037000000000000005,0.175,0.008,0.591,0.048,0.442,0.24100000000000002,0.14800000000000002,0.389,0.16899999999999998,0.073
28Q167,MELSM,queens,Middle,378,"I agree with MELSPARENT.Â  Although they weren't extremely knowledgeable about the high school application process, it is because we all promised to stay for high school - they were clearly caught off guard by some surprisingly aggressive behavior by a small group of perhaps 3 parents who were at that meeting.Â  Applying for the specialized high schools was strongly encouraged.Â Â I don't know of anyÂ public schools in Forest Hills that provided tutoring for the exam.Â  In fact, all of the kids that took the exam (that we know of) took the preparatory classes with Princeton or Kaplan.Â I agree that the lack of text books makes it very hard to track the curriculum - they should email the detailed curriculum to each household (assuming they want to be ""green"").Â  Â Â  Â ",3,0,0,2011-12-29T19:03:20,0.75,0.037000000000000005,0.175,0.008,0.591,0.048,0.442,0.24100000000000002,0.14800000000000002,0.389,0.16899999999999998,0.073
28Q167,Yvonne,queens,Middle,378,"Russell Sage, a local middle school in Forest Hills, provided one year of free tutoring for the SHSAT test to some students in the 7th grade.

Parents would do well to look at other high schools in NYC based on the expeditionary learning style before signing on to this school. Â I was told to look at one in Staten Island by the principals after questioning the expeditionary learning methodology and while i do not think testing should be the only criteria to measure a school, their regents exam numbers are appalling. Â Only 2% scored over an 85 in the integrated regents tests. Â In geometry and trig -0 percent. Â And, their numbers are not much better in science. Â https://reportcards.nysed.gov/files/2009-10/CIR-2010-353100011064.pdf Â If I had this information before my child went to this school I would have though twice about sending my kid here.

MELS is a school where there is little to no homework and although my child has a 99 average I know this is a watered down grade. Â At her old school she had a 97 but she studied 1-2 hours a night. Â Look at your child's notebook in math and then look at another school where kids are taking the integrated algebra regents. Â The regents is just one criteria but in a school with no textbooks and very little substantive homework, what recourse do we have? Also I am using math as an example here because it is easier to compare a math curriculum than an English one but there are issues in other subjects.

Just because a kid may have a decent GPA from MELS does not mean they are getting a good education. I for one want to warn parents because I don't want them to see how weak their child's education was once they are paying the high costs of college. Our kids deserve a rigorous education! Please MELS, step it up!

28Q167,Yvonne,queens,Middle,378,"As a parent I must say that the school has a very caring staff, Â Teachers get to know your child and you feel like you are part of a family. They go above and beyond and for this I am thankful. Â That being said, I think that this school is not for everyone. I feel that in order to have compassion and sensitivity I have given up a rigorous preparatory education for my child (something the school had promised). Â The lack of any textbooks has meant a detailed look at the Â curriculum is hard. Â And this has made it incredibly difficult to know what your child will be learning. Â For me this really hit home in the math program. My child was looking for a solid math class and this has not been the case. Â Most of the math she did in seventh grade at this school she had done in 5th at her other school. Â We have had meetings and talked with the principals. Â The result, an 8th grade integrated math class that will only allow a child to take the regents if they are selected to take an after school class starting in January. Â If you have a hard working student I don't think she should be in a class for a year and a half before she finally learns something new ( actually she did learn one thing, bias in data! Â The principals make a big deal about not tracking but you can do differentiated study without pulling a kid out of class. Â They do it in elementary school. Â  Also, if you are remotely interested in going to another school after 8th grade you will be doing all the work yourself and because you have no guidance counselor you have to request a ticket from the principals. Â However, Â this may put some parents in a very compromising position because if you want to talk over the options they are only there to get you what you need, not talk about the pros/cons of any other school. I went to MELS High School meeting last night and not once did they say the dates for requesting a ticket for the SHSAT test but they did remind us on several occasions that they had invested quite a bit in our children.

They are in the High Honors classes, which I will get to in a minute. Mrs. Grant, who I agree, can occasionally dodge around things, is an above average principal. The only reason why she tends to not immediately answer parent's questions is because she has so many other things to deal with. So please parents, do not be mean.

28Q190,718Parent,queens,Middle,1082,"Our child just finished 6th Grade and had an ok year.  Elementary school teacher recommendation and grades determined 6th Grade class placement.  Teachers were great, liked teaching middle school and our child was engaged, learned a lot.    In May, right before Hunter School acceptance responses due, all 6th Graders interested in applying for 7th Grade High Honors Class were given a math test.  At Sage, that end of 6th Grade math test is ONLY factor determining entrance into 7th Grade High Honors Class. Your class grades, even if you have high 90s average in all classes and exceptional teacher recommendations, do not factor into the equation, since it is not a ""whole student"" assessment.  If you do not do well on that one math test, you it is EXTREMELY unlikely school will place you in 7th Grade High Honors Class (really, that's really the way it is).  We were also told that this math test is used to determine the language you study after 6th Grade, with higher math score kids being given French and lower math score kids being given Spanish.  

7th Grade High Honors Class tracks through to 8th Grade High  Honors class so that if you do not gain admission into High Honors Class in 7th Grade, you can not enter High Honors Class in 8th Grade.  Advantage to being in High Honors Class is that math and science studies are accelerated to prepare to be ready in 8th Grade to take the math and science Regents that most kids typically take in 9th Grade.  Significant to note this accelerated math, science to Regents exam path is same at NEST+M, Anderson, BSGE and other G&T/Honors programs throughout city.  The High Honors Class is the only class at Sage following this curriculum, so if you are not in the High Honors Class, you will not take any Regents in 8th Grade.  Kids coming out of the High Honors Class are well prepared for High School admissions process and placement out of the High Honors Class is usually exceptional.  Note also that this year there was some difficulty with paperwork and, 3 days before exam given, current 8th Graders were told they were not allowed to take the Integrated Algebra Regents exam (and didn't take the exam).

Should add Sage groups kids based on data so that kids end up tracked in a class by data driven assessment of ability - and stay with that class for every subject.  Means you can not be in high level for one subject and lower level for another subject (because each class attends all subjects as group and instruction intended to aim at group level).  Next year, have heard there will be two High Honors Classes, then other classes tracked below that.  School administration says there are other ""Honors Classes"" below those two High Honors Classes, but those other Honors Classes don't follow accelerated curriculum.  I don't know why those other classes are called ""Honors Classes"" and how instruction and curriculum in those classes differs from a regular class.",0,0,0,2015-06-24T18:48:11,0.5,0.102,0.134,0.039,0.6759999999999999,0.043,0.34,0.324,0.07,0.271,0.299,0.171

28Q190,Carmelle Reynafarje,queens,Middle,1082,"Ok so i am a current student at russell sage. I attend in 8th grade and this is my second year at sage, (I started sage in 7th grade) I just want to take some time to clear some things up. (Disclaimer-This is my OWN PERSONAL OPINION, so dont call me a pompus jerk, or whatever, I am intitled to my opinion, and what I feel) So to start off with the girl who doodled on the desk. Mrs.Grant DID NOT over react, it is SCHOOL POLICY, and the BOARD OF ED'S rules that if someone is CAUGHT writing/drawing on the desk they either get save room or are suspended. So NO she did not over react, she was following protocol. Now to address the teachers. I AGREE that SOME teachers can be very mean, and very dis-understanding. I don't want to call anyone out, but my 7th grade social studies teacher (who is now my 8th grade social studies teacher AGAIN!!) Picks and chooses her favorite kids, She favors the smarter kids, and the kids who tend to lack in social studies...SHE YELLS AT THEM! I remember last year, She didn't like me (But I did my work, Yet, and i will admit, I was a little talkative) I never interrupted her when she was talking, and i listened quite intently when she would give a lesson, but last year (again she didnt like me) She was explaining a project, and my friend Eric, did not understand, so I explained it again, but slower. And Â then my teacher heard and YELLED ""WHO SAID THAT?!?!?!?!"" and I raised my hand and explained to her that I was helping my friend to understand better, but instead of saying ok, just explain to him later, not while im talking she YELLED AT ME AGAIN saying ""WELL, KNOCK IT OFF!!!"" I remember crying, because it wasn't fair she was picking on me when I was simply explaining it to my friend!!! So yes, there are some really mean teachers. Moving on to this year 2012, I am enjoying my senior year quite Well, although I have the same social studes teacher, my other teachers (ELA,math, spanish, technology, ETC. ) Are really understanding and nice. Now to addess the after school activities. NOW, (***CURRENTLY***) Russell sage DOES allow you to start an after school group, I have started the Debate Team in my school, and last year I started a group called ""Help out without a doubt"" so we raised money and donated it to various charities. There is Drama, chorus, french, yearbook, band, newspaper, etc. The are MANY clubs/groups. There is also a FREE after school program called Beacon, located in the cafeteria from 2:30-5:30. To address the SECURITY GUARDS. NO they are Â not kinder to some kids rather than others, they ARE NOT racist in anyway shape or form!!! (YES IV'E BEEN TO OTHER SCHOOLS, SO I CAN COMPARE) They are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. They really connect with kids our age, they are funny, but sensitive at the same time. The reason why they kick kids out of the park is because, AND YES IT'S A PUBLIC PARK, but the reason is that there were complaints about bigger kids, interrupting/hurting/annoying some of the littler kids that play in the kiddie park. So they have the park closed to bigger kids that attend sage from 2:30-3:10 after 3:10 the bigger kids are welcome back into the park. This school is one of the most diverse schools, yes it has a couple of bad things, and YES, i've had a lot of bad memories, but all of my good memories drown out the bad ones. This school is where i met my Best friend! So if i hadn't came here I wouldn't have met her.

WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS SCHOOL?



The School Principal Ms. Grant, recently sent a very inappropriate letter to
the parents of the honor students saying among other things: ""Your child's
grades in class are not reflective of the academic ability we expect from an
8th grade student""
That surprise me since my son has over 90 in science, math and foreign
language.
The School never communicate with us about how our kids is doing in class and
suddenly The Principal sent us a letter telling us that ""The academic performance
of your child in her/his classes has been very disappointing"" and âYour
child was placed in Honorâs with the expectation of taking the Earth Science or
Living Environment Regentsâ Examination in Juneâ¦â ââ¦ I do not think that she/He
is up to the challengeâ.


Ms. Marylyn Grant I have some question:


Why you sent this letter to every honor student?


Every one is not âup to the challengeâ?
Having over 90 in math and science is very disappointing for you?
Having over 95 in foreign language is very disappointing for you?
My son has gotten 4's on his statewide Math and English tests. That is very
disappointing for you?
Something is very, very wrong in this school.

I want to maintain the integrity of the program by having students perform to the best of their ability. If students are not doing homework,not asking for extra help, or not studying for the tests-that's a problem. We have high expectations for student success.

28Q190,Discontent Parent ,queens,Middle,1082,"Russell Sage is in serious decline and is in serious need of improvement. My daughter is on medication which makes her need to urinate more frequently. I sent a medical note to the guidance counselor to inform her teachers and allow her to go to the bathroom more often. Instead, the teachers scold her, and still do not allow her to go as often as she needs to. This has done damage to her kidneys, as well as social damage. can you imagine your middle schooler having to relieve herself in her pants, because your teacher doesn't understand you have a medical condition? When I approached the guidance counselor about this, she had said she had forgotten to pass the note to the teachers. A week later, there was no improvement and when I inquired about this, she said, again she forgot. Â I was told to go speak to the principal directly about medical issues such as his, but she would not even make the time for me. Instead, she dumped me on to the guidance counselor again.Â 

Next, the guidance counselor moved my daughter's class 2 weeks into the school year from an honors class to a non-honors class. I honestly don't mind if she was in honors, or not honors (though to be fair, my daughter has gotten 4's on her statewide math/english tests ),Â but what was really frustrating was that she moved 2 weeks into the school year (after friends and cliques have formed).Â This has stressed out my daughter completely, who feels isolated (as she is new to the neighborhood) and already has an underlying medical condition (an auto-immune disorder) that amplifies (physiologically) any stressors.Â Â I kindly asked the GC to move my daughter back into the original class, if space were to become available.Â Â Later, I found out a kid from my daughter's new class was moved into her original class, instead of my daughter. Â My daughter has come home crying with a fever for three days in a row because she is so discontent and stressed out with Russell Sage, along with her underlying auto-immune disorder.. When I complained to the guidance counselor about it, she said ""if you don't like it, go to a different school"".Â 
Fed up with Russell Sage, IÂ successfullyÂ moved my daughter to Hallsey, with a medical note from the state. The principal took the time out personally to meet with me and my daughter. She told my daughter that if any teacher does not allow her to use the bathroom, that she would speak personally to that teacher about my daughter. They were much moreÂ accommodatingÂ and caring. They saw my daughters state exam scores, and placed in honors classes again. Â I am so glad to be done with Russell Sage. Â Avoid sending your children here, if possible.Â ",7,1,0,2011-09-30T02:01:29,0.5,0.102,0.134,0.039,0.6759999999999999,0.043,0.34,0.324,0.07,0.271,0.299,0.171

28Q190,parent,queens,Middle,1082,"Russell Sage is not run properly.Â  Ms. Grant has no backbone or common sense.Â  She will call the police/acs or anyone else before she uses her brains to figure things out.Â  She is rude and will dance around things you question her about.Â  We are all adults so why can't she admit that perhaps she was wrong?Â  She claims to want parent involvement but is rather rude to parents.Â  She doesn't make it easy for parents.Â  Engrade is a computer system that parents can use to see how their child is doing in school.Â  Not all teachers use it and the ones that do don't always have it up to date.Â Parent cannot rely on it.

To date, in addition to Sage, I have attended: PS 11, Hillsborough Elementary School '05, Auten Road Intermediate School '07, Hillsborough Middle School '09 ( I moved during 7th grade) & Stuyvesant High School '13. So yes, I doÂ believeÂ I can pass judgement on this topic. While I understand there is a severe lack of funding for the school, it most certainly does not justify the behavior of the (unfortunate) majority of the staff and administration at this school. During my time there I wasÂ appalledÂ by the unwarranted, not to mention utterly unprofessional, lack of respect some teachers and administrators had towards the students. Â You should also know, I had never made serious trouble of any sort while IÂ attendedÂ Sage, all students wereÂ treatedÂ this way. Furthermore, the ratio of genuine, competent & compassionate teachers (shout-out to Mrs. Glass, Mr. Collins & Ms. Saklabanakis!) to arrogant andÂ unenthusiastic teachers is devastatingly low.

graduation was a mess. they ""ran out"" of certificates, which is bull, considering we actually paid to attend. i never got anything on the last day as promised, but rather, in the mail postmarked 7 months after graduation. i had to come to school towards teh end of the summer vacation to pick up my diploma.
now at my current high school, seeing any property similar to the quality of the desks at russell sage would disgust me. in all honesty, i recall not wanting to touch the desks in half my classes, and pretty much every desk was vandalized. yet at my current school nearly every desk looks brand new, even though they've been there for years.

there were some wonderful and intelligent students and teachers at this school, but unfortunately, most of them weren't. 

also in contrast to that review, home economics doesn't exist at this school. yes, i attended during that year, and we were pushed into either art, drama with a teacher on maternal leave, another art class with a teacher who often got sick, or band. 
and there is no test prep for shsat or anything. the only thing after school is tutoring and detention. actual after school programs cost money.

Out of six years, we've had two very good teachers, two were competent, and the other two years the teachers were duds. Otherwise, the school is fine --it's clean, tidy, they promote good behavior, have great clubs like Chorus and Lego Robotics. 

But --and this might apply to many schools today--in their effort to be nice and alternative, basic things like knowing the multiplication table forward and backward, reciting their ABCs, learning to look up words in the dictionary, are strangely bypassed. The teachers didn't seem to think that's important anymore--and if your children doesn't have the basics down pat, they recommend tutoring such as Kumon. By year six, I've understood that the only way to get a good education is through a mix of supplementing -- a math tutor, a Saturday prep course, parental coaching, etc. Can't rely on schools anymore to give kids their core skills.",10,0,0,2011-02-14T03:38:43,1.0,0.066,0.139,0.037000000000000005,0.968,0.012,0.16399999999999998,0.375,0.021,0.111,0.424,0.066

- school has non-academic classes, such as arts, music, and gym available to all students of all grades

Cons
- office staff is about as unfriendly as it gets; they ignore you when you walk in and then act like you disrupted them from something important
- leadership/mgmt is terrible; when all's well, they are sweet; when issues are brought to their attention, they try to sweep it under the rug and pretend nothing happened.

Dear PS 220 White Teachers Who Wore NYPD T-Shirts To School,

It must have seemed like a fantastic idea when, despite warnings from from the United Federation of Teachers, you all donned NYPD shirts and crowded in front of a camera for a smirking group portrait. Through this lens, which is conspicuously White, those matching gray shirts might either be a tone-deaf display of team spirit, or a more troubling reification of how you regard your relationship to the minority student body. Whatever the intention, you have managed to introduce the armed and socially embroiled segment of the judicial system into the classroom in the most polarizing way.

unapproachable. They are not open to suggestions. They allow students to run
around the hallways, assault teachers and paraprofessionals.  There doesnât seem to be any consequences for
these unruly children.  Shouldnât they be
suspended?  These children are preventing
other children from learning.  The

Since my son has his own issues with separation anxiety, I would have liked some school-based assistance with this issues.  None offered.

I have only seen my son's teacher twice at morning line-up, other than that there are aides, and 4th grade monitors assisting with this experience.

28Q220,AllenKaps,queens,Elementary,667,"""This school is really unorganized,"" writes a parent. ""Teachers are absent excessively and the office staff is really rude. My child's class is going on its second movie trip so far in April and they have only gone on one short educational trip. I would not reccommend this school.""  

<P>Mindy Merdinger Blackstock, president of the Parents Association and mother of a 2nd grader with special needs in a CTT class, responds to the comment above: ""If you look at the teacher absenteeism compared to other schools, P.S. 220 absenteeism is comparable. I suspect that this parent does not understand the difference between the enrichment classes that our teachers are required to attend since PS 220 is a Title I school and a true absence. These enrichment classes help the 220 teachers to be better teachers. While other schools may use the time to put the children in the auditorium in front of a film, PS 220 utilizes substitute teachers at greater expense to make sure the students do not miss out on academics. As for the criticism regarding students attending two movies, both movies were incorporated into the curriculum in creative ways that encourage learning. ""The Bee Movie"" was part of a behavior and manners program used by the entire school and as you walk around the building, you will see the collection of bees that the students have earned for good and positive behavior and actions. ""Horton Hears a Who"" was part of the school's Dr. Seuss celebration. ... </P>
<P>The school is a vibrant place with caring and creative teachers who give so much to these kids. ... [But] parent involvement at this school is appalling and it frustrates me immensely. Other parents are quick to criticize what they do not understand, and they do not take the time to learn what is what before they criticize. Only when a parent makes the effort to work with the school can a parent accurately assess a school. ... Ms. Pizarro is very approachable and truly cares about the children and the school. Ms. Rosenberg, the IEP teacher, is truly a gift! ... The office staff may seem brusque at times to someone who has not taken the time to get to know them, but this is only because they are busy handling the important things, like seeing that our children get individualized attention, proper busing, proper support and an excellent education.

28Q284,Dr. Marcia Coombs,queens,Middle,290,"I am a teacher at the York Early College Academy, affectionately called YECA. At YECA, we are a family. We care about each other academically, emotionally and socially. I am sorry to hear that Ms. Durant had an awful experience, however this goes to show that she is still on earth. There will always be some kind of discomfort even in the most comfortable places. If Ms. Durant reports that nothing was done about her bullying experience, it would be difficult to believe, especially during Ms. Burnett-Worthy's tenure as Principal. Ms. Worthy always gets to the bottom of the trouble of the students. Her main objective every day was to make the environment conducive to learning. I will not say that Ms. Durant is lying, I am just saying that because she was hurt, she decides to hurt the school. It is not fair to bash a school because you had a bad experience. What about the good experiences? Is she trying to say that she never had a good experience at YECA? What about the nurturing that the teachers gave her every day? What about the love shared by the community? YECA is a wonderful place to work and learn. The Administration and the staffs(custodial & Academic) work in tandem to provide a great learning experience every day. It is a pleasure to see how students help each other to succeed. I have worked in dog-eat-dog schools, where teachers are competing negatively with each other to see who can be the best, students competing negatively with each other to see who can get the highest GPA in order to look down on their peers, parents competing negatively with each other to see who can volunteer more time or contribute more resources to try to bribe teachers to work harder with their kids. At YECA competition is present but it is healthy. Students compete against each other but they do not put their peers down. They try to help their peers to succeed too, Parents and teachers are actively involved in competition to see how many kids they can help to succeed bu they are willing to help each other to reach their goals. YECA is a haven compared to some other places. We have achieved a lot for the short existence that we have had. We are a reward school, The school has also been recognized in the National Rankings and earned a bronze medal. Schools are ranked based on their performance on state-required tests and how well they prepare students for college.We have had a 98% graduation rate and our students are meeting and exceeding State Standards. What more can you ask for? I would recommend this school to those who believe in dreams. We prepare students to be forward thinking, tenacious leaders. YECA is definitely the school for your kids if you want them to make a difference in this world.",0,0,0,2018-08-24T16:22:21,1.0,0.017,0.124,0.0,0.848,0.040999999999999995,0.386,0.252,0.503,0.086,0.01,0.1

28Q284,Jaquaan White,queens,Middle,290,"I have been going to this school for the past 6 years and I am currently a senior. This school is a tight-knit community where everyone may not know the names of the people they see in the halls, but most definitely know their faces. It boils my blood that people like Julianna Durant and ""John Doe"" would come to this website's comment section and slander my school's name. I may be on my way out of high school, but I haven't forgotten how to read phony people and their thoughts like they've been published on the front page of a newspaper. I'm going to tell you about these shady individuals AND my school, and I GUARANTEE this is the last comment you will have to read. I'm not like other people who won't respond to these negative things said about my school, because when they talk about my school, they are essentially talking about me, the students who graduated before me, AND the students in grades below me as well, and my teachers who truly care. If you are going to throw shade at my school, I WILL ECLIPSE YOU. It's funny how they can say all these things over the internet, and in Julianna's case, play victim every time they got into an altercation. I was in Julianna's class while she was attending this school, and I can attest that EVERY problem she had with ANYBODY in this school was a result of her unpleasant attitude and demeanor.The very way she talked to me and others around me sent off unpleasant vibes. She came from an area where that kind of attitude was accepted, and expected her ways to be accepted when she came to YECA. It was literally like she expected the world to stop when she had a problem. She claims that the administration blamed her for her ""bullying"" when she literally accosted people daily! I guess they were wrong for seeing through her BS. As for John Doe, I have no idea what GPS told him to come for my dear Principal Burnett-Worthy, BUT HE BETTER REROUTE. How dare he come sideways at her or any other administrator in my school about ""fake smiles"" FROM BEHIND A COMPUTER SCREEN?! John Doe AND Julianna ARE THE LAST, and I repeat, LAST people that you should EVER come to when having a question about MY school. Julianna was here for ONE year and left when she couldn't get things to go the way SHE wanted them to. She needs to save the BS for Bank of America because it will buy her NOTHING here. And don't believe her when she says she didn't intend to bash my school. If her experience was that bad, she wouldn't even be thinking of searching YECA up to leave her unimportant thoughts in the comment section. And yes, I said UNIMPORTANT. My classmates can tell you that she is only to be forgotten like forget-me-nots. AND John Doe? First of all, it's common sense to NEVER take advice from anyone who can't post their own name in a COMMENT Section, let alone someone whose only experience with YECA seems to be from him sitting down and watching the 24 hour news channel which is likely the only channel he has beside PBS. I mean, HE CAN'T EVEN SPELL ""principal"" or ""jeopardy"" RIGHT! I have been at this school since, September of 2009, and I will be supporting my high school, which is practically where I've spent almost half of my life up to this point, long after I graduate this June. So, if you have any concerns about sending your child here, YOU TAKE IT FROM ME. My teachers were always dedicated and they cared about EACH and EVERY one of us. Due to my school's teachings, I was able to score a 1970 out of 2400 on my SAT on the first try, and one of my classmates bested me with a 2040 on his SAT on his second try. For Christ sakes, we've had students that graduated from here get accepted into IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS such as Princeton! Let Julianna and John say what they want, but frankly, I don't care. As I said before, I've been here from the jump in 6th Grade, and I will continue to support my school long after I graduate in June. Take it from me, this school is more than great, and so is it's staff. If John Doe wants to come back and talk his trash about a school he's never been to, I WILL be waiting.

YECA was not a good fit for me, it may have been a good fit for you and that's wonderful.

It's very unfortunate that you believed that I asked for it, your words ""simply because you asked for it"".  No one asks to be bullied and it's attitudes like yours that cause thousands of teenagers to commit suicide each year.  Bullying is a serious offense and should never be taken lightly.  Due to my experience you automatically assumed that I was a bad student, for the record, I was on the Honor Roll and the Principal's Honor Roll at ""your"" school and continues to do so at my current high school.  My education is and has always been my number one priority.  My intention, Mekai Twix Ruddock, is not to bash your school but to share my experience and another perspective.

28Q284,Grandchampion,queens,Middle,290,"I am saddened to hear such a horrible statement about York Early College Academy (YECA).  I have taught at schools where students fight or cut and watched people look the other way. YECA is NOT that type of school at all.  Daily attendance is mandatory for all class periods and when students are out the attendance personnel is contacted immediately.  One may think that because of the location of the school that violence is a problem, but itâs not at all!  Our students are scholars! Students compete with each other to achieve high grades, hold positions of leadership within school clubs, and complete their community service requirements. We are a small learning community of dedicated students, faculty, staff and administration.  You know youâre in a great school when several staff member send their own children to the school, collaborate during their time off, and maintain strong relationships with studentsâ families.  There is constant communication between parents, teachers, students, and in some cases tutors that support students as well. The one thing I must say though is if you want to succeed there as a student or member of the faculty, then you must be consistent and have a strong work ethic. There is a clear vision stressed upon by the Administration Team made up of Ms. Worthy and Mr. Angeles that all students can not only graduate high school and attend college, but that all students attending YECA have an open gateway to master their course work during High School to adequately prepare them for their college courses.  Our students not only graduate with advance regents diplomas, and college credits that in most cases are in excess of 60 credits, but our students graduate knowing that they are forever a part of a network whose main objective is to support their academic and career goals.

For the past 2 years I have continuously received letters from colleges expressing their interest in me based on my academic achievements at YECA.  When it comes to cutting school and fighting YECA may have a hand full of instances but nothing compared to other NYC high schools. We are a family, you know everyone and everyone knows you. We do not tolerate bullying, anything of that nature is simply because you asked for it. We work together to achieve the success that we want. So unlike the few students like the one who posted below.  So if your interested in a good education and a good school, I say apply.

28Q284,Rosenia C. Pangan,queens,Middle,290,"Relatively new but definitely one of the best schools in Queens. I am so proud that my children went there for Middle School. The Principals, Deans, Teachers and other staff are very professional yet friendly in handling and dealing with the day to day issues of the students. I hope and pray that YECA will have its own building someday rather than sharing the building with 2 other schools. They so deserve it.

I highly recommend this school if you want quality education for your kids. I've proven it because my son who is a graduate of YECA and is now a HS Freshman at Brooklyn Tech is coping very well - socially and academically.  My son would have definitely stayed in YECA if he did not pass the SHSAT. 

More power to Principal Deborah Burnett-Worthy, Asst. Principal Noah Angeles and the rest of the YECA team. Thank you for instilling in our children the value of education and that they are not only High School bound but also College-bound.

The school has many resources as a whole, everyone is a family. However, I have one complaint. This generally goes for all the schools in JHS. The security guards at scanning are nasty. They are rude and prejudice. I fondly remember one asking a foreigner if he knew English quite rudely as he didn't understand the security guard. They are a bunch of covetous and ignorant people. They go bizerk over anything if something like a book looks like a weapon they have you take it out and go through scanning again.  I prefer to keep my anonymity, but these security guards are quite nasty. Only two seem kind here. The rest are lazy,prejudice as I said before, and lastly not cut out for the job.

Honestly, I have been here and the whole month of September and the first couple of weeks on October we did not have a hospital teacher. Students have told me that they NEVER went to the hospital, students who've been to the school since 7th grade. The school barely has any activities and its boring. Going to the school feels like a jail, and I am being very blunt. I have about 7 teachers, not including my gym teacher. Out of all of them, only 3 of them can teach. Mrs Yilmaz, Mr John, and Mrs Gartner are excellent teachers! Any how, the rest of them do not have a good teaching strategy. A lot of the teachers in the school are disorganized and lose homework, or expect to have homework assignments they never mentioned. Not only are a lot of them disorganized, but they can be inconsiderate. You could be as smart as Einstein, and still manage to get an 80 average due to unorganized teachers. Many teachers play favorites as well. Also, the majority of the people in the school complain about it. Honestly, I as a student, do not feel welcome or apart of the school.

28Q680,guest347,queens,Middle,285,"I recently entered this school, I am in the 9th grade. I applied to this school because I heard that they hadÂ a profound hospital program. Unfortunately, when I started school, there was no hospital teacher for the whole month ofÂ September. My current hospital teacher does not teach much in class, she hands us homework assignments without teaching us the material. The teacher had told us that we will be able to go over to theÂ Queens General hospital, which is located right next door, but weÂ still have not been over there and I doubt we ever will be going.Â Despite my view on the hospital program, I LOVE chemistry.Â My teacher's name is Ms. Yilmaz and IÂ love her teaching methods.Â HerÂ class notes are veryÂ thorough and she always reviews for an upcoming test or quiz. We have labs almost every week and the experiments are very interesting, as well as engaging. As for my english teacher, I feel like he could make his lessons more engaging. For me, literature is supposed to be something that capitivates your mind. For geometry, I take a lot of notes, and the tests are pretty fair as long as you study. My geometry teacher does explain to us the material we do not understand and she encourages us to ask questions. As for the school itself, Gateway is very clean, there's never trash in the hallways or discarded food in the staircase. In the morning when you enter the building you have to swipe your student I.D. card. I think that there should be more activities open for students. Overall, Gateway is a very welcoming environment and for the most part, the teachers are very friendly and teach really well.

Yes, there are some teachers who aren't committed, but I will reasonably say they're beat 99/1.Â  The administration, teachers and yes, even the security are all for the kids - hey if you do wrong, thats your choice, suffer the consequences - I believe, the faculty and staff are here to make sure our kids stay on the right track.
I can understand, that the lack of sports is a big deterrent, we all know there isn't a lot ofÂ space;Â but maybe with more help from parents something could be done, theres a lot ofÂ field in the area, Cunningham Park for one.Â

We now have a Rugby team and there will most likely be more sport teams added in the future. I would say the teacher-student relationships are healthy, and although the workload may seem overwhelming at times, it is good practice and puts you ahead of the other students in most city public schools. There are lockers in the hallways, but as someone before me said, there is limited access to them (you can, however, get away with this if you really need something). The intermingling of middle school and high school students may definitely feel out of the ordinary to some, maybe even annoying, but for the most part people get along with each other and there are no fights/bullying/harm to worry about. I would suggest to anyone interested in applying to this school to schedule a visit or a tour to see the high school for yourself.

28Q896,MamaQueens11432,queens,Middle,248,"As a honest person I will start with the positive aspects of this school. The premise is a supportive atmosphere for girls, that otherwise they may not get in an co-ed setting. However, as the child transitions from middle school to high school this is where the school does not live up to its merits. There is no concrete plan to tackle bullying, and as a result this school year there has been many fights. I am unsure as to why they have been so many physical altercations but it would seem the school does not either. Last school year as a parent I was very upset to learn that my daughter was allowed to watch a movie in her classroom as part of the lesson they were doing that week. However, the teacher carelessly allowed an inappropriate scene to be showed that show a man and a women engaging in cardinal behavior. I found out about this now through the school or the teacher but by my daughter it seems that she was looking for the movie on her Netflix account as I heard her friends discussing it. I understand mistakes do happen but being that this school has such a ""high reputation"" I'm beginning to wonder what else is going on that parents do not know about. Another situation that caused me to scratch my head is dismay is when another school employee allowed a student to help sort report cards. The students being privy to this information started bullying another student about her poor grades. Another concerned parent told me about this and once again I was in shock. I can only report on the experiences that I have had in this school. If I had a choice I would have had my daughter transfer to another school, but the Board of Education has strict rules about transfers.

I have to say as a current middle school student there is a lot of drama but you can't escape it at any school you'll always be with petty girls you just got to know when to stay out of it cause then you'll be at fault also. The school doesn't offer many clubs but what they do offer I guarantee your child will have fun. They have a rock band where you can learn to play instruments. You have cheerleading and more. We have a brother school also known as Eagle Academy which is an all boys school on Merrick Blvd that we have many events with such as dances and prom. I can admit that you make some really good friends with eagle sometimes many of use become more than friends. You have many opportunities for you daughter but you always got to work for them because they don't get handed to you. This school is a uniform school that I can say has really expensive uniform that you have to buy from Flynn and O'harra. The teachers are always there for you they offer tutoring on Tuesdays. One thing that does need to be improved is when there is a problem you don't always get help. They do need more clubs and more uniform choices.

28Q896,Alexa,queens,Middle,248,"My daughter has been attending this school since middle school, and I have enough right to say that this school is absolutely terrible.

Do not make your daughter apply for this school in middle school, or high school.
You might think that this school is great for your daughter because it's a same sex school, but being same sex doesn't make a school magically superior to co ed ones.

The girls in this school are just as nasty as boys. They're extremely rude, mean, and sly. My daughter came home many days, crying, and whenever we went to complain about this to the dean or guidance counselor, they didn't help at all, even though each and every time the other person was clearly the attacker. Why? Because my daughter wasn't of the race this school favors.

The dean is absolutely useless. My daughter told me about how she saw students fighting, pulling each other's hair, rolling on the ground, throwing food, and ruining each other's properties countless days during lunch. The dean doesn't notice any of this, and went on to punish these friends who were playfully slapping each other.

There was even a period of months where the school had assigned seating for lunch. That is absurd. There's students who have bad vibes towards each other, and they were told to sit next to each other. The students got assigned seats, because the grades that had lunch prior left trash and food all around the cafeteria, and certain tables in my daughter's lunch period were full of dirty people who didn't bother to take care of their own trash, and that is why people who're always doing their duty had to be punished as well as the ones at fault. They said this was to build teamwork. I don't know how such a bad school could build teamwork with such bad methods. Worst of all, my daughter asked a lowerclassman if they had assigned seats for lunch, and they didn't. Guess what? They were students from the lunch period prior my daughter's; the ones who made the cafeteria dirty originally.

The guidance counselor never helps resolve problems. She instigates them.

The staff don't even know about their own school. I asked the school's parent coordinator about my aris parentlink password which I forgot, and she said she doesn't know what that is, and how to do that.

It makes my daughter miserable every day. They first thing she says after coming home each day is ""Mother, I don't want to go to school tomorrow."" I know it isn't a joke, because she's not one to complain about things unless they really, really pain her.

The old principal most likely got demoted from a principal in TYWLS to a dean in another, because her title as principal was nothing. Every time she made an announcement, it was barely audible. She favored students for their race, and invited them to eat lunch with her. 

The new principal doesn't do much either.

The school is miniscule. Every time my daughter changes classes, there are horrible traffic jams on the stairs where the ruder and students of larger mass trample over the ones saying excuse me, and make them late for class.

The French teacher is oblivious to this, and disgustingly scolds students who tried, and got trampled in the stairs coming from the basement to the third floor and were seconds late. The students who can't see from the back aren't given a seat in the front in her classroom as well.

The school is tardy with things.

When my daughter entered high school, she wasn't even invited to the orientation. She couldn't get her uniform, and was scolded for it, even though the school was at fault.

The students received their official schedules late. There were four switches in the schedule. The students had to come over and over to the school during their precious vacation to get schedules that weren't even official. Even on the first day of school, there were schedule issues. It's been more than a week since school started, and many students still have incorrect schedules.

Last year, the official honors class started two months late because the school was too stupid to sort itself out, and made the new honors students miss two months of precious Regent's preparation. My daughter's friend, who's a grade below her, got low nineties for her math and earth science regents, when she could've gotten a 100.

The school also doesn't offer English honors classes, unlike the other schools in New York.

The supplies in this school are barbaric. There are no smartboards that function, while in other schools, whiteboards and chalkboards have become ancient things after the introduction of the smartboard. The school didn't get any textbooks for many of the classes at all last year. My daughter had to pass her exams with only her personal notes, which luckily, are very good, if I do say so myself.

The teachers seem to be rookies. They treat the talented students like they're the only people who exist in the classroom, and don't even try to make the less gifted students any smarter. They forget things often, and take absences like it's nothing. They also pair up the smarter students with the not-so-smart and not-so-effort-giving students, and in the end, that one smart kid in the group ends up doing all the work for her group of 5 imbeciles, and we all know group projects aren't small things.

Many teachers keep quitting over the years, and the new ones are usually just as bad. The phys ed teachers barely let the students move around in the school's tiny gym. (Oh, did I mention that this school has no auditorium, so the dances, graduation ceremonies, and some of the morning meetings are held in the gym? The others are held in the cafeteria or library.) Last year, the students with gym took their phys ed classes in the cafeteria and library. Doesn't this come off as absurd to you?

This school has barely any AP courses, and they're only available in 11th grade. This makes the students of this school inferior to the students who have AP's in 9th and 10th grade. There are also barely any clubs, so the students aren't given many fun opportunities. Barely any trips as well. 

There are many other problems in this school. I'm currently regretting not letting my daughter attend the other schools she got accepted to because I preferred same sex education. I'm trying my best to help her transfer out of this hell of a school, and if you parents who have daughters attending and feel the same as me about this school, transfer your daughters quickly before they lose a chance to get into those Ivy Leagues we wanted them to attend since birth.",0,2,0,2014-09-13T18:56:18,0.75,0.016,0.141,0.004,0.079,0.073,0.5,0.42700000000000005,0.379,0.129,0.016,0.04
