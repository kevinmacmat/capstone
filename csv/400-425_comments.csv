12X316,Jonathan Cruz,bronx,Middle,387,"This school is horrible. Don't go. I'm now in my senior year here, and the senior trip is horrible. They are going to send us to the 9/11 memorial, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and a dinner at Dave and Busters for 100 dollars for a senior trip. That has to be the worst senior trip ever, also with the new principal who used to be the assistant principal, the school is running out of money. Spanish class has been dropped, Music has been dropped for 8th grade, Health has been dropped, and we barely have any space. You carry a BUNCH of stuff every day for school, and get yelled at every morning when we line up in the gym before school stars. The assistant principal just yells at us for like ten minutes, and we have to do drills like army soldiers. The school probably isn't #1 in the District anymore, even if so District 12 is horrible, so it isn't hard to be #1 in it. The teachers have problems with fellow teachers, (which we have to call professors) and they occasionally talk bad about other teachers. ELA is the same thing every year in Kappa III, Science is alright, in Social Studies you learn the same thing every year. Math is complicated, and not explained well. Do NOT go to this school, you will regret it. The cafeteria is horrible as well, and it's crowded with 2 grades in the cafeteria, and we barely go outside because if a student does something wrong, everyone gets blamed for it. The motto is ''It's we not me in Kappa III.'' Unless you want to learn absolutely nothing and spend the most useless years of your life with a HORRIBLE senior trip, don't go here. We only have like 1 trip a year as well, and that's on the yellow school bus. The only good trip I recall was going to six flags but only our class got it because we won a competition. The teachers are also BLIND in this school and DEAF. Students cuss a lot behind the teachers backs (literally) and hit other students right in front of the teacher's eyes and get away from it. This school is HORRIBLE, and is BROKE, and you will hate it here. The people you meet here are really cool, but some of them are really annoying as well. The neighborhood is horrible, and is really poor. You will probably get chased a couple of times, and possibly jumped if you say the wrong thing. It's also very unfair in the school because people who skip class ALL THE TIME and who cheat in exams and projects always get the Gold Honor Roll (95% average or above) or the Silver or Bronze honor roll. It's really unfair, but since they cheat on everything they get a free pass through junior high school. The school is only 2% White, and 2% Asian. So if you're white or Asian prepare to get made fun of. If any one of your parents are middle class, you will have to pay for lunch, every day. There's no sports clubs in the school, besides nyjtl         (New York Junior Tennis League) which you have to stay until like 5:30 and you barely do any tennis, and they never win ANYTHING. The school is just a horrible experience, 80% of the teachers are useless, but some of the teachers are really good. I wouldn't recommend to go to this school, it's really bad, and we don't even have lockers. We don't even have desks to store our stuff in or anything. We have to carry a bunch of stuff in our bookbags, including our binders. It's horrible. There's no school plays, and you're never in the auditorium because it's shared by 4 DIFFERENT SCHOOLS! Don't apply for this school, it's very bad in my opinion. Classes keep getting dropped, no trips, horrible teachers, barely any space, bad after school programs, poor environment, and no extracurricular activities. I can't wait to graduate, even though the graduate is going to be horrible and the senior trip makes no sense.

Information regarding activities in the school is sent home the day before giving parents no advance notice to  plan accordingly.  The school want the kids to do the Specialize HS Test, but has only started the classes 4 wks prior to the test giving only 2 classes per week and parents have to pay out of pocket. There is no summer school period for KAPPA III. The students are not polished and the teachers seem weary of them.  Prof. Joyce the Science teacher is a wonderful person, I observe him interacting with the kids outside of the classroom setting, just a wonderful man.  Overall I think parents should think twice about sending their child to this school.

Went on their senior trip over night to Niagara falls and once the kids were in the hotel the principal and several other chaperones went out drinking leaving the students unattended.

The hotel manager had to call the principal of @MSTAPrincipal on his personal cell phone so he can come back and resolve the situation.  I bring this to light because the school and some of the same chaperones will be attending another over night trip this year to Washington DC and I am concerned because I witnessed this first hand.

Upon his graduation he was invited to attend some of NYC's most renowned programs - Medgar Ever's Prep, Prep for Prep, private school De LaSalle Academy, Phillipa Schuyler M.S. And Mark Twain for the Gifted and Talented. 

Socially, he went from a shy and withdrawn student to one with an offbeat sense of humor that he loves to share. The friendships that he's made are continuing through phone calls, emails and visits. I thank the teachers that realized who he was inside and helped him bring it out. The various arts programs that P.S. 3 invite into the school as well as take the students to visit have added another dimension to him. Those experiences allow my son to fit comfortably into his new school's setting. Concerts and museums are second nature to him. Although I was sometimes uncomfortable with what appeared to a chaotic lunch or dismissal time, there was always an adult who could readily explained what was happening.
