Anyone in the Lewis academy will get annoyed with whole Eagle thing because of how the bathroom schedules are but that won't really be a problem. 

When i went to this school i have not seen any gangs around especially since i was apart of the Student Dean program. The school has a friendly feeling but some people there have some nasty attitudes so be prepared. it's a great school overall, but not for people who 'crack' easily.

29Q109,AriGeeksAlot -_-,queens,Middle,1164,"I'm currently a student in the 8th grade and doing online learning. Most of these comments are old so i thought i should do this for the incoming 6th graders in 2020. 109 isn't that bad. The teachers in 6th grade help but after that your on your own. The teachers expect you to know stuff you might not know. I'd say at least there's 1 or 2 bad teachers for each grade. They're usually older. The 7th grade art teacher looks and acts like shes on drugs but dont take her serious, kids mess with her a lot like kicking her door and making fun of her ( I dont judge them, i was one of them :/ )  When i came into 109 i was super scared and a completely different person then i am today. 109 changed me, not just physically but mentally. I was able to take insults better and i learned to ignore those people who are miserable and take it out on you. Like every other school there's drama but please dont get involved in it. Every like month there's a real fight ( Sometimes in schools most of the time its not ) Most of the fights in school are fake fights with the boys to see whos stronger. My best advice is to mind you business, don't talk bad about anyone AT ALL!!!! (You will get jumped or beat up),  do your work on time and please for the love of god take a shower everyday wash your hair and clothes and wear deodorant ( and maybe cologne or perfume ) Reply if you want more info on other things in 109. I'm going to Queens High School of Teaching, Liberal Arts, & The Sciences. I recommend it.

29Q109,Shaen,queens,Middle,1164,"Terrible school staff, they have nothing organized, they barely ever do any real work yet still complain. The only helpful people actually working in the school are the deans, guidance counselors and a handful of teachers. The young teachers are great, very helpful and teach with a positive attitude every day and keep up with the students while the older teachers have problems disciplining the students and all they care about is getting their pay checks and going home (I've over heard them shouting it at most of the students). The school needs a lot of work with the school security and the students safety in and outside of school in my opinion. Also, people need to learn to respect personal space in that school. The real problems is how the school is run and how the way it affects the students. Reminder: Every school has it's ups and downs and this school is no different though I would not recommend this school to most people only if it were their last resort. The environment in this school is not very inspiring for the students, and kids need some thing to boost them to learn not just ""they need to pass"" and parents need to learn that. Another downside to this school is their lacking of detecting bullying when it's right on Their faces, that's why a few years ago a student had committed suicide after being bullied at school and online (there was a leaked video of the students fighting as well) ",0,0,0,2015-09-21T02:05:28,0.5,0.07,0.162,0.054000000000000006,0.897,0.063,0.496,0.321,0.405,0.183,0.033,0.205

The teachers that I had were very caring teachers. They always pushed me to do my best and to give my full effort in every assignment or task I did. The staff at school were also very caring, there were moment where I didn't feel comfortable speaking to a teacher about something so I would speak to either my guidance counsel or another adult at school. My advice to a person going to this school is to one try to get into the SP (honors) program and to try and stay away from all the drama and gossip.

29Q109,Miss. StudentA,queens,Middle,1164,"Okay, so the reviews and information about this school are EXTREMELY old. I am currently an eighth grader in the SP (Honors) program. This school is big, 5 floors, no escalators. There is tons of walking up stairs, especially to the girls gym. The boy's gym is HUGE, spacious, with a big nice locker room. The girls gym is small, kind of dirty I guess, with a crammed locker room. You will get used to it and learn to 'love' it, but it takes some time to adjust. The teachers are AWESOME, but the administration is confusing. You will most likely not be very fond of your assistant principals, but the Deans and Counselors are going to be the greatest, hard working people you'll ever meet...especially Dean Clark. As for being in the honors program, it is a BLESSING. The teachers are wonderful and the amount of work and challenges you can face are great. The environment is totally different from the rest of the school and you get so many privileges...such as going on trips and being treated specially. I actually feel super prepared for the competitive high school I plan going to. As for everyone else, its average. You just have to accept the craziness of everyone else and move on. There are RARELY fights and as long as you mind your own business, you can make great friends. We have an iMac LAB with Ms. Symmonds, who is the coolest teacher ever. After school, we have the beacon program open to everyone. It has some really good options. There is NO MORE pre nursing or pre engineering. We just have four core subjects, technology, gym, language, and enrichment courses due to budget cuts. In eighth grade, you have the opportunity to take several regents exams as honors students. I am part of the ARISTA community this year and cannot wait to graduate. These 3 years are a huge life changing experience, where you learn the academic and social aspects of life.

29Q132,Haecoumi,queens,Elementary,331,"When was the last time this review was updated? Firstly I am a parent with a son who attends this school right now, and little of this report is accurate. I am desperately trying to get him out of this placement. The neighborhood is unsafe. The ""children learn to speak Chinese"" has NOT taken place in YEARS (not since the former principal left. Said principal is also now retiring (from ANOTHER school), so that SHOWS you how long ago such a program took place). There is no longer a ""strong"" reading program as BOTH ""Reading Specialist"" were placed in the classroom as homeroom teachers by the new principal. My son has one such ""reading specializing"" teacher now in 1st grade--I am not impressed. 

In addition to the woman having zero control within her class, zero parent-teacher communicative abilities and zero classroom handling aptitude; she also has little patience with the students. My son if anything has become a WORSE reader from what I have seen (meaning the woman has undone even the general basic skills I and his Kindergarten teacher instilled). Furthermore, her class is so noisy that my son complains of it (this from a child who can watch SPONGEBOB and the TRANSFORMERS cracked up to near deafening levels no problem). According to he and other students his teacher ""screams all the time"" and ""no ever is quiet"" in the classroom.Honestly, I would have to say the ""bullying"" is probably the biggest problem at the school. The Principal is not addressing it AT ALL--as a matter of fact even letters to her office go UNATTENDED to! My son has come home numerous time with ""accidents"" that I was neither contacted about or had my questions answered about. Also, there is some kind of weird picking order as well. . . Parents who are known trouble makers are the ones whose badly behaved children are allowed to run rampant over the quieter more well-behaved students. I really DO NOT recommend this school!

29Q138,yvette,queens,K-8,672,"It's sad to say, but to put an influential child in this school, is throwing them into the belly of the beast. The teachers have absolutely no control over the behavioral incidents presented to them and appear extremely overwhelmed with the children. Although there may be great kids in that school, the children with disciplinary issues appear to take precedence.  A parent can be called 3 or more times a day, which is ridiculous because at what point is a firm hand or curriculum established between the faculty and the child. I have become quite familiar with the school and its staff and feel a great empathy for them.  Parents need to be held more responsible for the behavior problems or special classes may need to be designed in order for these children to realize that certain behaviors will not be tolerated. All one has to do to assess the actions of activities in this school is take a sneak peek in the cafeteria during lunch time (I have never seen anything like it).  They can also stand outside on the street at dismissal time and boy will they get an eye and earful. Although kids are going to be kids, I would love to turn my back and know that my children are in the hands of professionals that are not afraid of doing their job without biases.

She has made changes in the school that supports teachers being more effective and students love her and the school.  This year parents have become more involved and attended not only special student performances, but also parent workshops to support our children""s learning. This school is working very hard to make progress under the leadership of Mrs. Belcher.  She is a worker and does not even have an assistant principal.  That is a shame when the school was supposed to get help, the board took away even more funds to prevent that. The teachers care more now and it shows.  If the top students are not pulled for charter schools, lottery or gifted and talented then the school won't be struggling.  The parents are supporting our principal, teachers, school and of course our children.  PS 181 is working hard to bounce back and meet the new standards.

The teachers and great and constantly replay to make sure the students understand and they keep contact with parents. For instance my friend her mom has kept contact with our teacher to make sure that my friend is raising her hand asking questions and is always active in whatever lesson we do. The school has lots of fun activities my favorite was last year we had a masquerade ball. As well as Halloween ball. My favorite teacher is Dr. Ross oh man he is amazing he throws parties and goes way out for our classes. You'd expected so little but when you arrive your blown away. He teachers us different topics he brings in animals (beware 50/50 chance they may be dead lol) and he keeps us entertained. I.e he gives us candies or chocolate when we are watching videos on any topic. And during test he plays music for us to calm us down. The one star that missing is because of the students. Some are just how you say problem starters. Like these girl who try their best to bring me and my friends down but they can't even answer a simple question on the board. But the school is great. In a way. The school does lots of fun performances and have cleaned up their old ways. Girls bathrooms now have a pad and tampon dispenser. They are really taking care of us.

I also was chosen among few students to take the Living Environment  Regents which I also passed. Honestly the teachers and staff members try to enforce discipline and respect but it really is the kids who don't care enough to listen. 6th grade year it was fine uniform students weren't as disrespectful. My 7th grade year it started getting stricter consistent hall sweeps, camera's, enforcing dress code etc. 8th grade year the incoming 6th graders were out of control. Cursing out teachers , running the halls . Inappropriate behavior in the stairwell. Always fighting with each other and other schools. Students thinking they were grown and got into physical altercations with Teachers hurting the teachers or injuring themselves. 

There was no parent support. Fashion shows, plays, talent shows students mostly filled the seats. I attended P.T.A. meetings with my mother and there have been times were only a total of 8 to maybe 10 parents showed up. ( no i'm not over exaggerating maybe it improved but I'm unaware if it did.) Not every teacher was perfect some staff members had on again off again attitudes like Ms. Swindell who worked in the main office etc. when I was there. I enjoyed the time I had there and don't regret any of it. No I was not a perfect student like some of these parents a claiming their kids are. I had my flaws etc. But at the end I kept a positive attitude and graduated. I miss the teen center, St. John's after-school and the assistant principal Ms. Smith.

My child unfortunately had to come to this school for the 2010-2011 school year. There are very few good teachers, most of them can care less about their education, and the principal and assistant principal are just rude and disprespectful with the bad students and good students alike.Also for some strange reason, the principal thinks it is ok to spank the students when they are late or out of their uniforms, and they are always full of insults. 

Also I understand that 96% of the students here are African American, and it is important to teach them to be proud of their history, where they came from, how far they have come, However, there are other important people and races who have contributed to this country that they should be learning about as well, but they are not, which I fiind very strange. The other schools my child attended had a great mixture and balance when it came to things like this. There are so many other things that bothered me about this school, but I would be writing for days if I wrote them all. 
Anyway, Im so glad my daughter no longer attends this school.

29Q208,Colletteis40,queens,K-8,714,"Overall this is a wonderful school but this year we have encountered an unusual situation. It is my understanding that the graduating fifth graders are to move over to the middle school, yet they do not have a graduation with a special ceremony. It is also very exciting to see all of the awards that the children receive yet with the awards based on scoring the children who because of needing help have their averages lowered will not receive an award. How would this particular child feel included in the ceremony? Would this child even attend? Or rather, would they already dealing with learning difficulties feel that they are not as good as the rest of the class? If there were only a few awards per class given I could understand but to go from receiving awards every year since first grade to now as a graduating fifth grader receiving none bruises our childrens self esteem. Understanding their needs for extra help should also continue past the end of the school year. What harm is there in celebrating all of the achievements our children have attained? Despite the difficulty school presents to those children that need extra help in class they have succeeded! They are moving on! They deserve to be celebrated and in moving up from fifth grade they will know that hard work pays off.

29Q238,Lily,queens,Middle,1301,"I am now an 8th grader in this school, I've been here since the 6th grade back in 2010. This school is amazing!-- only if you work hard. You only see the amazing part of this school if you truly want to. This school is not at all horrible in anyway, just sort of, what can I say... lacking. Lacking in teacher discipline (most of them need to engage with the students) and in student behavior. I sometimes wonder why students come to school just to fool around, play boyfriend-girlfriend, and don't give a care about their grades and rowdy behavior. I guess it is by law, but there should be better guidance-counslers who can relate to these students instead of suspension here, suspension there. Who am I to complain, I have no idea how hard it is to discipline, I am only an 8th grader. Ever since Mr. Gates left, I had at first felt disappointed, I was looking forward to taking graduation photos with him. He was cool and everyone felt like we were all a big family with him. Due to budget cuts, the promised programs for the 1st floor were cut. I was part of the magazine club and it was hard to move from an absolutely amazing magazine club where we produced our own magazines via an online editor and publishing company. We were moved to ""Creative Writing,"" not exactly horrible but a drastic change from our old elective. Now with Mr. Leddy, he's a great principal so far, don't get me wrong, But I sometimes wonder if all this reaching-out to students is working. He always asks questions during the morning about fun-facts of what happened this very day in history. We are currently in a presidential election right now and I am happy that he has decided to make a student council. To sum it all up, this school is 5 stars for me, maybe it's because I'm biased since I've been here for a full 3 years now but it's just my opinion. I've met countless teachers who have done their job well here. I've learned so many things, gained strength in many of my weak subjects, and have improved my self as a student. Now that I'll be graduating in June 2013, leaving this school will be a bit saddening, but hopefully the new batch of students will keep this place running well and keeping it's high reputation as a public middle school up there.",4,0,0,2012-10-01T23:35:43,0.5,0.163,0.14300000000000002,0.040999999999999995,0.495,0.183,0.648,0.295,0.355,0.281,0.02,0.284

29Q270,PS270Q parent ,queens,K-8,733,"This school needs new leadership.  It is fine that the principal Chayvonne Harper and her two assistant principals are nice, and give off the appearance of efficiency and effectiveness.  In actually, it has not been proved to come to fruition.  My children attended this school from K-8, having the experience of both the previous principal Ms. Andrews, and the changes under Ms. Harper.  We have also experienced the same under the previous assistant principals and the new.  When your staff ""flees"" -- leaves in exodus -- that is a sign.  When some of your staff live in the area and are familiar with the community, the kids, etc. - that is also great -- but don't send their children to this school -- that is also a sign. (Maybe they don't want to be with their children all day; but, if this was a truly ""great"" school, they'd have them their with no problem.)  The biggest issues with the administration is lack there of.  There is very little follow-up and follow through.  When one child was ""moving up"" to 6th grade, the assistant principal sent a notice home requesting that all children show up in their Sunday best.  She showed up in ripped jeans and a t-shirt.  

Let's talk academics.  In relation to many schools across NYC, you have teachers who are their to teach and lead, and others their for the paycheck, the summer off, and the knowledge they can't be fired. That is evident in the lack of challenging work presented in many of the subjects.  Many people posted about a particular math teacher -- that teach remains inadequate, inefficient and ill-equipped.  She also remains a teacher in this school.  Also in relation to many schools across NYC, you will have students who shine! They are innately curious, and thereby studious and they excel and would excel no matter their circumstance or surrounding.  For the rest of the students who require focused, broken-down, explicitly explained curriculums, that will be a challenge to locate here.  The teachers appear to be on a scheduled agenda to get in a specified amount of work in a specified amount of time.  If your child is not picking up those lessons within that time-frame, they will be left behind, because the class must move on. With regard to the mention of the music teacher as mentioned below -- my children learned the recorder for 4 years - a purchase the parent has to make.  There are very few if any other instruments.  My children never returned home with an art project. 

Let's talk physical space.  The building is approximately 10-15 years old - and yet last required a completely new roof.  The gym is built for kids no older than 6th grade, yet the space is occupied with 8th graders (experiencing growth sprouts and body development).  The space was not built with middle schoolers in mind, and has not been adapted for such.  (There was a child who had to be sawed out of a desk, lawsuit pending).  There are no lockers in the school - so children must carry every book they own, and wear their coats all day through out the weather appropriate months. Retro-fitting of lockers, at least for the 60 or so kids in middle school is physically possible, but questionable if fiscally possible. 

I used INSIDE SCHOOLS to help locate a school for my children to transfer to.  I see their work in investigating every school with credibility, especially as I've met in person the leader of the organization.  Comments shouldn't be all negative but they should share the concerns -- which is what a parent what's to know honestly if they are on this site.  So, PS270Q has a very caring PTA, has ""nice"" teachers and administrative staff.  But if you want a great education for your child(ren) this should not be your first choice (or second).",0,0,0,2019-08-23T12:52:26,0.75,0.005,0.162,0.052000000000000005,0.6579999999999999,0.04,0.379,0.005,0.951,0.026000000000000002,0.001,0.13

The other instruments mentioned were rented by students who were interested in learning them.  All students in middle school were asked if they wanted to rent instruments and participate in the concert band.  It would have been an unfair financial burden to insist that all families go out and rent an instrument that could cost $100 or more.

29Q270,A.C.P.,queens,K-8,733,"Most of the comments below are from either paretns or teachers and are really OLD. From a graduated students perspective the school has changed alot. I had gone to P.S./I.S. 270q for 9 years, from k-8th. I was with the group of kids that filled the school for its third year opened. Now I have watched principals change, colors of the building completely change, teachers leave, teachers have heart attacks; basically, I have watched the school and staff members go through thick and thin. For any child or teenager this school is a learning experinece from kindergarten till Graduation. Some of the comments are true about the teachers being rough; but, what parent doesnt want their child to have a teacher that will push them to their limits and sky high so they can succeed. Also, yes the homework is tough and they give it to you on a daily or in Middle School weekly. What the homework will do for your child in Kindergarten - 5th grade is drill the work into them so that they are prepared for what the Middle School teachers will give them. The Middle School teachers do not teach these children second grade Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies or in any subject. All of these teachers are professionals and have so many degress with years of experince added along that it would be hard for them to teach your children second grade math. Regarding the lunch situation, wehn I was younger Mrs. Andrews always had something for us little kids to do when we wanted to ""releave stress"". During the Fall, Spring, and Summer time all of the kids would be outside in the playground which was desginated for specific grades. The larger yard was for 5th-8th grade and the smaller yard was for K-4th, which has been changed with the new Principal Ms. Chayvonne Harper. She has had all of the children ampile time to play and enjoy their time on the larger yard. During the Winter and on rainy days, Mrs. Andrews had the younger children read books or watch television in the cafeteria. While Middle School students had opportunites to either stay in the lunch room and talk with their friends, go to the library and read there, aska teacher for permission to stay in their room and assist or do whatever work they have to do, and even the Gym teacher takes time from her lunch to have the children compete intheir own basketball games, volleyball games, or just play a sport. Mrs. Harper has still instilled quite a few of Mrs. Andrews techniques and has added more safety to it. Since in the past children would sneak out and hang out in stair cases there have been more security added to the lunch room. This incoming fall take a look inside the cafeteria and you will see children definetley letting off steam. Regarding the curiculum your students will definetley encounter some teachers their not gonna like but who ever had the perfect group of teachers with the most wonderful attitude. Honestly speaking, the school has definetely changed since Mrs.Andrews left in a negative and poistive way. Mrs.Harper is trying to do thhe best she can with students rebelling against her and the new rules she is trying to instil and learning the ropes of how all of the childrena re acustom to learning when Mrs.Andrews was her. Mrs. Allen, the assistant principal, is doing all she can too. She has been with the school from the ground up. Starting as a technology teacher and now the assistant principal. She does really well with the new children and the kids that have been with the school for years. So right now, most of the comments bbelow this are all wrong and its either your children aren't giving you the truth or you the ""students"" need to take time to know the schools history like i do and understand every aspect of it; including teachers, administrators,staff members, and members of the PTA before you complain about how terrible the school is.",2,0,0,2013-08-02T03:24:45,0.75,0.005,0.162,0.052000000000000005,0.6579999999999999,0.04,0.379,0.005,0.951,0.026000000000000002,0.001,0.13

No bullying in this school the years i have been there. The principle and the teachers are cool and they know all the students by their name. its a writing based school. But it offers lots of other classes.

29Q283,A Student From PAW,queens,Middle,207,"to all the people who are saying PAW is bad...SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!! You people don't know a great school when you see one. The new principal is awesome. When you have a problem he will take time out of his day to listen and solve the problem. He knows every student by name and can tell you what their grades are. This principal doesn't sit up in his office like a snobby executive, but actually visits classrooms and helps students with their classwork. The activities he plans are great...paintball, dodgeball, game shows, indoor carnivals are only some of the activities. We have great advisories and few but great extra curricular activities such as Rachel's challenge, PAW players(a acting group), Improv, PAW Leadership Academy, Literary Magazine, Newspaper, Fashion and Fashion Magazine, and Students Government. The uniform is strict but you are allowed to wear black or khaki jeans, any kind of green, white, or black shirt as long as it doesn't have alot of graphics on it. The discipline system is also strict, but once you get a taste of it, you stop acting out alot and there are less disruptions in the classroom. Also, the teachers are adequately preparing us for the standardized test and regents. But guess what, 8th graders are allowed to take up to three regents before they get to high school (Earth Science, United States History, and Integrated Algerbra). They prepare us for those also. Our principal has also implemented a rather unorthodox way of helping the students pass all the classes. Its called Academic Probation and it is really making less students fail.  As for writing, we have to write in journals for every subject, which allows us to share our thoughts. The classes have lots of discussions and the students rotate through the work while helping each other in a nondisruptive manner. The teachers are kind and always willing to help. Most have much patience for those who are struggling and those who are very disruptive, which is very few. I have never seen a principal that is so down to Earth with the students. The school is very seperated from the other schools in terms of interactions. Most of the kids that are from the other schools in the building keep to themselves and most times you can't really hear them in the hallway. The scanning room and the metal detectors help ensure that the younger kids in the building are very safe. There is very little fighting at the school since our new principal and the other schools are buckling down as well. Preparatory Academy has turned its fate around and has finally earned its title as a College Board School. It is time that people start realizing this and start giving PAW the respect it deserves. PAW is better than what the surrounding schools have to offer. And as being a student there I can give a testimonial at any time to its progressive ways. Although I am leaving to go to The Brooklyn Latin School, I will never forget the way PAW has changed me. It changed me from a very shy and quiet person to a very eloquent leader that has taken charge of my education and now has the highest GPA in the whole school. If you are considering this school, you should choose to go to it. From the past to now, it turned from the school for the delinquents of Queens to a school that nurtures the academically gifted, and that is something to applaud. ",0,0,0,2012-03-28T21:51:04,0.5,0.039,0.179,0.043,0.086,0.106,0.45399999999999996,0.034,0.889,0.063,0.01,0.076

PAW set the examples for how the other schools shall be, and thanks to the Principal, it will be like that for a while. There are consequences, and rules for ever wrong behavior. The teachers are on top of students work and making sure each student receives the education they need. The students of PAW knows more about the school than the parents do. Thanks to PAW, PAW shall set examples for most schools in the neighborhood. I would love for parents to know this ""A good school is a school with discipline, consequences and education.""

29Q356,School Stud,queens,Middle,347,"Some of this review is wrong. If you are reading this, you are being fed bad information. This is coming from a student here. This is experience. This is the truth.

First off, we barely focus on community service. Did you know that the minute we were assigned our homeroom classes we had to ""not waste a single moment"" and launch ourselves into books and ""instructional time?"" And on the one day of the school year where we go to the park to pick up garbage, the teachers just allow the kids to play around and put branches in garbage bags or something. 

Next, there is favoritism. To the extreme.That's self explanatory. If a person who is a favorite is rudely talking when they aren't supposed to, don't expect them to get in trouble, or even a failing grade. In the end, they have a reputation for being a ""good influence"" and even get 95 grades and higher, while everyone else is trying much harder and ending up with 70s and 80s, then being called ""dumb."" Yeah, they call us dumb. 

We have no honors class, so gifted kids beware. We had one for a year, and I was in the honors program, but they basically skipped the whole 7th grade curriculum and went to 8th grade. And who can forget that annoying pressure we got:""Oh, you're the smartest class! So you set the example! So that means get the highest scores! Donate the highest in the food drive!"" and other things like that. Now, they are saying that we ""set the bar too high for other classes to reach"" and they removed all honors courses. They said we were too smart so we had to lower our standards, pretty much. 

Next, this school is full of crazy kids. Believe me when I say this, because as insane as it sounds, children throw things as light as paper and writing utensils across the room during class to FOOTBALLS. And they jump on desks too! And chase each other! And I lost count to the times when some idiot slapped my rear and ran away, or groped my chest from behind and ran away. And the teachers do nothing about it. All they do is give kids they hate detention. 

I can only speak from the older grades, since I was here when the school first opened to now. Well, we have crappy supplies. I cut my hand multiple times because I was sitting at a broken desk or chair and it just so happened that I had to get something. The textbooks are worn out and most of them were here since 2006! Everything we have is a hand me down from 231. And yet they have the money to get brand new 6th grade supplies only. This school is cheap. 

This school is overcrowded, too, so beware. Advisory consist of at least 30 kids per advisory, who are all rude and ignorant. It also has all the heat in the world and less than half of the rooms have A/C. Oh wait, all the teachers rooms have A/C! Wow! Now what about the kids? 

The thing with clubs in this article is incorrect. We had lots of clubs last year, like cheerleading and step, and less than half of them are still here. We have no tech club. We have no tech. We have no cheerleaders or step team. Our only sports teams are basketball, which is shared campus-wide, and track.

We have a book overload and no lockers. I got back cramps from carrying a 30 pound bag filled to the max with books to and from school each day. As if that's not enough, I carry an additional lunchbox with me holding extra books and papers I need for the day. 

Our lunch period is 15 minutes long, this being both recess and lunch together. I counted it on my watch. 

The most common punishment for misbehaving kids is to walk 3-10 laps in the hallway. I don't even know if that's legal. That hallway is super long and narrow. They actually had 7th graders like me to walk laps in the hallway from 2:30 pm to 3:25 pm, which is dismissal time. Our feet were all cramped up. And that was because the 7th graders transitioned ""noisily"" instead of ""silently and quickly."" This is irritating. Lots of teachers there could really use the exercise instead of yelling at us to stay quiet or we would walk for 10 more minutes. 

We always have to line up in ABC order, which is considerably annoying. Even on trips. 

Too many projects! 

We have a violin in the school logo and no dance or music class. 

These are all the reasons I can think of to stay away from Community Voices. Don't make the same mistake I made. Although Ms. Collins is a pretty friendly principal, there are flaws a plenty in her school. Oh yeah, and Ms. Peters and Ms. Hooks are actually really cool. Most of the other teachers stink at teaching, pick favorites, or do nothing but yell, even if the class is in order. And they overuse that ""Give me 5"" symbol! What makes them think that over 100 kids scattered in a school yard are going to see one teachers hand up, the instantly get in ABC order with their class?

29Q356,School Stud,queens,Middle,347,"Who said anything about strict. Once again, its a matter of if they like you. If they like you, you won't need to lift a finger to get the best average. Just sit back, dont do the work, and play fight during class to get yourself a 95 average. If they dont.... unfortunatly you'll be stuck at lunch detention for picking up a pencil and failing all your classes. All the other kids are really trying but barely passing. 

As for supplies, I must say that it's hard to read a textbook when theres gum all the way back from who knows when on the pages. On the covers, you see profanity and inappropriate pictures. The oldest book I found at school was worn out and from 2004. And most desks are broken at the metal bit and the sharp side is sticking out. If you bend over to get a pencil you dropped... ow!

I must admit after school children want to do whatever and roam around with friends I do so myself. but, when I come home and i think about it makes no sense to do so I am not roaming the school to learn it better I see my friends while school goes on we talk at lunch and recess. so there I go making a decision that makes no sense and then from there one I stopped roaming the schools and I started hanging out with my friend son the weekend not right after school.

30Q010,Person,queens,Middle,795,"Hey This is my first month being in Is 10 it is a pretty good school but it is not the best. I'm in the 6th grade and I feel like they push kids a little to hard especially if you are in enrichmond or honors having to have a 85, 90, 95, as your overall grade too much. My sister told me about her experience at school she said she used to be in the enrichmond class and got an 80 on a project she told me she got kicked out and after she started crying. I feel like the put too much pressure on kids some of the teachers are not really that nice in my class my teacher always says oh I can't believe this is my enrichmond class and it makes me feel bad. Bullying is a big thing especially in this school I have seen people being bullied and teachers not doing anything about it and it's not fair. At the same time I want to help the person but I don't want to be caught up in something that will effect my grades. I have also seen racism people make fun of others for being different. Also,  I DO NOT LIKE MY GYM TEACHER!  Everyday we play soccer no other sports she is very soft 
 She does not know how to yell and she has A very squeaky voice and the older kids disrespect her, and everytime we play soccer the other team wins and they be lying also when we score goals she says ""I did not see that"" or ""It did not count"" I do not know if she feels that to get them to be nice to her she has to make them win but to me that is not fair. The lunch is not really that good everyday is PB&J for me I do not like anything else. I have seen the comments of people saying it is the best school it's probably a lie or it's because their teachers do not care about them and they let them do whatever they want.  Uniform is alright  but they be annoying sometimes like it can be freezing cold and you put your jacket on your uniform and they yell at you or send you to detention like it's annoying. My mom made me go to this school because it was the only middle school that was close I asked her if I can go to a better school but she said no because she does not trust me traveling by myself. I like my math teacher Ms. Papas because she is very helpful and she actually helps you instead of shooting at your throat and expecting you to know everything,  
 Instead she explains things step by step. Science is good I'm going to the lab soon.  Anyways for parents or children please read this because I like this school but if you want your child to get the best education aim for something higher.",0,0,0,2017-10-30T23:59:09,0.75,0.16899999999999998,0.182,0.062,0.64,0.125,0.703,0.204,0.062,0.5660000000000001,0.161,0.17800000000000002
30Q010,Ms Tecza,queens,Middle,795,"As a former Teacher at IS 10, I can only share positive things, specifically:

Parents - Your child will receive a solid education from a fine institution which has a hardworking, dedicated, friendly and talented staff.  Your child will become part of a community of learners that are deeply cared for and loved.  They will be very, very safe and enjoy their middle school experience.  You will never regret sending your child to this school.  

Future Teachers - If you are lucky enough to get selected to join this amazing group of educators, you won't regret it.  I can honestly say that this staff is like family and I miss them dearly.  Due to child care/transportation issues, I needed to change schools, otherwise I would have never left.  I was there 4 years, and it was wonderful.  The tone and vibe are 100% upbeat and people are genuinely nice and willing to help you.   Teachers support other Teachers and every staff member is treated with respect.  

Administration - Principal Lopes is a class act!  He runs the school with a deep concern and passion for the children.  He respects you as a professional and allows you to have a personal life.  He does not micro-manage and empowers you to grow in your profession.  He values the staff and is 100% trustworthy and fair.  He listens to you and supports you.  You aren't going to get better than Mr. Lopes.  He's the kind of boss that you want to make happy and earn his respect.  

I was lucky enough to report into Assistant Principal Altan.  There aren't enough words to describe how appreciative I am for all that she did for me.  I was the School Librarian and any time I asked for supplies or needed anything for the library she always said yes.  100% of the time.  She's kind, fair and a great listener.  I was empowered to grow in my profession and given the flexibility to improve my craft and incorporate my vision for the library.  She's a person of her word and highly trustworthy.  

Bottomline, if your child attends this school or you're lucky enough to get a job, it will be a worthwhile experience that you won't ever regret.  A happy staff equates to a positive learning experience which enhances the student's lives.  This review is long overdue and I could go on, but I'd just be raving and I think you know I'm a huge fan.",0,0,0,2017-05-03T21:48:15,0.75,0.16899999999999998,0.182,0.062,0.64,0.125,0.703,0.204,0.062,0.5660000000000001,0.161,0.17800000000000002

I'm a senior at this school and my experience was great. Nice friends, lots of laughs….. but at the end of the day does it improve any education of mine? My grades are exceptional and the teachers are encouraging at times but they would see bullying happening and they would discard it. 
The uniforms aren't comfortable at first but you can get use to it.
Gym isn't that great. There are no proper working water fountains in either of the two gyms (and on some floors) and water bottles are banned. There are vending machines at lunch but they said we were not allowed to use them. They only possible time drink water is at lunch which varies depending on what academy you're in. (NYU- 4th, Columbia 5th, ST.Johns-7th)

They also do plays and performances and have beacon programs with sports involved. My brother goes to this school and next my other brother will go. Also has uniform which is great because it keeps the school in order, and you don't have to think in what your going to wear or be discriminated on what you wear, because everyone is the same. Also have After school programs that help you with your classes. This school has had a Grade of A for Three years in a row!!! I Highly recommend it. The neighborhood is perfect too, your next to train and bus transportation and stores (eg: Pizzeria, grocery store, super markets and etc) and the school has a backyard which is a park with basketball courts, handball courts, a big field and it was just rebuild.

The development has been right at or even ahead of my expectations. Granted, my kids both went to pre-school from the age of two and the intial shock factor of the a school environment was not apart of their introduction to this grand school. They have had wonderful teachers thus far, Mrs Bournias, Mrs Cohen and Mrs Manessis. You can feel the love from this teachers. As every parent would say, my kid is smart but I truly feel that there not only smarter now, they have more confidence and the foundation needed to succeed. Is it the best school in NYC?

We were scared because there was a talk of leaving my kid behind to repeat the grade... we had 1s and 2s only on major subject ELA and Math and my child ended having 3 and up on the State tests.

Ms. Pang and Ms. Griner are creative, professional, experienced and very adept at challenging gifted learners without placing undue pressure on them. I had two reservations about the school when I enrolled my daughter: the train and the fact that the Academy currently only extends til 5th grade. Both of these have been allayed—the train is not nearly as rumbling inside the school as outside it. As parents we spend a lot of time just outside the school on the steps where yes, it is loud—but inside the school it's just an ambient sound. I know that the DoE is making plans to expand and grow the program, so I'm actually very pleased that STEM will soon be accepting 6th graders. 


One of the greatest surprises about PS85 and STEM in particular is how smart and active the parent body are. They are organized, creative, and friendly, and our family has become friends with other families there in a way we never quite expected.

4-6 Tours and an Open House, where parents  have the opportunity to ask questions.

30Q122,newslink,queens,K-8,1330,"A current 8th grade student at P.S.122 writes, "" I feel that there are some drawbacks to attending The Academy, yet there are a few ups to being here.  The Academy is a lot of work; it's a lot of stress to come here.  I feel that this school focuses the most on tests and projects more than anything else.  The environment here is comfortable, yet stressing at times.  I recently had a test every day a few weeks ago.  That really caused a lot of anxiety on all of the students.  It is very hard to maintain good grades; for some people, it is harder than for others.  Teachers here are very strict on grading, and when it comes to weighing all of your grades during report card time, some teachers hold tests accountable for 75% of your grade, and homework, projects and other for 25%.  Other teachers are more lenient, but overall you have to be on top of your grades and never stop.  You never know when you're going to get a pop quiz in Spanish, or a complex bonus question in History.  It's just very difficult to be a good student.
Despite all of the above, I still will say that this school definitely prepares you for a higher education. I won't deny that attending P.S.122 will help you cope with more assignments and more deadlines to worry about when you go to high school or college, but don't be too quick to think that you can handle it.

He no longer has an opportunity to have a dance class because it was dropped due to ""funding."" He doesn't have access to an art class and only gets to go to the music room every other week. Instead of having the kids go outside for recess, most of the time he's indoors watching a movie. When he does get to go out, his class has nothing to do - they don't even get balls or jump ropes. They are expected to just play duck duck goose every time they go out.

They are expecting a lot from these kids, and some of them don't even turn 5 until December of their K year.  Why so much pressure on the little ones when those gains aren't making a difference in the older kids' scores?  

The movie instead of recess or some other activity should not be allowed.  She comes home and he is a zombie who just wants to veg out and watch TV.  When they do get out they are only allowed in the small courtyard area to play duck-duck-goose or hopscotch.  Why not let them run in the larger area?  I feel like I’m forcing my kid to go to prison.

Another thing that really bothers me is some of the letters and forms that come home have mistakes on them.  One form said it must be returned by Thursday...it was sent home on Thursday.  Some letters and forms don’t make sense and I’m not even sure how they want them filled out.  How can I trust these people to educate my kid when they can’t type a decent letter?

They deserve better examples than what they are getting. You know those tests that you read a story then answer questions well There is an Ela teacher giving tests without letting the class read the story from it first. My child failed the first one and she just did it again this week. This ELA teacher is railroading this class to fail and if i go and complain she will cover it up by lying and the school will accept the lie because it is in their best interest to do so. On top of this the teacher will give my child hell the rest of the year for my complaint. This is a bad experince for these kids and will make some dropout who other wise would not if they did not go threw this hell.

30Q126,chait2,queens,Middle,692,"I am guessing you are talking to me. No, I don't think you're stupid. I am a parent who has ""been there, done that"" in another junior high on the other side of Queens. Saw your post on the daily updates and thought I could give a suggestion. My son was badly bullied in 8th grade, emotionally and physically. He almost didn't graduate because he was failing most of his classes because of the stress. Teachers denied ""seeing"" the bullying.  He was coming home and locking himself in his room and not speaking to anyone. I  felt like I was being bullied too since I lost multiple days of work since I had to go to meetings with the dean about my son's multiple suspensions due to being involved in altercations. I also had to deal with my son's black moods. I didn't even want to answer my phone since I was being called by the school regularly about incidents. I talked to the teachers, the guidance counsellor, the deans. My son was suspended in school several times. Late on a Friday afternoon, I got a message that my son was getting a Principal's suspension. Of course, everyone was gone for the day when I called back. I was so angry about the situation at this point  that I had to do something! I looked up the discipline code, I found that the school hadn't followed the steps they were supposed to take in handling the situation. I sent a detailed email  explaining why my son should not get a principal's suspension to the guidance counselor, deans, assistant principal and principal. He had no history of aggression and he had tried to tell staff members about what was going on. The suspension was lifted. He and I wanted him switched out of his homeroom class because his bully had friends in the class who made my son's life difficult. Talked to the school about it and the AP counteroffered that she would separate them during homeroom period. A dean and I agreed that was ridiculous since the incidents happened all day long.  After a tag team of deans tried to railroad my son into saying he instigated problems with the bully, one of the deans was sympathetic and told me that I had to make a big deal out of it. I called the principal and the AP. The principal said he didn't think it was possible to switch classes mid way through the year due to enrollment. I called the AP and started talking ""district office"" to request a transfer and ""lawyer"" . A week later his class was switched. I made an enemy of the AP when her suggestion was disregarded. My son's class was switched midyear. He switched his homeroom, his teachers, lunch period and classmates. He was much happier and started to do better. Was it perfect? NO, the AP waited until the end of the year and did subtle but very obnoxious things to get back at me through him up until the very last day. Was it worth it? Yes. ",1,0,1,2013-02-14T18:15:00,0.5,0.081,0.17800000000000002,0.075,0.387,0.08800000000000001,0.725,0.285,0.171,0.445,0.08800000000000001,0.22399999999999998

30Q126,rob1167,queens,Middle,692,"I am a current parent from this school and i will not lie to you. keep your child away from this school. Teachers give work and tests on stuff they have not taught yet. Teachers and staff enjoy getting kids in trouble and watching them fail. My child lost a workbook and the teacher told me we COULD NOT buy another one (a lie) with no explanation why we couldn't you know like ""we dont have any more workbooks right now"" or something like that nothing no reason why. So my child spent almost two months writing the questions and answers for his homework from the website. Never less than 2 pages. Some nights my childs hand was hurting from all the writing. Finally the teacher must have realised the witch she was being to my child and let us purchase another workbook. Another time my child was givin a test from a teacher you know those test that you have to read a story first then answer questions. Well they were givin these question and answers as a test without reading the story first. I was told that another student informed the teacher that these test questions belong to a story they had not read yet and that they would fail the test because they had not read the story first. And the teacher did not care and still made them blindly answer these questions as a test without letting them read the story first. My child failed this test and maybe all the other kids in this class did too. That is an example of the kind of teachers and staff your child will be with in this school. I feared a complaint to the principle would have been turn around on us (it has been done to me before with this school) and would make my child be treated worst so i did not bother, but i would not suggest a dog go there to learn.

I have also been around for the past two principals so I know a lot about this school. I also don't think its fair to blame the teachers if students score low on city and/or state exams. As a parent of two teenagers and two school age children it is my responsibility to make sure that my son and daughter perform to the best of their ability. Instead of blaming teachers for students low test scores we need to figure out why they are failing. Yes, students are provided with test prep programs but is this enough.

30Q127,ARE YOU SERIOUS?,queens,K-8,1216,"I would like to say a few things to the staff at Inside Schools. Did principal Sanabria know in advance that you were coming? Could that be the reason why everything seemed ok. You were here for what a few minutes maybe an hour. I'm sorry but that's not enough time to see anything. Why don't you ladies and gentlemen show up unannounced. Then we can talk. 

As far as having a no -nonsense approach that's garbage. Since principal Sanabria arrived at this building student behavior has escalated not decrease. Some of the students do and say whatever they want without being reprimanded. Why... because the principal doesn't want a bad grade on her record and/or survey.  Sometimes one needs to realize that its not about themselves but about the children. It is my belief that all children need rules and those rules need to be reinforced. That is clearly not the case here at PS/IS 127 especially since Sanabria became principal. I believe the reason why some staff members have little to no confidence in principal Sananbria is her NASTY ATTITUDE toward parents, teachers and support staff. When you are new to a position it is wise not to refer to the staff as being FAT!! This woman is Nasty, Disrespectful and A Racist. Don't get me wrong it's alright to embrace your ethnicity but don't degrade another ethnicity just to uplift yours. Has she even taken the time to get to know her staff? No she hasn't. The staff at PS/IS 127 are good people but Sanabria doesn't know that because she hasn't taken the time to find out.

However, I will agree that she has improved the ESL program at the school but ESL just doesn't mean SPANISH SPEAKING STUDENTS and STAFF.  It's about recognizing all second language learners. What about the English language learners that speak Bengali, Urdu, Arabic or French? What happens to them?  Since Sanabria became principal has she hired teachers or support staff that speak those languages. NO SHE HASN'T!! The majority of newly hired teachers have been Latinos and a three or four African Americans, one or two Asians. Which I personally find disgusting!!

30Q127,Harassedprofessional,queens,K-8,1216,"Ruffled Feathers!  Seriously, the people at insideschools.org were correct to report that 85% of the staff find the administrators ""ineffective.""  However, in what sense of the word are they ineffective? I say to insideschools.org, the chancellor and the superintendent to look at them, and rate the administration based on the publicized data!   Speaking of data, if teachers are required to provide data driven instruction, well then so I believe the administrators should be rated by the data that the city collects from the survey.  Are they effective or ineffective?  Do they provide the support that the teachers, and support staff need?  The teaching profession is all about the children, but the constant bickering, and complaining will not change anything about the administrators.  They are actually very smart!  They play the game just the way they are supposed to for the Superintendent and the Chancellor, and yes even insideschools.org fell into their web!  

Not surprisingly, the school was very quiet when they came in to visit.  Not a problem.  However, what happens to the other 99% of times when there are no administrators around to handle the ever growing problem in the middle school!  The AP does his best, but not enough! (But I believe that he doesn't have the support that he really needs, if he did--he would have a better chance of making improvements on the student behavior issue.)  The new administrator seems professional enough and actually has manners, and treats people with respect.  

As for the rest of the administrators, they do what they have to do no matter what.  Yes they do have their downfalls, but they are also human beings, just like us and make mistakes. I am not taking sides here because the only side I am on is that of the student population.  Adults need to behave like adults--and Teachers should be allowed to Teach!  Great leaders set the tone of the environment.  They praise and reward their staff when things are going well.  A great leader will not make his opinion known, but will look at the facts---and act on it appropriately without the personal involvement.  

Unfortunately, there will always be problems in any environment where you have people that don't get along!  So all personal rantings, complaints, and whining is NOT going to solve the heart of the problem.  So with that it is up to the teachers, or anyone that works at PS 127 to make long hard decisions, and decide if they are going to continue in such a hostile environment or get out!  As for me, well my future is mine to decide, and no administrator, chancellor, superindent, or boss is going to tell me that I have to put up with so many obstacles at my job!

The thing is in Honors program you have to keep at least 80% of all major subject (Ela, Math, SS and Science), otherwise in mid October they will move children around in and out Honors (that happened in the 6th grade).
In mid October of our 7th grade they terminated a class and moved all students to different classes (this can be frustrating to an adjusting child).
Other than that I have had meetings with the office people, dean, pr. assistant and all were very helpful with information and advice to my concerns. I signed for emails and i was effectively informed each week of anything happening in the school. On top of that in 6th grade i demanded a DAILY report from all my child teachers of his perform in the class.. it was really helpful!!
The school is quite big and lots of kids go there, really a diverse culture. The school has several teachers each subject to keep up with student load. 
They separate 6, 7 and 8 graders coming in and out different entrances and having their own floors, lunch times, so practically they never meet. I heard during school hours the inside halls are extremely quiet, even when pupils move from one room to another they are aligned in column and in order, walk quietly and in general i never heard no one had any (safety) problem in that school. Lunch time - they have assigned seats, so the downfall is the children cant actively interact with each other, not until the end of the school day.

30Q141,l e m u r,queens,Middle,1180,"A really amazing school if you manage to get into the special privileged classes where you're allowed to take the regents(I think they added science regents too now?). Liked all of my teachers here in the 3 years I attended, many good ones that inspired me to learn. After this school i went to a [certain] specialized high school and didn't find it that hard to maintain a 95~ average there, of course, with effort applied. But I think if you manage to get into the top classes, (6H1, E1, S1, and their ""2 or 3"" counterparts) you'll be very well off. 

Downside is if you're not in the top classes, this is still a great school, just slightly less so. Also i don't really believe that the top class student selection is exactly fair. If you're in 6H1, almost definitely 3/4 of the class will go to exclusively E1 or S1 and the other 1/4 go to other ""1"" in the other academy the 3/4 didn't go to.Usually none fall out of the 1's. 

After this, other kids from lower honors grades [or if they're really good from regular classes] get placed into 7E1 or 7S1. Thing is, after 7th grade, the 8th grade class is generally the same, even if a (E/S)1 gets like a 83ish average. Few new people get in honor classes after 7th grade, since few get removed, the process is very lazy. To get the most out of this school, work hard in 5th grade and 6th grade(maybe) so you land in the top classes.

30Q150,A parent.,queens,Elementary,977,"	I am a substitute teacher who frequents different schools within the Queens area. I can differentiate between a good school and a mediocre school.  I can honestly say I am very happy to have chosen PS 150 instead of P.S 122 for my son's education, given that I had a choice between both. I don't exaggerate when I say, in my opinion PS. 150 is one of the top elementary schools in the city due to the wonderful principal, Ms. Parache, and her surrounding teachers with whom she works very closely with. Ms. Parache consistently looks after the welfare of our children and provides a safe and healthy environment for them.	 I will never  forget her wise advice when I came to her and told her that my son passed the Gifted and Talented test but the Board of Education could not find the application. She advised me to 'keep calling, be consistent and stay on top of it'; I did exactly that and now my son is a student in the Gifted and Talented program. 	P.S 150 also has some of the best teachers in Queens, NY. They challenge and work hard with the students to ensure that they receive the best education possible so that they are ready to attend prestigious middle and high schools after graduating. My daughter attended P.S 150 in the fifth grade and she now attends a private school on merit scholarship. She is a product of the education she retained at P.S 150 and her year there has helped her become the scholar she is today. I am very pleased with all P.S 150 has done for my children. It is truly a gem in New York City.

My child hardly ever spent time in the ""beautiful"" library as most of the times his class was scheduled the visit was cancelled.  What's the point of even having it then? My son had the same book for just about 2 months!  There are very few school assemblies or programs that are brought in, minimal trips, and few extra curriculars.  It's nice that they have a music teacher, but explain to me why my child didn't have music for 2 years in a row?  I think I heard that there may be an art teacher now, but who knows if they even see all of the students.  Oh and the gardens mentioned in an earlier post?  Take a look at the front of the building, what garden?!

The school itself used to have a low rating but has made great strides since Mr. Goldner took over as principal.  I think he's doing a wonderful job.

I am glad that she is in the dual language program because I have heard that some of the other classes have had a lot of fighting, etc.  I don't blame the kids as I have seen some VERY disrespectful parents there.  I was at a breakfast with the principal and one parent went into a fit because her child would have to go to summer school.  The mother admitted she never read any of the letters sent home and never got involved in anything to do with the school (so what do you excpect?).  This lady was from across the street and made a complete ass of herself including cursing in the hallway (loudly and after swearing how she was going to be a better parent and a part of the school) afterward.  Mr. Goldner asked her to stop and everything started all over again.

What impressed me was how many other women were there from other countries and had some trouble understanding the language....  BUT were a lot more involved in the school as a whole and respectful of everyone else.  Too bad the school doesn't have more of them and their children.

My kids had been living in a francaphone country in the prior year and I very much wanted to maintain french as a second language for them.  The private french schools were way out of my budget so this school was a prayer answered.  The year started off fine which I must confess I was very relieved to see because my son is very distractable and highly active.  To make matters worse he had no english exposure for a whole year so he is more than a bit rusty in his language arts skills.  Afterwards, I began to feel that my son's teacher and given up on him.  I eventually went in to discuss on 3 separate occasions my concerns about my son with the assitant principals and principal (each one separately).  I had no appointsments on 2 of the days that I was received and I felt quite welcomed.  In each meeting I felt like I was being listened to, I felt like I was understood and I left feeling that they were going to help me find solutions.  As far as my son's language arts needs Mr. Goldner and my son's teacher gave me very useful feedback at the Parent/Teacher's Conference.  I learned from them a keyword, fluency, which has helped me to find a helpful supplemental literarcy program.

30Q204,Jennifer Choi,queens,Middle,460,"This is a terrific school. Every time I walk in, it's like I'm walking into the best kept secret in Queens.  The class sizes are great! My child is in his first year (6th) and I have yet to meet a teacher new to the school so it looks like teacher retention is pretty good. My child is a participant of the ASD Nest program that is new to the school this year and everything seems to be going well.  The speech therapist of the program is a seasoned ASD Nest educator too!  Having transferred from a non-public school to having IS 204 to being my child's first public school, I have been nothing but impressed.  The faculty has been awesome about incorporating assistive technology as well. They are clearly open to concepts for Universal Deslgn for Learning.

My child is also a participant of the Magnet STEM program and science seems to be a big part of school. Not only do they have an enrichment teacher who is a certified gifted ed teacher, but the school has many science-based afterschool programs (1- Intrepid Museum A/S program in our school and 2- Citizen Science - kids study ecology with researchers for later publication).  These afterschool programs also host during-school field trips and so on top of the frequent field trips he goes with his class, my child ends up going on a lot of field trips! 

There are other programs at IS 204. I've heard great things about the Dual Language program and how well the students are doing there.  Additionally, there are two other major afterschool programs. (Beacon and City Year) Beacon, operated by the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council has a large variety of programs and City Year, staffed by AmeriCorps volunteers not only offer an afterschool program, they also support the school in the classroom and even on field trips! 

As a parent of a child with special needs, it's so great to have frequent conversations with administration, teachers, and even City Year afterschool program staff, both by email and phone.  The school also uses Pupilpath to communicate grades. Everyone is so responsive. I've been quite grateful.

30Q212,Anonymous,queens,Elementary,755,"The teachers work EXTREMELY hard in keeping the school afloat. However, I am concerned with the direction that the school is heading under the current administration. There are constant interruptions over the speaker, last minute notices that are sent out on the day of an event, and a lack of an ESL/bilingual program. ESL students cannot possibly be serviced by teachers who are IN THE PROCESS of getting their ESL certification. Disruption is also caused by constant changes in the schedule almost every other day. Favoritism runs rampant in the administration and those who speak out are black-listed. The lack of professionalism in the school is appalling.

30Q227,Adam Lorwell,queens,Middle,1585,"Wow... I can't believe that it was almost four years ago that I graduated from LAMS. From the pictures of the fitness room it is so hard to imagine that that use to be the girls locker room ( until kids were caught with drugs, then we weren't allowed to use them anymore for more then 4-5 minutes )  

Anyway, from the comments here it seems that the school really changed after I graduated. I was one of the OG members of green team and the annual musical they put on, they had some fun things going for it but the school was honestly was horrible aside from some decent teachers. I was also house 2, and from what I remember the hallways were a warzone and constantly over crowded. The B.O from the gym was I suppose to be expected from teens going though changes, also Helen was new so I never got to know her well. The floors never really mingled and mostly stayed with there group on each floor unless you took a bus, then interaction would occur. The academics depended on the teacher, most teachers give time to help the students but from my experience only early sometimes in the morning ( which isn't possible sometimes to attend if you take the Logan or Pioneer cheese bus ) 

Also they gave you a test in the 7th grade, depending on your score for the test you would be placed in either algebra 1 classes and advanced english or duel teaching classes for the less ""honed"" , this meant that not every student would be placed in smart classes. Honestly in hindsight I felt that that method was so ridiculous as to base intelligence on a single test. There are other ways people can show it though visual,  auditorial, or physical ways.

 I hope the school today has better teachers, cleaner bathrooms, less drugs, BETTER FOOD PLEASE ( LITERALLY I REMEMBER THE PACKAGED BURGERS AND IT HAD ICE ON THE PATTY ) , a different chorus teacher cause when I took his class he would favor one or two students and then the rest would be background noise,  and more activities for enrichment.

The principal, Ms. Ponella, is outstanding--visionary really.  The school's core belief is simple: every child is capable of excellence, and pre-sorting children into restrictive categories of achievement is a mistake.  And the school delivers.  Its state test scores currently match the best G&T schools in the borough.  By seventh grade, all students take accelerated math.  In 8th grade, 80% of all students take Regents classes, and of those, 100% pass the courses and the exams.  The school is particularly famous for its music and arts programs, yet it has equally great science and math programs (as the Regents results prove).  It has a competitive robotics and engineering team and a cool environmental science Green Team club.  The school looks for ways to involve students in its decisions, and to help them grow and mature.  There is an outstanding student organization that helps lead the school.  Students designed, engineered, and budgeted the new state-of-the-art outdoor play space.  Parent involvement is always welcomed.  Teachers are encouraged to keep growing professionally---many have advanced degrees.  Yet the students are always the focus.  We have been struck by how much of their free time teachers volunteer to the school--that's how much they care.  Every student has their own unique gifts, and students who are smart in one way learn from others who are smart in different ways.  It's an approach with dramatic results, which is why LAMS is called a ""model school"" and ranks in the Top 4% in New York State in terms of performance.  A large percentage of graduates go on to specialized and select high schools, and many come back to visit as alums, even many years later.

It's called houses, because all of us stay in the same house through 6, 7 , and 8th grade, with the same student , and student councelor, and by 7th grade all of us know eaxhother. As the grades progress, enstead of charging floors and classmates all of us just move further down the hall. I love this school because of the teachers. The tea hers actually inspire us to learn and do things that are not payed to do just to help us. Like buy extra things. Almost all my teacher have a background history of going to college graduating, and training in just to become a teacher. All of my teacher are passionate about their job. Also my friends helped me alot. I'm not going to say much about my friends because then this will be like an essay but I know that they have been the most loyal and trustworthy friends I ever had and ever will get. By the way I'm in 8th grade right now and have been I. This school since 5th grade. Also all 5th grade classrooms are at the first floor. Bye and hope u enjoy this school as much as I do.

30Q227,2727,queens,Middle,1585,"I don't even know where to start with this school. If I didn't have the freinds I did, I would not have possibly survived. I applied here to go to an ""Amazing school with great but strict teachers."" I was not happy after graduating eighth grade. In 6th grade I had a teacher that at some point made me cry every single day. And overall, everything else was fine. Then came seventh grade. I had a lot of teachers ( by the way I am a third floor student) It was a lot to handle and this is the only year in the school I did well in math. We learned nothing in ela, our social studies teacher didn't care about us at all and was just there for his pay check, and the science teacher was an amazing person but an ok teacher. really the only one that stood out was the math. 
Eighth grade I have to say, was the worst. Between students who cared more about social networking drama, dating, and teachers who didn't care about the actual students only about the state test, the year was bound for misery. people came up with a popular crew. If you weren't in it you were counted as unworthy or ugly. Some people thought it was a fashion show instead of school. students were more interested in smoking and drugs. Let me remind you that this is MIDDLE SCHOOL. Let me not forget about  a certain  ""performing arts"" teacher who insults students and teachers behind their backs and in their face. So much for having self esteem and confidence, those are to things that have become my weakness since those three years. I got bullied and called names by not only students, but teachers as well.

30Q230,Graduate,queens,Middle,1261,"This was an amazing school but to be honest if you're not in an honors class you won't get anywhere. You'll be mixed with the wrong people and you won't be pushed as much as honor students. If you're planning on going to this school try your hardest to be put in an honors class, because other than that you won't get any opportunities. The teachers are amazing and they're always there for you. They're cool and friendly, and although they get aggravated once in a while, they leave their judgement at home the next day. Ms. Terry is nice but she is like a barbie doll, sweet-talking and loving on the outside, but complete terror on the inside. She treats the teachers as dogs and only cares about grades than the students. The school is way too overcrowded but there is nothing to do about that, however, changing classes only takes about a minute so you don't face the crowd too often in a day. The classes are overcrowded but you'll probably be stuck with the same people for the next three years, they become your family and your best friends, so it doesn't become an issue. The homework isn't that bad, but sometimes it is. The teachers sometimes give all the homework on the same day so you'll have to manage a test, a essay, another essay, and a math packet. The uniform is terrible, but you can get around it because of the schools student government who gives students opportunities to not wear it, because everyone hates the uniform. The after-school clubs are an amazing addition to the school, there are many options to choose to from, it's neverending. However, science is a subject in this school that is way too undermined, there are science rooms but they are not used for what they are meant to be used for. The principal puts way more emphasis on the ELA state exams and Math state exams instead of focusing on other subjects. Chorus, band, guitar, and photography are the four talents offered in this school which is amazing. I am a bit biased because I was in choir for the three years in this school, so I'd like to say that it's the best talent and has the best teacher. You'll learn a lot and be challenged, but like I said, if you're not in honors, you're not going to be very specials. Try your best to earn the highest grades and don't slack off because that will not come in handy, because whatever habits and friends you make in this school will define you. Civics is the biggest thing in this school, it is incorporated in all our classes, although it is annoying and tiring, it's alright because even though they try to make it seem enforced it is not. The school doesn't have bullies, but don't get me wrong when I say the upperclassmen won't make fun of you but not to your face. The school has a nice vibey feel to it, it's pretty laid out once you get over the ""I'm new"" phase. I had the time of my life in this school but to be honest I wasn't upset when I left it, I was relieved, even though I did cry because I wouldn't see my friends again. 

Good luck in this school, it truly is amazing if you don't look at the downsides. Chose the right friends and make the right choices.",4,0,0,2013-08-26T12:29:44,0.5,0.14,0.129,0.034,0.335,0.077,0.6509999999999999,0.35100000000000003,0.003,0.584,0.047,0.124

Most of the teachers are very friendly and will try to help you any way they can. But, thats where the pros end and the cons begin: Unless your child is going into the gifted classes (6/7-03, 6/7-04), do not put your child in this school. The subjects they learn (math, english, sciences, etc.) are under par for normal classes; and the fact that some teachers are very incompetent in controlling a class doesn't help. Do NOT expect your child to get into specialized high school if he/she isn't in the honor class; as for my year, only a handful (less than 5) of students not in the honor class was able to get into one. Even IF your child is able to get into a specialized school, he/she will struggle to keep up with the huge leap in work, as I have experienced, so please think twice about this school.</p>",2,0,0,2010-07-25T07:39:13,0.5,0.14,0.129,0.034,0.335,0.077,0.6509999999999999,0.35100000000000003,0.003,0.584,0.047,0.124

30Q235,ciro dufrayer brasil,queens,Middle,117,"Hi there,

I was a student at IS 235 back in 1998 when the school was still located near Queensborough Bridge. This was probably the best time of my life. Although I must admit I was a wild child back then, I truly appreciate all the things the teachers at IS 235 ever did for me. I miss those days, and i still carry in my heart deep appreciation for all the work that they did and still do with newly arrived immigrants in NYC, especially in Queens.

For those who are currently enrolled at IS 235 my advice is that you take full advantage of the support that is provided to you by the great professionals who work there. I did not realize how important education is until later on in life. Today I am working on a Masters degree in Social Work at Hunter College, but I would not be here without the support I received at IS 235.

Best,

The teachers really do care about the students and I can just say that yes there is some favoritism in the school but not when it comes to the academic grades.

Tywls is a good school but its changing because of the fact that teachers are starting to favorite kids and the grading is also getting worse.
Tywls has been known as a great school because you can remake and prove to your teacher that you deserve a better grade and show them evidence but most teachers aren't giving us that chance anymore.
Of course I miss Laura a lot and wish she can come back because our classes aren't disciplined enough and she was less strict about our uniform and more friendly but Lisa is also a very good principal...
Overall I wouldn't suggest you to really enter in hs because they don't have AP classes and is a very small environment.

30Q286,Parent,queens,Middle,266,"Teachers here are great (really fantastic) and so are the ideals and ideas of school ...but many of the negative comments made here are true. The school takes a non-punitive approach, which basically ends up rewarding bullies and failures.
The same bullies and failures can barely write a coherent sentence in the English language, yet somehow mange to meet standards and pass every year. There is plenty of masking going on here, as if the schools funding is definitely tied to its performance. I assume that if one plotted the school performance on a graph, it may look similar to one of the Madoff Funds before the curtain was pulled back.
The staff is hog tied by an administration bent on having a polished image above all else, and they certainly have my sympathies for some of the behaviors that are being tolerated. 
The sad thing here is that a small group of bad apples is bringing down the reputation of a fine program geared towards Women's empowerment and leadership. The school administration in my opinion has not done a very good job of setting that example.
I think that if the school PTA, Faculty, and Administration discussed, voted on, and PURGED the 7-10 students that are true agitators (in the entire school not per grade) at the end of each school year, the school would be one of the finest on the Long Island, and certainly in the borough of Queens.
I believe that the TYWLS of Astoria Administration, School Stakeholders and Benefactors need to stand up for what is right over what is profitable for any one person. The school will continue to get the funding it needs, especially when attended ONLY by 98% of the girls currently there and looking forward to attending the school WHO REALLY NOT ONLY DESERVE, BUT WILL ALSO BENEFIT THEMSELVES AND THE WORLD WITH WHAT TYWLS IS CAPABLE OF GIVING THEM.

The other 2% can take advantage of some of the other fine NYC public schools in the area. 

Let's go school administration, start handing out some transfer slips with those final report cards...the future of the school will be brighter for it.

30Q286,Info,queens,Middle,266,My daughter was so excited to attend this school but after one good year all of our enthusiam was crushed. Their grading system is some made-up nonsense that doesn't translate into numbers or letter grades. Every report card is a riddle and we never know if our daughter learned anything. The bullying among the students is a major issue. The communication between the administration and the parents seems to be based on covering up any issue that may blemish their appearance. The parent coordinator Sandra Pagan is a pitbull who spews her devotion to the school and its families but acts as if she is the gatekeeper instead of the liason. She uses the word AMAZING so much I think she believes that if she says it enough it will be true. A few choice parents who have been with the school from its start are ferocious in their defense of the principal and are likely to be the only ones who think this school is amazing.,8,0,0,2010-11-16T07:45:58,0.75,0.038,0.158,0.008,0.177,0.06,0.541,0.293,0.079,0.42100000000000004,0.188,0.067

My daughter was also excited to attend this school but was disappointed with the ""push it under the rug ""attitude expressed at this school.Unfortunately, problems such as drinking in the school,bullying and rewarding the problem girls with little gifts to continue their good behavior have caused resentment in the groups of girls who behave well daily .In addition, the parent coordinator is a ""negative factor"" at the school and is engrossed with issues that she should not be involved with( such as PA meeting ,fund raising, how funding should be used ) She acts like she's the ""principal"" and controls every aspect at the school without any formal education. I'm not really not sure if the real principal,Laura,allows this behavior or it is just the patient coordinator thinks  she's in charge. On many occasions, she has given out ""inaccurate information "" to booster her reality which is not necessary the truth.So be prepared if your daughter comes to this school.

For the past 2 years I have been teaching my son math and Spanish bec the teachers just seem to keep dropping the ball.  They placed my son in an extra help math class AND an advanced Regents math class last year. (that just doesnt make sense) After realizing that he didn't need a remedial-like math class (after all he is in an advanced Regents Math class) they pulled him out and put him where he should have been all along-Spanish class.  Three months into the school year they put him in Spanish.  He was handed all the work packets from the 1st trimester and was told to let the teacher know when he learned it all so she could test him!  I helped him (the school did not) as best I could.  He still has problems with the basic foundation of the language. He still hasn't been able to bounce back from the lost 3 months.

We joined the school last year in 6th grade (the first year the school commenced).  We came from a charter school, yes a ""charter school"".  At first I was skeptical, since it was my son's choice to leave his old school and start a new chapter in his short life. So we (our family) took the leap. OMG..... I am soooo glad we took the chance!  My son left good friends behind but here his mind is challenged.  The school supersedes all of our expectations.  My son is playing trumpet (he took music for 6 years and never picked up an instrument until he came to HPCMS).  Ms. Liz, the music teacher works miracles with the kids. Mr. Piscetello, his science teacher, his advisor and mentor is an amazing teacher. He is also the 7th grade Dean. He understands this kids and has a good repore with them. I can't begin to talk about each teacher because they are all great teachers!  Last year Joe started with Mr. Rosenburg as his advisor and he truly believed Joe could overcome his fear of writing. Joe did and scored above his expectations in the ELA state test. Ms. Goodman has taken pride in hiring an impressive group of ""Educators"". The administration is highly helpful like the parent coordinator, John Rodriguez and their guidance counsellor, Ms. Grindea.  The school has a high level of academic expectations and teachers inspire their students to work harder. Ms. Goodman is the great leader with a ""down to earth"" welcoming approach everyone wants in command of their child's school. My son has been in their ""Award Winning"" Debate team, lead by Mr. Piscetello and Ms. Halloran since he started in the school last year. The Debate team won 1st Place the very first competition they attended!!! My son is not a writer, but this inspires him to be more than just a ""status quo"" student. I get sad thinking next year will be his last year in the school because he must graduate.

30Q300,G.P.,queens,K-8,524,"Our child is a 5th grader at a citywide G&T that falls in the category of BSI and District 30 (Q300).  Our child’s fourth grade report card was all 4s, state test scores were double 4s (ELA/Math) and perfect attendance. We put NEST+m first on the application list for middle school as it is geographically easier to get to for us, but our child is on the wait list behind more than 200 other applicants.  We are content staying at our current school as it goes to 8th grade, but what caught our eye is the selection criteria/ factors for selection to NEST+m middle school.  Specifically for students from BSI and District 30 (Q300) where the “Performance Indicators” is weighted at 20% whereas at other schools it is less or not a factor at all.  We asked our current elementary school and they had no idea what “Performance Indicators, as assessed by the elementary school” is, nor did they report anything other than: report card grades, attendance and state test scores for admissions.  

Does attending BSI or Q300 lower your chances to attend a screened middle or high school?

Does anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is?  And why are the Performance Indicators weighted the highest (20%) for BSI/ District 30 Q300?

Does anyone know the percentage of ""Performance Indicators"" for Anderson and TAG?  Is it 20% as well?

We realize that students from other districts/ schools may be less represented at NEST+m so can understand the need to give different weights and have different criteria to obtain diversity at NEST+m middle school.  At the same time, we feel that parents should be aware of the process/ criteria so they can make informed decisions.  We are simply looking for transparency.  Parents considering/ deciding on an elementary or middle school like BSI or Q300 (or other G&Ts) would probably like to know how their current decisions will affect their future options.

That said, are “Performance Indicators” used in the high school admissions process?   

Specifically: do screened high schools use the same criteria/Performance Indicators?  Ie. Millennium, Baruch, Lab School, Bard, Beacon and Nest+m high school.  Or was it purely based on merit for admissions announced in 2020?  

Picture quality is low as InsideSchools has a format/size constraints. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf28640d031b894277032bf88e80757547021e66683b247eca7791cd6bdcb513.jpg",0,0,0,2020-04-24T15:07:36,0.75,0.017,0.05,0.0,0.768,0.015,0.193,0.47100000000000003,0.046,0.10099999999999999,0.298,0.051
30Q300,GTxpert,queens,K-8,524,"@G.P.

The answer to your question is yes and no. If the chancellor and mayor has their way in the coming years admissions to specialized schools will be awarded to the top 7% of every middle school. So in top middle schools where usually a majority are offered a spot to one of the specialized schools, that will change to only the top handful. When and if this policy takes effect, it would push some parents to enroll in lower performing schools knowing that their child will be more likely in that top 7%.

You should look at current admissions criteria of screened HS you may be interested in the future. Some will stay the same, and some will change but you will at least get an idea. In the case of Baruch in previous years they took in the top applicants in its home district 2. Now it's a virtual lottery where any student in the home district with an 85 or higher average has an equal chance. Same goes for Lab High School.

Re: NEST, it is virtually impossible to get in at the middle school level as just about every 5th grader stays on for the middle grades. About half tend to leave after 8th grade because they got an offer to a specialized school.",0,0,1,2020-04-24T16:35:54,0.75,0.017,0.05,0.0,0.768,0.015,0.193,0.47100000000000003,0.046,0.10099999999999999,0.298,0.051

30Q300,Q300 Parent,queens,K-8,524,"I am a parent of a fourth-grade boy and he has been in Q300 since its inception, when he was a first grader.  From the beginning our experience was incredible.  We truly felt that this was a progressive environment that suited our son’s needs.  Gone were the days of red and green cards, replaced with mindfulness time and guaranteed recess.  His first-grade teacher Christina Baron remains the best teacher he’s ever had.  She truly understood the challenge of teaching a gifted and talented child and was able to motivate him in ways that we have not seen since.  He had a specific technology teacher as well as a Spanish teacher and he regaled us with stories of well-rounded and exiting days.

Unfortunately, although slow at first, the culture has changed at the school since the founding principal left.  There seems to have been an exodus of talented teachers and those who remain seem to be moved around to fill whatever DOE required void there is to fill.  He’s lost both his technology teacher and his Spanish teacher this year alone.  Also gone, the social worker, and original member of the school. 

We were so convinced of this school’s progressive mission at the beginning that we were willing to be guinea pigs for it, knowing that each year he would have a new (to the school) teacher.  At this point, I would not make that decision again. This doesn’t feel special anymore.
I hope that for the sake of parents who want progressive education and the kids who thrive on it, this school turns back to its original core values.

30Q300,George Washington Plunkitt,queens,K-8,524,"The following is an excerpt from the March 2015 PTA newsletter:



Kindergarten:

The kindergarteners have been solving simple addition and subtraction word problems in math. Students learn to recognize key words which indicate what operation is required to solve a given problems. They are encouraged to represent addition and subtraction with objects, sounds or sounds, and to visualize and draw pictures to help solve the problems. Finally they solved the problems by writing equations. Some examples of this type of assignment were on displayed on the wall outside the kindergarten classrooms during the parent-teacher conferences.

					It’s worth noting that while content of in-class math assignments may be a bit of a mystery to kindergarten parents so far, the children have been making fantastic progress in Math. Many of the earlier in-class assignments were activity based, which means the teachers aren’t able to send copies or results of the assignments home.
Examples recent of assignments will soon be on display for parents to see during a class visit to celebrate the children’s accomplishments in math. A date has not been set for this event yet, however Jackie and Eileen will soon let us know shortly.

					On April 17th in the afternoon Jackie and Eileen have scheduled a date for parents to visit the classrooms and celebrate the kindergarteners writing, and to see their past work on display. A note for parents, Matt and the teachers encourage parents who want to visit the kindergarten class to get in touch with them and schedule a time to visit.



The kindergarteners will be very busy with field trips as the weather gets warmer. On April 30th, the kindergarten classes will go to the Queens Zoo to participate in a workshop called “WhatAnimalsEat”.  On May 5th,the kindergarteners will be going to the National Museum of Math to learn about polygons and symmetry while participating in a workshop called “Shape Shifters”. And on May 18th, they will go to Queens College to see a performance of the show Curious George.


					Jackie and Eileen are working plans for a stepping up ceremony in June, to celebrate
the kindergarteners completing their first year of school and moving up to 1st grade. 
	


First Grade:



In Math students and their families concluded our unit on Surveys with
a Math Celebration on March 13th. Students created their own survey questions, collected data from classmates, and used the data to create graphs. We are cur-
rently working on our new measuring unit “Fish Lengths and Animal Jumps.” We will practice measuring with different units and practice comparing lengths.

In writing we are creating our own series books. Students are investigating what makes realistic fiction realistic, and learning to use patterns to help elaborate. We have also looked at realistic fiction writers including Cynthia Rylant who writes Henry and Mudge, Barbara Park who writes Junie B. Jones, David Adler who writes Cam Jansen, and Marjorie Sharmat who writes Nate the Great to help students
guide their writing.



In art we are exploring sculpture. We have learned about artists including Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi. Students have been creating their own sculptures using materials including paper, wire, bottle tops, plastic bottles, and wood. We will visit the Noguchi Museum later this month!

The Kiskeya Sports soccer program began on March 20th and will continue for 13 weeks. The students are also continuing their music unit through the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. First Grade Soccer and Music programs are both funded by the PTA.

Sixth Grade:



On March 16th the sixth graders had visitors to the school to take a walk through our Humanities classroom and view student work from our current unit, River Valley Civilizations. There were five “stops” (or stations) along the way. Students
acted as the “tour guides,” providing insight into the work on display, while others were stationed with some of our essential blended learning tools including Google Classroom, iLearn, MyOn, and ePortfolios.",0,0,0,2015-04-22T03:12:06,0.75,0.017,0.05,0.0,0.768,0.015,0.193,0.47100000000000003,0.046,0.10099999999999999,0.298,0.051

Sixth Grade: 

On January 24th, Q300’s Lego robotics team Atom Smashers have advanced to the New York City championship. The Atom Smashers, along with three other Q300 teams—Mini-figures, Senior Tech, and the XXL Fluffy Bunnies—had competed in the First Lego League Queens Invitational tournament. Principal Willard, Betty, the Vassar student intern, and many, many parents were there to cheer them all on! Con- gratulations to all the teams for their hard work! Special thanks to their coach, technology teacher Scott.

The students began a 15-week violin program run by the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. Each class has 15 students and occurs on Wednesdays and Fridays. Please submit your student’s rental form, if you have not done so yet.

The students recently visited the Ancient Egyptian art hall at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The trip was in connection with their humanities unit on river valley civilizations.

Beginning this week, in science, the class is studying ecology and ecosystems, including water systems and environmental conditions. The unit will be embedded into the engineering lab, as students design ways to contain and clean up a river oil spill. Students will also partici- pate in computer simulations of animal population growth.

In math, the students will begin a unit of Coverings and Surroundings which focuses on two and three dimension areas. They will also design a three dimension paper container that meets specific surface area and volume standards.

First Grade: 

In science, students are studying air properties and weather. In investigating air, students are determining whether objects such feathers, foam balls, cotton balls, and balloon can be moved by and through air. Further, they have used vials, paper, towels and basins to explore the idea that air takes up space. They also constructed their own parachutes to see how air slows the descent of a parachute and have learned what bubbles can tell us about air. In their investigation of weather, students have examined and studied different weather instruments, such as a thermometer and a rain gauge. They also have looked closely at different types of clouds and the weather they bring.

In a writing unit titled, “Review,” students have been learning to write opinions. First, they brought to school collections of items, including action figures, special pencils, unique stuffed animals, figures, jewelry, shells, rock collections and collectible cards. They then drafted their views on which collection was the best and why. Some of the ideas covered in the unit included:
1. Making sure that you stated your opinion;
2. Providing lots of reasons for your opinion;
3. Adding details to your opinion by saying why; 
4. Quoting experts and friends; and
5. Talking back to the reader

The students have now begun to write reviews of books, places, games, and movies that matter to them. After seeing the play, “A White House Adventure” at Queensborough Community College on February 13, the students will write a review of the play.

The students started a new math unit this week titled “Solving Story Problems.” In this unit, they will be solving story problems, com- posing numbers using multiple addends, creating equivalent expressions, developing strategies for counting large amount of objects, and recording their responses using standard notation (>,<,+,-,=). Students will play games that help build their understanding of relationships of numbers. These games include Counters in a Cup, Five in a Row, How Many Am I Hiding?, Roll and Record, and Dot Addition.

In Physical Education, the students continue to prepare for the Fitnessgram assessment, which is a widely used physical fitness and physical activity evaluation for children. They are practicing curl-ups, push-ups, and the pacer, which is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test. They also are continuing with t-ball and have begun yoga.

Kindergarten. 

On every Tuesday from early January through mid-February, K-1 parent James has been teaching music appreciation. His lessons are providing an important foundation for the students in preparation for Brooklyn Conservatory of Music’s music enrichment program, which will begin after the February school break. Thank you for volunteering your time James! The kindergarteners are also participating in another enrichment program, where they are practicing yoga every other Monday.

Parents may have noticed their child bringing home books from a higher reading level. The children use those books in reading class and should bring them back to school every day. In math, the class has been continuing to learn how to recognize, copy, extend and create patterns. In the science unit, children are learning about wood and paper.

In technology, the class continues to learn new basic programming, logic, problem solving, debugging, and creativity. Before holiday break, technology teacher Scott sent home a letter about an online course at code.org. The course is a supplement to what’s going on in school. It’s designed in a way where it’s fun for the children to practice writing code. 

During Friday’s “show and tell”, K-1 students can show one special thing and talk about it. Such item must be small enough to fit inside the student’s backpack, inexpensive, and not easy to break.",0,0,0,2015-02-13T04:29:14,0.75,0.017,0.05,0.0,0.768,0.015,0.193,0.47100000000000003,0.046,0.10099999999999999,0.298,0.051
30Q300,Guest,queens,K-8,524,"The following is an excerpt from the Q300 PTA November newsletter. 

Sixth Grade:  

This past month, the Grade 6 students have soared to “a whole new level of awesomeness” at Q300, a catchphrase coined and announced by Josh Reisner who was prominently featured on MasterChef Junior television show.

The students visited the 9/11 Memorial and the Museum of Natural History as part of their advisory and humanities curriculum.  The students took the subway downtown to the Freedom Tower and visited the 9/11 Memorial Museum, where they analyzed the 9/11 artifacts and learned a bit about the background of first responders.

Guided by Spanish teacher Mr. Edwin, students began writing on Un Poco Sobre Mi, or A Little Bit About Me, and have become proficient with Duo Lingo, a fun app/website that helps with language learners.  Parents have overheard their children singing alphabet songs in Spanish while showering.

Team Q300 has entered the four teams into the First Lego League competition coached by our technology guru Scott.

The Model UN team coached by our Humanities teacher Ms. Annette, are improving their speech writing and public speaking abilities, as well as learning
parliamentary procedures.  

If this was too much fun but not enough academics for you, then you are wrong.  The ‘Jen Ratio’ from the Mathalicious program was a hit; and even the parents have learned from the children why there is so much negative news in the media.  

In Science, our sixth graders have been busy building and testing Rube Goldberg
contraptions guided by Betty.  In Humanities, they are practicing annotation and analyzing high level texts.   

Using various Web 2.0 tools including Padlet, Haiku Deck, and Thinglink, our sixth graders have held online debates, developed collaborative presentations through
commenting on the positive (areas that glow) and negative (areas to grow) of
each other’s work. 

The sixth graders are excited by the start of engineering taught by Principal Matt. They started by learning consensus building and also working together on building the tallest structure in teams.""

First Grade: 

In the Geometry Unit, our first graders have been analyzing similarities and differences in various shapes.

After completing the “Small Moment” project in which students describe in detail a moment in their lives, the first graders have begun a nonfiction writing project.

In science, our first graders investigated whether toothpaste is a solid or liquid.

In a unit on watercolors, the  first graders took a trip to Astoria Park where they
painted in watercolors of the autumn colors.

In the daily morning meeting, our first graders have been sharing greetings and receiving the morning message.  They have focused on developing class rules to improve the class.  Class 101 has been focusing on saying greetings in different languages.  The first graders are beginning “Show and Tell” in which students will bring in something that is special to them or to their family.

Kindergarten: 

For the past few weeks, the kindergarteners have been learning about trees in science class.  They have complemented their study of trees by going on nature walks nearby the school to collect leaves.  They have also done leaf rubbings and used the leaves to create a leaf person!

In technology, students are working on programming animations. 

In Spanish, students are learning the numbers, colors and shapes.  Students have written “Un Poco Sobre Mi” (A Little Bit About Me).  Students have also learned the parts of the body in Spanish and learned to sing Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes in Spanish.

Kindergarteners have been bringing books home to read.   Our teachers have suggested that parents encourage kindergarteners to reading and write at home for twenty minutes daily.  

In class, the kindergartners have been writing stories about the their weekends.

In math, the kindergarteners have been working on counting objects, and comparing numbers and order by length and quantity (what, no algebra yet?!).",0,0,0,2014-12-18T05:10:05,0.75,0.017,0.05,0.0,0.768,0.015,0.193,0.47100000000000003,0.046,0.10099999999999999,0.298,0.051

Manhattan has four (Anderson, TAG; and NEST+M & Special Music, each of which also has a high school)!  Many families deep in Queens have been sending their kids on long private carrier bus rides to NEST+M.  This new Queens school will likely be a huge success, as it will attract western and central Queens G&T students who previously would have selected NEST+M, and used the private carrier for same, or would have stayed with their local zoned for schools, due to the length and/or cost of the commute; it will also atttract Manhattan students.  However, with Queens' large and continually growing population, and its excellent calibre of students, I would hope that this is just a start.  We could also use a Citywide G&T K-8 school in eastern or central Queens. In particular, Kew Gardens, Forest Hills, and Jackson Heights, all in Central Queens, have good transit connections via subway and bus.

Often, kids read other kids' homework and comment on it. That's all the feedback there is. Several teachers take weeks to grade and return tests. One sprang a bunch of grades on the students right before progress reports were distributed. There's not much nurture.

30Q580,718Parent,queens,Middle,122,"My 8th Grader loves BSGE and is staying for high school, as are many of her friends.  The homework load is comparable to that in other accelerated programs, like at NEST, Anderson and Hunter in middle school and all competitive high schools when you get to that level - which can be crushing at first, but then the kids sort how to get it done and it is doable.

It's true many kids leave for specialized high schools, but most of those kids came to BSGE planning to leave for high school and knowing that BSGE's rigorous curriculum would get them super well prepared for the SHSAT.    What's truly sad is that so many who come to BSGE as 7th Graders already planning to leave for high school and never really invest in the community.

The thing most special about BSGE to my 8th Grader is the level, and character, of in-class discourse (which is different from her previous honors program).  BSGE grows minds that think critically and analyze 360 degrees around an issue. The IB exams the kids take in 11th and 12th Grade are multi-part and, depending on subject, comprised of oral, written and project presentation.  Curriculum in grades 7-10 is designed, across subjects, to help the kids develop the skills they need to be able to do that.  BSGE's success in that is evident in it's 84% IB Diploma pass rate (highest in NYC!).  And, if you talk to the older kids, they are deep - not just academically capable, but thoughtful,  intellectually well rounded, and with perspective that reaches way beyond self.  

BSGE is a different education than the AP-centric or Early College schools - although it's Ivy College placement, and aid, are on par, or better than all (e.g., in each of last few years a student has been fully funded for all 4 years at Yale).

30Q580,potential parent,queens,Middle,122,"It is  different and great that KIDS learn a lot, high school is not the end of the education, getting into a great University is the goal. The kids do learn a lot and are taught to think independently, how does that translate to their transcript when applying for College. Where do the majority of the students get into, not one or two of the best students in the school. I had an opportunity to visit the school this year and I was not impressed with the wall reflecting where the seniors were admitted to compared to other comparable challenging high schools that I have visited. If the HS rating was the ultimate goal than the school has little flaws, but if the school is a stepping stone to a highly rated University, I am not certain that the school is doing their best for the students once they graduate, the brilliance and overall challenge of the program should not be a secret to the universities and the graduating students transcript do not compare on paper to other schools less challenging thus the handful of students who would have been admitted to an Ivy league school regardless of the HS they were enrolled in will get into the Ivy league school, how about the rest of the students? As a parent of a 8th grader do not lose the goal of the ultimate trip which is University placement and one should not judge the HS  by state exams but by the schools willingness to help the students after they are no longer students by insuring that their transcript fairly represents the individual students success in High School. The School has been one of my favorite schools to send my daughter and I am sure the curriculum will make her a better student and person but how will the school help her get into the next educational phase of her life? It cannot be a coincidence that so many 8th graders decide to move forward for HS, I suggest that the school actually did help them think about their future during their stay and the future unfortunately may look brighter some place else.

30Q580,718Parent,queens,Middle,122,"Well, first, you should look at this year's college placements.  Next, you should consider that some of what you see is based on financial circumstances of our diverse community -  the great majority of which can not afford private university and any price and/or are unwilling to send their children away to school (which in some part explains why you see so may NY State and CUNY admissions).  Also, with respect to Ivy's, BSGE's Ivy admit percent is on par with the most notorious NYC public schools - and BSGE's college admit has for years included truly great liberal arts and humanities based institutions like Wesleyan, Oberlin and Colby - schools where IB Diploma and the critical thinking it connotes is valued.   Next, I note BSGE has added Regents Chemistry and Regents Physics courses in 9th and 10th Grades, respectively - which speaks to leveling comparison to other competitive schools.  Some families are always just going to prefer Specialized High Schools and BSGE is never going to be the high school for kids from those families.

30Q580,Queens_Parent,queens,Middle,122,"See No. 7 first, and then read the rest.  You will feel better, guaranteed.

1) This school is limited to students who live in Queens.  2) If you qualify, because you live in Queens, you would want to look at the school's stated requirements in the 2017 DOE HS directory, including State English and Math scores, and attendance.  3) The 2017 DOE HS directory shows that this school only had five (5) seats last year for in-coming 10th graders. While the DOE HS directory does not show how many students actually did apply for 10th grade admission in 2016, those are likely slim odds.  4) The school is an IB program school, with students largely entering the school in 7th grade.  IB classes are much more rigorous than AP classes. If you did not take Regents classes in middle school and also have not already taken AP classes at your current high school, you would be behind the school's other students for 10th grade, which would make you an unlikely candidate to be accepted. 5) Mid-year transfers tend to be limited to so-called ""safety transfers,"" where a student needs to attend another school because of having been assaulted by another student or students at his/her current school.  It is doubtful that ""if a therapist writes a report"" that you would be able to attend this specific school. DOE does not let the student pick from all schools in the City for a safety transfer. 6) Please broaden your search of high schools with transfer seats, so you have more choices.  In particular, many large high schools in Queens have solid general ed programs, with opportunities to take AP classes.  If you are already zoned for one of those schools, such as Forest Hills HS or Bayside HS, you might have a good shot applying for a transfer seat.  

7)  Please register for College Now classes, which are college-level classes for high school students which are taught at CUNY (and at some high schools), and which will give you CUNY credit for college.  I think you will find that these classes provide the challenge you seek.  See link.  http://collegenow.cuny.edu/    Every student I know who has taken a College Now class has really liked it and ended up feeling much more secure and happy in his/her ability to succeed because of this, no matter the perceived quality (or lack thereof) of the student's high school.  You will also make smart new friends in these classes, from other high schools.  Good luck in choosing between many great classes!",0,0,1,2016-09-16T00:03:50,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23399999999999999,0.008,0.23800000000000002,0.525,0.0,0.09,0.32,0.0

31R009,Anon,staten_island,Elementary,291,"The school is great for many different reasons. First, it's a lottery 'unzoned' school on Staten Island. The ideology that your child wins ""the lottery"" by receiving a seat here is undisputed. The school offers many family fun nights that really help your child transition into the school. Plus, they offer enrichment programs like Soccer, Martial Arts and Cheerleading. Second, the teachers/staff are young, fresh, energetic and enthusiastic which children find easily relatable. Principal Deanna Marco seems to have a genuine concern for the school because she started the school. The academic results of Naples reflect her leadership capabilities, and that makes her a very involved principal. One major thing that I love is that because Naples is a fairly new school, the kids are growing as the school is growing. Currently, the highest grade is first grade, and next year it will be second grade. Any concerned parent that questions how bullying may be handled in this school, can have some comfort knowing that the kids aren't 'that much' bigger than your kid is (even in Pre-K). 

However, one major CON about this school is the early morning traffic problem. P.S. 48 (Wilcox) is DIRECTLY across the street and starts at the SAME EXACT TIME. So, we have the craziness that would be around any school in the morning X2. Additionally, there's a lovely (sarcasm) police officer that waits around the school to give parents $110 double parking tickets. If we were dropping our children off at a crack house, I can understand the distaste for parents double parking. But we are simply trying to get them into school on time after being in stand still traffic a couple of blocks down because of both schools starting at the same time. It would be WONDERFUL if Naples utilized the roundabout in the front for an all grade stop, drop and go program instead of what it's now being used for which is parking cars!?!

Lastly, despite the traffic/ticket/late issue that you may experience in the morning, this is a wonderful school with a great staff. What more do you want for your child than an outstanding environment where they can flourish?

Parents that double park interfere with the stop and drop system and put everyone at risk of an accident. I have no problem with the cops being there and giving out tickets. The school opens a 1/2 hour early for free breakfast and there's plenty of street parking at that time.

31R013,Jacqueline Smith,staten_island,Elementary,841,"PS 13 is a warm and nurturing place. The principal routinely tells students at public assemblies that the children are loved by the staff and parents. The arts are thriving, and I love that there is PE twice a week. All the staff and the afterschool people know the students' names. 

The school went to uniforms just as my daughter entered it, and I can't believe how much I love that! No fights in the morning about clothes! 
And you save so much money on clothes! 

My child has some learning and behavioral problems, so she is in the CTT class. Teachers and staff work with her as a team in a coordinated way and we have seen incredible results. She is doing so well I have to pinch myself sometimes. 

The homework requirements are manageable and age-appropriate, unlike at a previous school my child attended in Brooklyn, where teachers would throw15 worksheet pages at my child in kindergarten. The school is rigorous enough, but they rightly get the students to do most of work in school. The homework reinforces the work done in school, rather than asking students to learn new concepts at home, which is what appeared to be happening in the previous school my child attended. 

PS 13 could do a lot more to get parents involved and make the school a community hub. For example, my older daughter attended one of the top elementary schools in Brooklyn. Once a month, on a Friday morning, parents are invited into their children's classrooms for an hour as part of ""Parents as Learning Partners."" (Obviously, grandparents or other guardians can go instead of parents.)  Parents would then either make art with the children, or read and write comments on the children's stories, or read with the children, or play math games, depending on the theme or curricular objective that the teachers decided on. It was a great way for parents to see what was going on in the classrooms, meet other parents, learn about the curriculum, and feel invested in the school. The PTA also then had more access to the parents as they came in and out and could sell T-shirts, post announcements, etc. It was a real win-win. Sometimes they even served coffee in the lobby, and parents stood around for a few minutes and chatted before going off to work or wherever. 

Also, in all the schools both of my children have been in before this one, there was a class list every year. People could opt out if they did not want to be on this list. With the class list, people could easily make playdates, invite friends to birthday parties, and take up a collection for gifts for teachers at the end of the year. For reasons I simply cannot understand, this practice is prohibited in PS 13. For equally unfathomable reasons, there is no class parent. In the other schools I am familiar with, the volunteer class parent really helped the teachers by sending out reminders, recruiting volunteer chaperones for class trips, and connecting parents to PTA activities. 

We moved here nearly 2 years ago, and because of these restrictions, I barely know any parents at the school and my child, who is sociable and well-liked, has zero playdates. It is just impossible for me to arrange them because I work in Manhattan and have no way to meet the families of my daughter's friends. I can't get their contact information because the school won't allow class lists.

The strangest thing was during our first year when I tried to invite the entire class to my daughter's birthday party so that she could make friends in her new neighborhood. First, I tried to get a class list but was told that was not allowed, so I sent invitations to the class. The invitations were confiscated, and I was told that you are not allowed to give out invitations because children might be left out. I pointed out that I had invited the entire class, so no one would be left out. I was then told that for religious reasons, some children might not be allowed to attend birthday parties and might feel left out. I was able, with great difficulty, and leaving work early, to get invitations to a few kids after school. The party turned out ok, though some of her friends were not there because I couldn't find them to invite them. 

But that's not the strange part. The strange part is that later that month, the whole school celebrated Halloween - costumes and all, which is not allowed in many schools for - you got it - religious reasons. Some children are not allowed to celebrate Halloween and surely must feel left out when the whole school celebrates it!

Those little gripes aside, we love our school. They are doing great work there. My daughter is very happy there. As she gets older she will be able to participate more in making playdates by asking other children for phone numbers, and the obstacles to social interaction mentioned above will lessen.",0,0,0,2014-04-15T14:04:54,1.0,0.18100000000000002,0.249,0.064,0.753,0.07400000000000001,0.612,0.203,0.136,0.45299999999999996,0.175,0.24600000000000002

The same misbehaving students are given balloons to run up down in the playground. Student running out of the school building. My son’s cousin was threatened to have the police come and locked him up by the Assistant Principal. When I dropped off my son students are rolling on the floor screaming and running down the hallway. Kids who misbehave are given balloons and candy to run up and down the playground. My concern is that I don’t feel safe and having my sisters 7 year old black son threaten to have the police locked him up is pure racist. My son sees teachers pulling and grabbing black students. While other white students are treated differently. Our school is in a predominately Black and Hispanic in a poor neighborhood they don’t need to threatened that they are going to be locked up when they don’t behave especially from an authority figure.

Unfortunately for the school, its principal is elusive, menacing, and patronizing, and seems to enjoy her power a tad much.  The children never seem to be put first, even in dealing with security issues. Some teachers, apparently following the principal's lead, are extremely narrow-minded, very limited in their views about human diversity (while the school claims to be proud of its multiculturalism), and seem not to have the slightest idea of what the word ""nurturing"" means. From this experience I have learned that it is extremely important to meet the principal of a school before you choose to send your child there.They represent the philosophy and mission of the school and its attitude towards the role of children and parents within that mission. The success of a school can be measured in the amount of parent involvement or the lack thereof.""</p>",0,0,0,2009-05-13T16:36:22,1.0,0.153,0.239,0.047,0.87,0.038,0.494,0.14400000000000002,0.03,0.341,0.462,0.184

On a positive note- the teachers work very hard.  I appreciated the efforts of the teachers who always went above and beyond.  The Parent Math Mornings were extremely helpful and Ms. Pannunzio was always very helpful and worked to ensure that the parents understood that horrendous math program.  She provided parents with handouts and websites that offered additional support.  Ms. Vaccaro was also very helpful in understanding the purpose of the daily read aloud.  In my opinion it is because of teachers like them that this school is still functioning.

If you value recess, then P.S 50 is not for you. Your child might be the lucky one, if his/her class is given a pitiful 15 minutes of recess once a week. The administration claims this is due to being understaffed, and they do not have money in the budget to hire someone to watch your child. Your child will just have to deal with the pent up energy, and try not to let the restlessness affect their concentration in class. It seems the admin. is more concerned about their union contracts rather then what is best for you child. My child is in the 1st grade G&T class this year. There is a much greater emphasis on reading/writing in this school. Math & Science assignments are NOT challenging at all. During the G&T open house the kids showcased thier violin skills. Then violin lessons were cut from the budget. There is not much difference, between G&T and the regular curriculum If you do decide to send your child to this school, at least get involved with the PTA (seems to be the only avenue) inorder to fight for improvements, otherwise settle for an average education.

31R051,A.K.,staten_island,Middle,1335,"Mr. Mele looks for incentives to improve grades. School ok overall. Teachers mostly average . Admin brings in good programs. 

Some students were placed in honors from elementary then put in Arista, lowering the standards , some couldn’t handle harder work so acted out & were a distraction, loud & annoying in ppls face minding others business. All about social not compliance. Hope that’s changing. If it weren’t for that it was a good school.

Several years back a few kids had report cards that look good bc their past teachers/ school must’ve bolstered their work doing test corrections etc to get a better grade so they looked like honor students to be placed in honors but they weren’t in any way. 
Facts to that were proven in  this & next schools some could not handle math etc , common core, nor do well in higher level regents & AP classes nor handle the SAT, were below level aptitude their performances gave merit to the obvious that was true all along that some kids didn’t belong in honors nor Arista but packaged to appear but were not matched academically, in good character & immature behaviors. 

There comes a time kids need to achieve & perform on own. It’s a leap for such types to be able to pass career subject test like teacher or speech therapist, or lawyer or entrance college exams, etc so don’t put them in honors to begin with, it’s a false persona. 

Apparently there’s wasn't enough true honors kids to fill seats, maybe that’s changing.
Doing extra work & test corrections for a better grade doesn’t meet honors criteria.

Honors classes & Arista need to be better at getting the distractions out {would’ve been nice when we were there} who also struggle {math etc} to another class, &better for all.   

Some of these misplaced honors students looked good on paper bc of padded grades from elementary school & this one who hAd attitude problems when behaviors called out , had in for the good authentic focused honors kids, when called on it got aggressive defensive & blame noticeably bullyish reactions when called out for inappropriate behaviors { but reacted appropriately to their personality} so don’t put such types in honors to begin with. 
The school & true honor types  will get more out of authentic honors kids & will reduce the incidences of gossip& drama in top classes , inevitably such types are not serious about school & find friends who are like them is which was ineffective for them & everyones learning bc they are not a match for true honors kids & won’t click in honors & didn't  bc the kids didn’t belong in honors nor Arista to begin with. Parents explained kids out of trouble siding w kids {transparently inauthentic lacking merit defenses} then grouped up to complain about teachers & parents {carried over same aggressive  patterns from prior schools}.
So have more quality character criteria to begin with it’s better for everyone prevent problems & switch them out. Types described above now have limited future choices bc some kids  didn’t rise up being in honors they weren’t cut out for it sadly & were in over their head.

Kids need good prep IS 51 does offer good amount of prep , it’s needed for a foundation to get good jobs& into good schools. 

These kids are in our kids classes, buses, stores, community so it’s our business to live well positively, peacefully & not entitled.

 Education begins at home, holding kids accountable, not blaming teachers, nor other parents  or ppl for bad grades or bad attitude,  kids need to earn a good grades not get answers from others to pass a test or test corrections to have a good grade.

School still tries new programs . Still Offers help after school & test prep and tries new initiatives to bridge increased learning for better futures. If it wasn’t for the lower standard of some honor kids into drama who weren’t good academically neither,  the overall experience of school is good & theres a lot of good policies & positives about it and issues get dealt with.

Put less focus on how many friends a kid has {rather quality} or how many likes on social media posting date me pics like it’s a diary & kid has to ask for likes add filters  to make pic better,  doesn’t reflect reality nor make a happy successful kid nor does falsely putting in high academic classes, that’s setting them up to cheat & fail, it from within it’s just an appearance of keeping up &inauthentic....PS 54 was a great experience for us &happy w school it gets better & better ppl are involved  in last few years keeping PS 54 a v good school.",0,0,0,2019-01-20T12:14:21,1.0,0.068,0.272,0.09300000000000001,0.9359999999999999,0.025,0.434,0.348,0.067,0.205,0.355,0.152
31R054,A.K.,staten_island,Elementary,721,"I agree with your review.
School looks to improve grades & behavior. Tries new programs but education begins at home. Bright kids go here &school is diverse. Has a new gym too!

Parents need to hold their kids accountable and not expect handouts  bc they volunteer in the school as in having teacher do test corrections to boost kids grade then place kid in a top class to next school.

Some staff gave too much to volunteers & PTA in school including chances for some kids to improve grades, cool jobs, speaking at graduation. Also agree with reviews Some teachers gave kids handouts in past some PTA parents & others push for kids to be in honors, had agendas some of their kids struggled in some subjects & honors but teachers let them do stuff such as test corrections etc to get better grades yet kid couldn’t do math or hard subjects.

This make kids look better on paper then put into honors class in next school passing the problem as some these kids struggled with same issues , lack of focus didn’t do well w hard classes {blamed teachers for bad grades} but some looked good on paper bc teacher gave them Chances with other work to add points to grade to make an good grades weren't served well nor those around them . 

These kids were failing tests, need to cheat to pass, failed regents, AP classes& did v bad on SAT , evidence were not honors kids nor up to task. 
Plus some these kids were gassed up & kids made school about them& lacked good character, jealous of smart quiet kind kids who they competed & gossiped about & had it in for good smart honors kids, they won’t click with true honors kids.

Hopefully teachers these days don’t accommodate parent pressure as did years back bc as noted some still went on to distract, still annoying, act out, about being cool , all about social & what ppl all can do for them, what they like it was about them, were misplaced in honors lacking grades, character &lacking accountability {parents got together to explain their kids out of trouble}. So apparent this kids not up to task.

Some parents including some PTA aggressively tried to overturn some policies, some staff, rules, knew the system &covered for kids denying their kid was the problem some distracting class, some mocking others, doesn’t meet criteria for an serious minded honors students. 

Placing an average kid to a top class who likes to clown around turned out setting them up to fail, it’s unearned then these kids w attitude problems & hand outs find entitled friends alike them bringing down the class. Turned out not good for anyone around them & they come up short academically on aptitude tests later on, v poorly on SAT will limit good colleges & careers.

So how can students like these pass career state tests to be a teacher, therapist, lawyer, physical therapists get a v good job,  is it more entitlements? 
Have  kids earn their grades & conduct, pave their own way make their own connections to get a good job. Their college choices & majors will be v limited sadly. 
Education begins At home, have merit not sugar coat  when kids conduct called out parents  blamed others siding  with kid who didn’t learn to be accountable nor respectful.

Homes& schools need Positive Kids w good esteem not false persona need a structure,  it’s not about mostly hanging out with friends, vacationing, social media comments & likes, kids should be working, doing community service and not talking back & authentically being kind to everyone. 
It’s ppl business bc kids shop, go on buses& our are in our schools & communities so it’s all our business to be positive ppl in communities.

Other than this hand out w some families scenario ^^ was a very good school & makes improvements every year.",0,0,1,2019-08-23T22:18:19,1.0,0.068,0.272,0.09300000000000001,0.9359999999999999,0.025,0.434,0.348,0.067,0.205,0.355,0.152

(arts, animals, fitness, video games, books, history etc.) The homework is not a lot, and they try to limit the amount, in order to prevent stress for students. (they have a policy for no homework on Fridays.) Teachers are not bad, but some actually DO NOTHING. It's unfortunate, because students have to miss out on a subject or left to teach THEMSELVES. Yet, there are the best teachers that you could never find. Those teachers are like gems that make this school so UNIQUE. Of course, bullying is an issue at this school.

She looked me straight in the eye and said "" THEY ALL STINK""...but if you have to choose pick IS 72. My oldest daughter now a Wagner graduate attended I.S 72 without too much drama. My son attended shortly afterwards and there were constant fights in classrooms and bullying. Most of the teachers seem too overwhelmed to care. Mr. Freidman would tighten his belt and put some order in to his students. In six years I have seen the principal three times because he is always hidng in his office. This year is pure hell. My youngest is a student and we have had bus issues ( since they took the 7-8th graders off the cheese bus now the 6 graders run rampant). There are fights in the classrooms , hallways, school yard. Bullies do as they please. Kids disrespect teachers. No one gives a damn. Pupil path is a blessings but most of the teachers NEVER answer their emails so you have to call the school/ guidance counselor to track down their progress. Oh they still have that progress report but no one on one communication. My kid is a good quiet kid. She has gotten bullied at the candy machine ( they have made their own rule about who goes first ). She has gotten pushed numerous times. I gave 72 a nice quite kid and the school atmosphere has turned her into this stressed out child whose pleas go unheard. Now I believe they are also rezoning it?

The education that I was afforded was nothing but subpar, for the teachers were anything but experts in their fields. The school was inadquate in preparing me for the future, and I only hope that it has improved its academics as well as its bullying problems.

This school is the worst experience my son with special disabilities has had to deal with. They are very unorganized no sense of censorial environment for children with special needs. They do not get the gist of a complete disability vs. behavioral issues. They lack empathy beginning from their RUDE GHETTO SPOKEN ADMINISTRATION GROUP that represents an establishment of a PUBLIC SCHOOL in NYC, they are so unapproachable, they lack simple knowledge of information that DOE has on their website.  They are a just a poor representation of  what a school office members should be.  This school lack the teachers with experience that in turn equal to poor creative teaching lessons. As a concerned parent they simply do not meet any parental goals to looking to school for help for your child.  Getting children to be excited and want to go to school is a challenge all on it own, let alone having to bring them into this environment where they are not understood, manhandled and just brushed under the rug. in hopes to be forgotten. One thing is to lack DOE funding for these special education classes but another is totally different when the funds are given and they are not spent on the need of the individual child's disability ex. in providing or even outsourcing the adequate paraprofessionals they so desperately require. This is a real SHAME. They substitute pediatric psychological therapies with an inexperienced guidance counselor because they do not have one on staff, but they service special education, how is that even possible.  Instead of helping parents achieve the adequate funding from the DOE for these children, they just take and do as they deem fit. 

The children are not taken outside EVERYDAY for fear of they may get hurt, apparently they express that they do not have the man power to oversee and supervise them in the playground.

""From my and my child's experience in this school, I can truthfully say that some of the teachers are still a little green and do not have enough experience and training to teach the earlier grades. Some struggle with finding and incorporating teaching methods usually learned from years of experience. The young faculty in this school suffers from low tolerance, impatience and cookie-cutter thinking! Again, from my experience, I feel issues of low student performance in this school could be changed as I don't necessarily think it stems from the lack of parent involvement, but from teachers' hesitance to reach out to parents who are interested in their child's education. A blanket approach and grouping of good parents of this community with the negative parents are their downfall! As a parent, I feel a more proactive approach would be helpful when there is a case where a student has behavioral and/or academic issues.

We are 1st generation Americans in our family and we are proof of what a great school it is. We both attended and graduated from college I am now a Purchasing Manager at a thermoforming company and my brother is a VP for a financial firm. We are both eloquent speakers and can attribute much of our success to the diligent and caring teaching of our teachers at PS 123. Teachers like Mrs. Simon, Mrs. Sherman-Holzer, Mrs. Greenburg, Mrs. Glass, Mrs. Burgos, Mr. Halloran, Mrs. Gleason and of course our principal Mrs. Spatlor helped create the foundation that lead us out of the ""stereotypical"" life expected for children attending schools in the ""economic status"" criticized here. I encourage other schools to take tips from the way this school teaches and many more success stories will be the outcome. The teachers at this school taught me how to overcome diversity that no one can limit my accomplishments but myself. I am thankful because out in the real world there are plenty of challenges and they are not all just based on skill. Closed minded people still exist in the world and they are always looking for a way to make you second guess how successful you want to be in the case of the writer they chose economic status to be that limitation.",0,0,0,2013-08-07T19:20:47,1.0,0.363,0.171,0.054000000000000006,0.9470000000000001,0.14300000000000002,0.799,0.06,0.022000000000000002,0.889,0.02,0.179

32K274,Raulguadalupe17,brooklyn,Elementary,323,I went to that school when the principal was Mr. Martinez back in the early 70s and the school was beautiful. As children we learned simple values such as not entering without knocking or not taking a seat in an office unless asked to do so. The little things that today mean the world to me as a professional. I actually learned who was king tut in second grade and what it meant to respect my elders. God forbid we ran in those hallways or much less fought. my point is that it's not about how many people do the job but about who and how they do it. Learning at 274 was fun as a child. I am now 40 years old and i grew up in that neighborhood when it wasn't very clean nor safe but my teachers were my role models and most of us loved them even when we studied in the rundown annex. So keep up the good work and remember that what you do today as teachers may affect a child even 40 years from now.

Everyday there’s another fight with the students, regardless if it’s in the hallways, school yard or off the school block and they still make the students wear uniform otherwise they won’t be able to to leave the building during lunch and have to stay inside which is absolutely insane!

In the morning you HAVE to go through metal detectors, I’ve been stopped three (3) times in ONE (1) week last year just because of my keychain, during each of those times I was pulled to the side and had to get a body search and they even searched my bag which was embarrassing yet other students with keychains never had to go through this. Plus, you can’t even have your phone with you in this school, they put it in pouches that have a lock like in the store on clothes!!

Currently, we stand as one of the most improved schools in New York City that is on a fast track to the top. Roland Hayes Intermediate School 291 boasts a superior staff of qualified teachers whose expertise in content areas and capacity to care far exceed the requirement of the New York City Department of Education.  As a relatively new teacher at this school I too came in with a rather stereotypical view only to be pleasantly surprised and today I find myself proud to be a part of this institution. Under enthusiastic leadership, this school has been a resounding success with clean, beautiful, picturesque classrooms that are print-rich and have a wide variety of materials designed to facilitate enjoyable and effective teaching/learning experiences.  I.S. 291 is now a well-oiled machine with systems in place and support staff that will allow us to walk confidently in the present and boldly claim the future. The school has been the site for city-wide professional development sessions and activities like the marking of the state examinations. Visitors have constantly made comments about the clean environment and the atmosphere of industry that is present within the walls of the school.   I have had the distinct honor of impacting the lives of many students and this experience has been mostly positive. Over the past two years, I have grown with my students to the extent that I know that I have gotten as much out of this partnership as they have. I have been a facilitator in classrooms where students have demonstrated a maturity far beyond their years. They have shown a desire to learn and grow emotionally, socially and academically. As I put these thoughts on paper, I cannot help but think that some doubting Thomas will consider this to be just rhetoric. In order to dispel this notion, I will allow anyone with the proper authorization to visit my class, even without giving me notice.

You have to battle your way through 5th grade nonsense teachers and petty disengaged students in order to get into honor classes which holds teachers that are fun and actually teach you stuff and students that are engaged and helpful, but also very entertaining and funny. That is the goldilock zone of Schuyler. Only a few select teachers and a fraction of the students are like that. This school builds you up to the high school experience and so far the rigorous academics are being used quite frequently, which is a good thing; preparing you for the future. But then again, that only comes with the goldilock zone of students and teachers. Even though not so pretty on the outside, when you develop deep into the school community and reflect on what has happened over the years, Schuyler was actually a very good school. Though not being good as it used, downgrading from Brooklyn Tech having most seats taken up by Schuyler to just eight people getting into Tech now, it is still a great school and I hope that most of the 8th grade teachers, who are the best at giving rigorous yet engaging instruction with them having the most years at the school, still teach to this day and in the future. In short, great school concept, amazing staff, 5th 6th grade teachers needs work, 7th 8th grade teacher absolutely amazing, school environment is ok, students terrible, and only a fraction, (like those eight people that got into Brooklyn Tech + a few more academia focused) students are amazing.

The majority of the teachers have been outstanding. A few teachers gave unmerited low grades at times and you would only find that out when you saw the report card. Those teachers had to be reminded that parents are collaborators in the education of their children and needed to be informed of issues before Parent Teacher Conference.  The school's website still remains horrible despite several suggestions to update it. If I was tech savvy i would do it. They could put up better room signs at the end of the hallways because it's a maze in there.  My biggest problem is that my daughter has never met with her guidance counselor!

32K383,Aneicia W,brooklyn,Middle,909,"Insideschools, it is time to visit this school again.. a lot has changed including the leadership, as Ms. Saunders is no longer the principal. Ms. Smith now leads the school and although she presents as thoughtful and fully supportive of her students and staff, there is always pressure to fill the shoes of a beloved school leader. 

I am familiar with the school now because this is my daughter's first year there and she loves it! I'll say my biggest concern was the change in student body that could make or break a student's confidence. But my informal assessment of the students are that they are prideful ""smartypants"", hip BK or Queens natives who come from supportive and stable homes. The last open school night was RIDICULOUS there were so many parents there... I was complaining and loving it at the same time. The kids ride in groups on the buses, trains and vans and although there is some loud, obnoxious typical young teen brash talk, the kids are really harmless. 
The stats and recent grade for 383 are disappointing, but it is only with the resolve of the school, parents and most certainly the kids -- that 383 can rise back to the top. I hope that the class my daughter is in will be part of the resurgence of 383, the school deserves the recognition... the kids are great and impressive!! ",17,0,0,2012-12-24T16:38:50,0.5,0.057999999999999996,0.16699999999999998,0.07,0.907,0.10300000000000001,0.644,0.046,0.345,0.5710000000000001,0.023,0.166

32K383,Mom of 3 children,brooklyn,Middle,909,"Both my daughter and son were accepted to 383 last year and two years ago. I had them take the test to ""see"" how they would do. Ten ago, 383 had a good reputation because the former principal ran that school as a no-nonsense lady. Today, it is different. Don't be fooled by the posts on this site (good, bad or even my own)! Some of the posts are genuine (good and not so good); but some posts are clearly created by others pretending to be students when they may be school staff trying to give a better impression than what it really is. The fact is that the school accepts students based largely on test scores- period. If you really want to get a flavor of how the school really is, JUST OBSERVE THE STUDENTS AND SAFF AFTER DISMISSAL ON A MILD DAY EITHER ON WILSON AVENUE OR IN FRONT OF BURGER KING ON MYRTLE AVENUE (both around the corner from the school's main entrance). What you will see are many ""gifted and talented students"" (not all all but MANY students) acting contrary to how a scholar is supposed to act. 383's reputation is propped up by the exam- the students will succeed even without the teachers as in many good schools. In the end, I used my sister's address based solely on what I saw during dismissal for three days- in early October, end of April and mid-May in two different years. (in two years my little one will take the test- maybe things will change- we'll see). If you are a concerned parent, base part of your decision on what your child may experience EVERYDAY as soon as the students are dismissed. I have no doubt that there are many good staff members and students in 383, but in my opinion test scores alone do not make the daily experience of what children go through during their middle school years.

32K383,Roberto,brooklyn,Middle,909,"Man what's with the spamming on this site... I wish the moderators could take a look and remove the last few comments... It really detracts from the older reliable comments about this school...

My experience... My little brother is a 6th grader in this school, it's his first year. He loves it. In his old school, he excelled and at times was a little lazy because the work wasn't all that difficult even in the honors classes. That being said, now that he was moved into the honors classes at this school I can honestly say that this school does a great job of teaching their students and giving them challenging work. My brother can attest to that, though begrudgingly... He's very smart but lazy... lol 

One of the other things that really caught my attention was how nice most of these students are compared to other schools. For example, my little brother was zoned to go to 93 but as a temporary substitute last year I couldn't believe the problems that took place at that school. Little 11 year old kids waving puerto rican and dominican flags in the building screaming Latin King or Trinitario... It was ridiculous... This school has none of that. Sure, there are some knuckleheads here and there, but the difference in this school is that they are the overwhelming minority as opposed to other zoned schools around the area which are the exact opposite...

Rauli has taken the step up as the principal of the school and is doing a wonderful job. People are glad with the educational decisions that the staff make. They also teach the students that role-modeling is the key to success in the world. They currently have one of their former students and technology squad still helping out to the best of his ability. let us take a moment to honor Ms Brunhilda Ortiz for her outstanding achievement in education and for being the best principal ever known to the city. I hope this school continues to grow stronger and ultimately become the elite school of NY.
