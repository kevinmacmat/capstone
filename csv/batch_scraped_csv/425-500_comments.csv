We have an amazing group of parents who have organized regular events for the children and I am often surprised to see the amazing things they are doing.  Yearly march to Boro Hall, with study of the civil right movements incorporated.  Arts week, with teaching artists brought in.  We have a beautiful garden and gardeners brought in to teach the children.  The after-school puts on an incredible musical as well as offering a wide variety of classes that my son loves.  Special shout-out to Ms. Khadiga, the science teacher, who has been a real mentor to my kid.  
Every time I'm in the school (not as often as when he was younger), I'm always impressed with the energy and smiles from everyone - teachers, kids, administration, school security, after-school counselors.

I think the school deserves at least some of the credit for the friendly, accepting students, since they emphasize social- emotional development along with academics.

Often I feel like kids are pushed ""academically"" too quickly at the cost of developing other more age appropriate skills like curiosity, playing, exploring and fully understanding themselves as social creatures. A lot of research has recently been done shedding light on the fact that pushing kids too early in academics can be damaging in that it can lead to resentment and frustration with school--so its better to let the kids develop these skills through exploration in their own time I think. This is what I see happening at 261 as least at the K level, I mean they are only babies still in many ways. Having said that there are some kids in his class writing full sentences etc and I think they are equally challenged and supported as the kids still growing these skills.

15K261,positive parent,brooklyn,Elementary,758,"261 is working hard to make up for the absence of science in grades K, 1, and 5.  The absence of science in these grades currently is simply due to the fact that we are short one teacher and have not yet been able to replace this individual because it can only be filled as a part-time spot.  Our brilliant, hard-working, full-time science teacher is working closely with the teachers in these grades and incorporating the school's brand new garden as well as utilizing the fully-stocked science room to have science taught.  I am confident that it will be successful. The additional gym teacher is also teaching health containing some science, which is part of the curriculum.  The new librarian is being paid for entirely out of the PTA's budget through a grant, not the school's.  The absence of art for some classes is only due to the fact that one teacher is on maternity leave.  While it is great when every class has art, all teachers routinely incorporate various art projects as part of the curriculum (as well as 261 having a tremendous Arts Day in the winter and a fantastic after-school program with many art options).",3,0,0,2013-10-17T18:21:42,1.0,0.045,0.198,0.012,0.889,0.051,0.285,0.077,0.203,0.195,0.47100000000000003,0.147
15K261,concerned parents,brooklyn,Elementary,758,"This year some grades (Kindergarten, First Grade, and Fifth Grade) are not getting Science or Art instruction at PS261, yet the school hired one extra Gym teacher and a new librarian. Although I am a big fan of our school, I became very concerned with this big lapse of judgment by administration. The school's administrators claimed that children will be studying ""Environmental Science"" by visiting a brand new garden in the school's yard. If I had a choice, I would prefer our children have a proper Science lesson/curriculum rather than having a fancy playground to brag about. A rare recent ""Science lesson"" for fifth graders was a combined session with kindergarteners; they made a ""poster"" showing how to behave in the new garden and how not to litter. Granted, it is important to teach children not to litter, but that is not really Science. That is an Art activity. The administration has said that homeroom teachers are going to teach Science but the teachers are not prepared to teach Science (since they have never done this) and the 5th grade curriculum was already set for the year and they don't have room to fit in extra Science lessons (without eliminating other coursework). I am concerned about the impact of this decision on both children, parents and next year enrollment. While American children are behind other nations in Science, I was hoping that our educators understand the importance of fostering a good foundation in Science.

I used to bring my daughter early so she could chat with friends before school started, but after seeing this chaotic start to the morning, I opted to bring her at 8:45am giving no room for any unsupervised mishaps.  There are WAY too many parents in the cafeteria standing around drinking coffee & chatting with their friends which while it should be an open welcoming community -contributes to the loud overcrowded state - especially when the parents don't do anything to help create a more relaxed environment.   I did hear mention a while back during a PTA meeting about parents volunteering in the morning but like everything else, nothing ever came of this.  How staff and parents can think this is okay is beyone me.  I do understand that budget cuts have limited the number of staff available however the cafeteria in the morning is sad sight to see - I got a headache one time from being there so I can imagine how my daughter used to feel.   **Maybe this is why so many parents are there because they wouldn't DARE leave their child in the cafeteria without better organization or proper supervision.

I can only imagine how crazy it is for teachers who then have to enter this crazy chaos to try & line their classes up while everyone then tries to exit through one set of doors - ALL while parents with concerns are trying to have their needs addressed amid this chaos.  Then get the classes upstairs to spend 10-20 minutes calming the class down from the cafeteria chaos.
  
My only suggestion to your concern would be to send an email to the teachers if there is a ""pressing issue"" - it unfortunately seems a little impersonal, but you have to try to balance how many other parents are vying for 2-3 minutes of convo time with the teachers immediate need to manage 20-25 riled up kids & get them safely to their classroom.  Emailing my daughter's teachers has always worked for me & they typically respond as soon as they can.  Hopefully things have since changed with your child's teachers - unfortunately nothing has changed in the cafeteria.",5,0,0,2013-02-06T07:38:07,1.0,0.045,0.198,0.012,0.889,0.051,0.285,0.077,0.203,0.195,0.47100000000000003,0.147

15K261,Parent,brooklyn,Elementary,758,"In the past year or two, I've noticed the school take on a decidedly political tone. While staff and teachers are certainly entitled to their beliefs--and to advocate for those beliefs in their personal time--it is wholly inappropriate for those opinions to spill into the classroom. The school is relatively large and very diverse, and it's stupid, naive and arrogant to assume that the entire community will agree with the opinions of a vocal few. What was once a warm and welcoming community is anything but that now.

Example: At least two teachers (that I know of) have spent class time disparaging charter schools to their students. One even had her students make anti-charter school posters during class. The personal political beliefs of teachers have no place in the classroom, and the lack of professionalism is shocking to me.

Several children in the school have siblings who attend charter schools, and it's cruel and insensitive to put a young child in a position where he/she must listen to a teacher criticize a personal family decision. Children, of course, want to be liked by their teachers, and few have the strength of will to listen to criticisms like that and not take them personally.

15K261,Parentyparent,brooklyn,Elementary,758,"Of all the schools my children have attended over the years (4 including this one) PS 261 has the most unwelcoming policies towards parents by a landslide!  Lip-service is paid to 'parent involvement', but the school has done everything in it's power to keep parents at arm's length, and there's a distinct (and worrisome) lack of transparency.  One can't help but wonder if all of the barriers are in place to keep parents from seeing what's really going on.

Administration seems far more concerned with controlling the parent's behavior than the children's.  For instance, if you arrive after 8:30 you cannot escort your child into the the gym where the teachers pick them up, regardless of the circumstance... even if your child is crying.  You must also get passes and permission to access your child's teacher before or after school unless you make an appointment beforehand.  They deem it a ""safety issue"", but any proactive parent knows that some things cannot be foreseen, and need to be addressed on the spot.  Meanwhile, the kids run like wild animals in the cafeteria during breakfast (and I can only assume lunch) through spilled beverages and dropped breakfasts.  It is not unusual to see kids run and slip through various spilled liquids on the floor while the staff looks on without invervening (or cleaning up).  That, however, is not considered a ""safety issue"".

Of course, the teachers and administrators don't mind reaching out to the parents when they need or want something from them.  They welcome parents' money and support, but not the parents themselves.  As a former parent council member for two consecutive years at a previous school I would gladly fundraise for, and otherwise help out the school (which is in desperate need of funds), if only I felt like a welcome member of the school community instead of an annoyance with a wallet.",5,0,0,2011-11-22T18:29:30,1.0,0.045,0.198,0.012,0.889,0.051,0.285,0.077,0.203,0.195,0.47100000000000003,0.147

15K295,ParkSlopeMomz,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"Our child had many wonderful years at PS 295, and has fond memories of those years. Unfortunately, with the exception of the last year in 5th grade. The 5th grade experience, in our opinion, did not foster or implement the ideals of the community we grew to love for many years. We found that the problem was a combination of large class sizes, and the style of teaching. The teachers seemed unwilling to accept challenges of having close to 35 students and completely gave up on the students mid year. They did not implement effective management techniques and were unwilling to work with parents through their concerns. They were defensive in nature and lacked confidence to find a solution. Each day students came home frazzled from all the chaos. However, the administration were actively working with parents to address their concerns but after a while there was nothing to be said and done due to the teachers unwillingness to work in effective management techniques. Having been a member of this community for years and having gotten to know the children in the grade, it was unacceptable to place the blame onto children who have flourished and thrived in other classroom environments with different styles of leadership. We made the mistake of speaking with other parents about our concerns way too late in the year, when there was little time left to take action, but we learned that so many families dealt with the same frustrations. I write this for future 5th grade families who also face these challenges. Join together and speak up the minute your child comes home and tells you stories that make you go “hmmm..” Join together with your concerns because with everyone individually voicing their experiences, then it is much easier for the concerns to get swept under the carpet. 
Some of our specific concerns were: teachers telling children “they werent ready for middle school” which triggered anxiety, teachers telling children they were not going to succeed at life, eliminating all parties and forms of entertainment creating an imbalance in the community, inconsistencies in homework and classwork (going weeks without anything to piling it on where children spent their entire night binge working), having a bottle on their desk with the phrase “tears of our students”, lack of creative instruction and a dry curriculum, not focusing on writing grammar, spelling and syntax, failing to differentiate instruction and understand individual needs and how to create a community. The teachers took a dictatorship approach which we found riled the children up rather than diffusing their behaviors. 
We met with the teachers many times, and then the administration many times and were told just to get through the year. It was a very sad way to end our time in a place that we loved so much.",0,0,0,2019-07-09T02:09:40,1.0,0.098,0.33799999999999997,0.005,0.687,0.071,0.391,0.096,0.076,0.40399999999999997,0.369,0.128

It's a small, tightly-knit community; we feel like we know almost everyone there and have formed deep friendships (both for the kids and parents!). Principal Mazza & VP Pagano are very approachable and warm and really know the kids. The teachers are easy to reach with in-person weekly meetings, or email. All of the staff engage with all the kids, whether they have them in class or not. We have a wonderful Parent Coordinator, Mr. Borrero, who is always helpful in sorting out any questions or concerns that come up - and the kids LOVE playing soccer with him!

Some of the things we love about 295 are: the diversity of the community, the emphasis on the arts, the focus on each child by their teachers, the idea of keeping school fun & approachable, the high level of commitment from everyone, and the ease of getting involved as a parent - however you're able. We find the academics to be challenging without being overwhelming; each child is engaged at their specific level. The support for special needs learners is great: the paraprofessionals, therapists and guidance counselor work as a team to help the kids, both academically and emotionally. 

The PTA is highly active and does amazing things for the school, with the parents working closely together with the staff. There are tons of events where you meet new people & kids make friends (Touch-a-Truck, monthly cupcake sales, Family Fun Fridays, Boogie Brunch, Spring Arts, Dance shares, etc.) There is an online group which is very supportive; information shared and advice to those who seek it. Parents are invited into the classrooms regularly: Parent-Teacher conferences two times a year, Bagel Bits every month (breakfast at the school & then they invite us into the classroom for a period to watch), monthly PTA meetings, countless committees to help out, weekly school bulletins, etc. And parents can arrange to come into the class to read a book or talk about a holiday, job or something else the kids are interested in. 

Congregation Beth Elohim runs the afterschool program and their teachers and on-site staff at 295 are very fun & friendly.

Our boys love their school and we love PS 295! And most importantly the school really reflects and celebrates the diverse community it serves. We love it here.

15K295,295 Mama,brooklyn,Elementary,396,I'm a new 295 Mama who fell in love with the school on a tour when I found myself weeping at how much what I was hearing from the principal - was exactly what I wanted to be hearing from my kids school. It is exceptional as compared with my zoned school which is suffering from chronic abstenteeism and an unsupportive Principal. I cant say enough about 295! The afterschool options are the best (partnered with Cong. Beth Elohim) and the teachers are happy and supported and you know it because they stay year after year. The specials are amazing. I just watched the 4th and 5th graders production of Little Red Robin Hood and was blown away! The Seeds of Kindness Program sends my first grader home teaching me about mindfulness (!) and the diversity is real - not tokenist. I love this community and if you're zoned for a school you're not into - come check out PS 295. There is often space for Kinders and 1st graders from out of zone.

15K295,PS 295 mom,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"We moved from SF to Brooklyn almost seven years ago and completely blindsided by the primary school enrollment process. Our zoned school was good, but after touring PS 295 for prek, we just felt this school had something special. We did not get in right away, but the minute we got the call, we moved from our zoned school to 295. School had already started. We've been at 295 ever since and I feel my kids have grown up so much here. We have one in first and another in fourth. It's their second home. 

It's a very warm, welcoming group of parents and teachers who work hard to provide anything our kids may need.  

Our programs and events are amazing! Every year, I look forward to seeing the kids perform in the dance festival, and now that my oldest is going into fifth grade, watching him in the school play next year. We have full-time science, drama and art teachers! Touch a Truck, Brooklyn Boogie Brunch, our Halloween Danceathon, the new Silent Art Auction coming up and not to mention Spirit Week, Field Day, Earth Day and the Spring Arts Festival. There's a lot going on at this school! 

I think our kids are getting a well-rounded education at 295. In addition, because we have such a strong community, they, too, are learning to be active participants and are often encouraged to jump in and help when they see parents volunteering at the school, or hear about a family in need.

I can't say enough what this school has meant to us. It definitely made the transition of moving from CA to NY easier!

The service providers for my special needs child are incredible and I don't feel that I have to fight to receive any of the services she needs.

She is a thoughtful and reflective instructional leader who works collaboratively with teachers, students and parents. She is a warm person who makes every student feel known, understood, listened to and loved. She has innovative ideas for how to accomplish the school's educational goals, and she keeps the school's good practice and progressive pedagogical vision in the foreground even as she tries to balance it with the often contrary demands that come from the DOE. She prioritizes enrichment opportunities like the arts and respects the different learning styles that naturally occur among a school full of children, particularly a population as diverse as 295. Her goal seems to be to think deeply and reflect continually with her staff in order to provide enough range that all children can find ways to learn and thrive.

15K295,Dan,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"Hi Christine,

PS 295 is still going strong! We just held our 
third annual Touch-a-Truck fundraiser last weekend, our student-run 
Farmers Market is re-opening for the season this Thursday afternoon, and
 we'll close out the week with our Outdoor Dance Festival on Friday 
morning. It's events like these that show our community at its best.

As
 far as core academics go, we're still in a great place: experienced, 
effective teachers with low staff turnover, and a continued commitment 
to a workshop classroom model and Teachers College best practices. Our 
kids didn't enjoy the state tests any more than any other school's, but 
they seemed to handle the stress well and feel as prepared as they could
 be. Our learning environment surveys show high satisfaction among 
parents and a real sense that the school is responsive to the needs and 
priorities of parents.

One thing we're excited about is our Arts 
Committee, which is taking a holistic view of arts programming across 
the school, from classes to after-school to field trips and such, and 
looking for new opportunities to bring in outside groups and incorporate
 new kinds of experiences into the school day. Our band and choral music
 programs continue to be popular among kids and their parents, and every
 child in the school takes music classes of some kind every week. 

We're
 currently going through a transition in leadership as our principal, 
Deanna Marco, is leaving to start a new school on Staten Island--a 
lifelong dream for her. We're sorry to see her go, but the process for 
interviewing new candidates involved a lot of thought and discussion on 
the kinds of things that make PS 295 as successful as it is, what we 
care about most, and what we want for the school in the years ahead. It 
was inspiring to hear the commitment and enthusiasm for the school 
showed by both parents and staff, and to feel like we're all part of 
something special together. We're confident that our new principal (who 
should be named in the next few weeks) will share our vision and build 
on the strong foundation laid by Deanna and those before her.

15K295,Jean,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"We have had a wonderful experience at 295. My daughter attended 295 from kindergarten through 5th grade, and my son is now in 3rd grade at the school. PS 295 is a small, supportive, and diverse community, a place where all of the teachers at the school seem to know all of the children by name, whether they've had them in their classes or not. My childrens' teachers have been exceptional: attentive, dedicated and skilled at addressing students of varying abilities, and my daughter was extremely well prepared for middle school. 

Like every other public school in the city, PS 295 has weathered budget cuts. But the administration and staff have done an excellent job of maintaining a strong arts focus in the school, with visual arts, movement/ dance, and drama classes woven into the curriculum. And though class size has not been as small as when we first came to the school, I believe that the same is true for public schools across the board, and the administration has done a good job  trying to maintain a small class size when possible. 

The PTA at the school is a very active, dedicated and welcoming group that has worked on a number of fundraising initiatives -- including a grant that brought a music program to the school -- as well as a string of community events that bring families to the school to socialize. In the 7 years that our family has been at the school, we have found it to be a welcoming community and a place where students are treated with respect and encouragement. ",1,0,0,2012-02-26T19:55:10,1.0,0.098,0.33799999999999997,0.005,0.687,0.071,0.391,0.096,0.076,0.40399999999999997,0.369,0.128

I agree with other posters that 295 had more ""stuff"" when my first child started there - there have been a number of years of cutbacks since then and while the PTA is active in fundraising the school has definitely felt the loss of funds.  I imagine many schools are in similar situations.  The music program has been a great plus recently as are the after school instrument lessons.

As for bullying, even one kid being bullied is too many and the school is definitely responsible for controlling the environment to prevent that.  But, I wouldn't want readers to think it's a common problem at 295.  I've been a parent there for 9 years and I don't think it is.

No school is perfect, and I know that 295 has its troubles - I'd point out the loss of small class sizes in the upper grades and not enough outdoor time as some of my pet peeves.  But overall, it's been a wonderful place for my kids to grow in and I will be sorry to leave when my daughter graduates.",2,0,0,2012-02-16T03:46:43,1.0,0.098,0.33799999999999997,0.005,0.687,0.071,0.391,0.096,0.076,0.40399999999999997,0.369,0.128

15K295,anonymous,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"This is not the school anymore that is described above.  We started going to ps295 because it was our zoned school and it seemed to make sense and we were impressed with what it was when we went on the tour.  
When we started going there in 2005, there was a full dance floor and students in the 4th and 5th grade were learning choreography notation. There was an extra teacher paid for by the magnet grant who was teaching the teachers how to integrate art into the curriculum.  There was a fabulous drama teacher who had specialized in Shakespeare and was aspiring to teach that to the kids.  

By the time we left this was all gone.  After my son had been in Kindergarten, the fabulous dance teacher left.  We had a not so good teacher for a year during which the dance floor that was fabulous was cut in half to make two rooms.  We got a great dance teacher again for 2nd and 3rd grade but she had to leave because of conflicts with the administration. All the kids literally loved her.  Due to budget cuts, one of the existing teachers became the dance/fitness teacher.  Don't need to say that she was definitely not a dance teacher. Student teachers were hired to get some dance in which was great but still not what it was.  

The same year the great drama teacher left because she was made to have the kids perform musicals instead of Shakespeare and unfortunately the really fantastic science teacher who my son loved and was a true science teacher and (again) was replaced with a teacher who had already been totally uninspiring and was not much better when she was a science teacher.  The drama teacher was replaced by a real drama teacher who was unfortunately regularly pretty cranky. 

There were times when I picked my son up and he would tell me that either the drama teacher or dance teacher had yelled at them that they were no good at all.  The daughter of a friend of mine is terrified to audition because of this drama teacher even if she loved the theatre.  

On top of it my son got bullied and even if some attention was paid to it, I don't think it was enough. And truthfully, I believe the over-discipline that is currently applied in the school could be the source of the bullying.  Kids have very very little freedom and start doing things more secretly.  

The teachers were all really great people and that was our saving grace really.  If the classroom teachers wouldn't have been so good, I think I would have really made my son leave and we would have gone somewhere else.  He is in the charter school now and doing great, his grades are way up, and he loves the school.  

My advise though is, think twice before you go to this school.  It is not anymore the art school it once was.  Totally not.  Testing has become more important than art.  ",1,0,0,2012-01-31T01:42:57,1.0,0.098,0.33799999999999997,0.005,0.687,0.071,0.391,0.096,0.076,0.40399999999999997,0.369,0.128

** A friend of mine at the school had technical difficulties posting this reply so I'm posting it for her:

As a
parent who currently has 2 children at PS 295 (1st & 5th), I feel like I
need to respond to the comment above. Many of the hirings and leavings referred
to happen 3-5 years ago, and are basically old news. It’s also important to
understand the larger context. A lot of us who have been part of the NYC school
system since 2005 or so have seen many programs, jobs & resources cut
drastically in the past 4 years. This is not the fault of the schools, and in
my opinion, PS 295 has been incredibly creative with every dollar they have at
their disposal in channeling it right back into smaller class sizes, boosting
curriculum, and the arts!

For example, when the dance room was cut in half, it was done so in order to
give the drama program its own dedicated room. The “student teacher” is
actually a dance educator who just happens not to be certified by the DOE. She
is paid for by the PTA, because (as the original poster noted) budget cuts made
it necessary to cut the dance teacher. To my mind, this was a clever and practical
way to keep dance instruction in our curriculum in the face of huge financial
cuts. The dance instructor teaches the kids AND she does professional
development with our Creative Movement/PE teacher. 


 


The
uninspiring science teacher is no longer at the school. Our current science
teacher is wonderful; my 5th grader comes home talking about the
exciting experiments they do, and wants to replicate them! I’m not sure it’s
fair to say that the “great” drama teacher left because she couldn’t stand
doing musicals instead of Shakespeare (and for what it’s worth, my 5th
grader had her too, and complained that SHE yelled all the time. He never says
that about our current drama teacher.) This year, the kids performed
Charlotte’s Web. The whole school studied the book and talked about it in light
of friendship, and it was a wonderful performance. I’m not sure Shakespeare is
really the best way to get 4-10 year olds excited about drama, to be honest.
There’s plenty of time for 400-year-old tragedies in middle/high school. 


 


I
can only speak from personal experience, but I have not seen actual bullying
happen at PS 295. It certainly could have happened, but I don’t think it’s a
widespread problem by any means. I’m not sure what over-discipline means. I do
know that the school uses positive behavioral reinforcement in and out of the
classrooms, and that has helped my son develop empathy & reflect on his
behavior, instead of feeling defensive or unfairly punished. I would not agree
with the statement that kids have very little freedom; personally I’m not sure
what freedom they are supposed to have at that age, during school time. 


 


One
more thing: “Testing has become more important than art.” Here are the facts:
3-5 graders get one 10 week cycle of test prep as part of the Academic
Intervention Services (tutoring) that the whole school receives. That’s three
50 minute periods a week for 10 weeks; it seems reasonable to me given the
importance of the tests for their own academic future. No one loves tests
(okay, everyone hates them), but that’s the reality we all face now, and it’s
also a change in the DOE system since the olden days the original poster was
talking about. 


 


On
the “arts” side, kids get three 50 min periods a week for the entire year:
drama, creative movement & art; plus another period/week of music for 15
weeks. That’s not counting the band program for 4-5 graders (the school
supplies a wide range of brass & woodwind instruments), the drama
performance, or the school lunch clubs, of which several are arts-related. Every
foot of the school building is decorated with student artwork, and the Spring
Arts Festival is still one of our biggest events of the year. You do the math
and decide whether arts are still important at PS 295. 


 


My
point here is that everyone’s experience is different, and no school is perfect
for every child (or family), but there are two sides to every coin. I think
that both sides should be looked at and considered before judgments are made. My
family’s experience at PS 295 has been wonderful; both my husband and I are in
creative professions, and love the school’s dedication to the arts alongside its
academic rigor, and the teachers’ and administration’s clear devotion to the
kids. My two very different children have had two different experiences, as
befits the individualization of teaching that goes on at PS 295, but the arts
have been a huge part of their daily school lives in both cases, and I am
thankful for that in this era of cutbacks and reductions.

15K295,Dan,brooklyn,Elementary,396,"We came into PS 295 by way of its CTT program, which wasn’t offered by our zoned school. Our son is now in his second year at the school, and both the first and second grade CTT classes have been outstanding: both good Gen Ed teachers and good Special Ed teachers, as well as dedicated paraprofessionals in each class. Although the classes have been fairly large, we’ve never had the sense that our son had got lost in the crowd. The same is true for the school in general—its small size means that pretty much every adult in the building knows his name, and we couldn’t ask for a more supportive environment for him.  He’s made great progress on his IEP, both in the classroom and in his services. His teachers really “get” him, and we feel he’s both well-supported in areas where he needs it, like staying on-task and improving his writing, and consistently challenged to work beyond grade level in his areas of strength, especially reading and math. At a time when CTT can seem like an endangered species in District 15, we take a lot of comfort in the school’s consistent commitment to the program. 

Meanwhile, our daughter is currently in her first year at PS 295, which she entered for K after spending pre-K in our zoned school (primarily to have both kids in the same school—she’s not on an IEP). She’s having a great time, and has recently turned the corner in learning to read. While we hope she’ll end up in the school’s CTT classes in future years (as a Gen Ed student), since we like that classroom model, we’re confident in the quality of education she’ll get no matter which class she’s in.

My daughter has learned to love math, reading and writing from her dedicated teachers. Learning is FUN here; she knows all the major bones (something I didn't learn until high school biology!!) by pasting a skeleton onto a Halloween drawing and identifying each bone by writing its name. PS 295 is one of just seven NYC schools to receive a grant from Slow Food, which was used to build raised beds and to plant all kinds of herbs and vegetables; what a great learning experience... kids from every grade level tend the garden, which thrived over the hot summer thanks to volunteer students and their parents. The PTA's first meeting this year included pesto and lemon balm tea made from the garden. The PTA is welcoming to newcomers and is comprised of dedicated parents who do everything they can to make the school even better.

15K418,Brooklyn parent,brooklyn,Elementary,258,"The statistics for the Children's School are extremely confusing.  It says 187 children attend, but in fact it's closer to 500.  And if you look under special education it says N/A for ICT, whereas in fact every class in the school is ICT.  The challenge is that the Children's School is actually a partnership between district 15 and district 75, and the school actually has two DOE numbers -- I believe 15K418 and 75K372.  This is why it's so hard to get stats for the full school population.  I'm a potential Children's School parent, and this district split is making it impossible to find accurate data on demographics, on test scores, on anything.  Is this something Insides Schools can look into?  It seems like a really wonderful place, but I'd really like the full picture.

15K418,Brooklyn Mom,brooklyn,Elementary,258,"My son attended PS 372 from Kindergarten through Fourth
grade.  As a teacher I know that one sign
of a successful school is whether or not the teachers want their own children
to attend the school. I know of several teachers who have their kids in the
school.  In my experience for the most
part the team teaching model worked. Sometimes it was amazing and some times it
was good. The plus is that there are two to three adults in every classroom.
The negative is that there can be students with attention or impulse control
issues who distract the class. Keep in mind that those students can be in a
“regular” classroom as well. The arts programing is wonderful. There is music,
dance, art and some grade levels write, produce and perform an opera.

 

As the parent of a student with an IEP I would say that the
OTs are great and that there seemed to be more trouble with the Speech
Therapists. You will need to continue to advocate for your child and be sure
that everyone is aware of any accommodations for teaching or testing that are
needed. Honestly, I did hear of a few teachers who were not very good, but that
will be true in any institution. I would highly recommend the school.",0,0,0,2014-10-18T19:20:50,1.0,0.012,0.105,0.0,0.9490000000000001,0.012,0.17800000000000002,0.14,0.039,0.147,0.628,0.075

 - The teachers are great, they are really interested in what they do 
 - The environment of the school is kind and encouraging, the teachers and other staff really like the kids.
 - Mastery-based grading, this means that grades on assignments and school work allow children to know if they are meeting the standard/goal or maybe still approaching or even exceeding.  For real, when kids are ""approaching"" the standard they are given many opportunities to gain mastery. And they feel good about it.
 - Great after school programs
 - Diversity, a wonderful mix of kids from all backgrounds
 - Most importantly, our daughter is happy in school, interested in what she is learning!

He comes home completely lit up about science and math. We just had parent teacher conferences and the teachers talked about what a science kid he is and were shocked when we said that we hadn't actually known that until this year-it's something that they've inspired (lots of hands on experiments and really cool collaborative projects across the curriculum). They pull them out in small group intensives so they have the chance to focus on things they need more time with or alternately explore something on a deeper level if they're ready for more. I loved that during the conference each subject teacher had a plan specifically for my son-this is what we think  he's ready for so we're planning to start him on this, etc. it's so individually geared to each student. Definitely room for kids to stretch intellectually and they're encouraged to do so. My son is on the quieter side and I had been worried that he'd sit back in a bigger school and potentially get lost-442 has been great about encouraging him to put himself forward. He  loves it and is so comfortable and happy and motivated there. In addition to ELA they have three periods a week of basically free reading which I think is huge for literacy. And in addition to math, they have another class called problem solving. And very cool afterschools.

Trust me, I'm an 8th grader attending at this school and let me tell you this; it's academic efficiency is horrible and pretty flawed.

But the other 90% of students are failing the grade with an approximate 1.9 GPA, which is negatively stunning and pretty disgraceful towards the education system. I can do my work easily and accurately, very quickly without assistance from the teachers. But the other 90% of students ALWAYS need help from the teachers. If your a parent of an extremely intelligent child, don't send him or her to this school. If your a parent of a child who usually needs help from his or her's teacher(s), this school can assist them well but the child still needs to have accurate positive independent capability, meaning he or she should be able to complete their work correctly on their own. Other than that, this school is still flawed. I give this school a 3/10, in terms of rating. Deanna Sinito needs to spend more time inside her office so students can get a more comfortable adjustment to the school, contibuted with their independence; this is my advice for the principal in the future.

My 12th year daughter is currently (2011-2012)
attending MS 442 and is thriving in the sixth grade. In part, I give credit to
the nurturing and “thinking outside the box,” education pedagogical environment
that MS 442 created, and the herculean dedication, patience, cultural-economic sensitivity,
innovative, and tolerance of the teachers, and all staff.  

Due to the encouragement and support of her Art/Music,
ELA, Math, and Science teachers at MS 442, my daughter was accepted and will be
attending the American Museum of Natural History’s (in NYC) Wildlife Forensics
Institute and Evolution Institute for this Summer 2012 and Fall 2012. She is
striving to be a Doctor of Veterinarian Medicine when she grows up, just like
her great grandfather in Mexico.    

Moreover, my daughter has maintained a 95% grade
point average or above at MS 442 as she did in the past at PS 29. Both her grade
point average and test level scores, earned her an invitation to take the
Hunter College High School, Anderson School exams, participate in the DREAM Initiative
(sponsored by the DOE), and had been accepted to the Brooklyn Friends School
for two straight years. Her 4th grade and 5th grade State
scores in New York and Florida State were all perfect 4s in all subjects. 

In all, I am both appreciative and I am grateful for
MS 442 attitude towards creating a better and accepting world towards others
(of all educational needs) through social and educational integration. 

As a Mexican single parent (by choice), university
professor with a Ph.D. in Anthropology-Gender and Development, and a person
with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), I count and
expect the faculty at MS 442 to work in partnership with me in keeping my
daughter curious, inventive, safe, hopeful, and strengthening her critical learning
skills. To date, the teachers and staff have managed to keep their doors open
to any new suggestions and ideas.

He is really one of those students who has SO MUCH Potential, and just does not utilize it. I am a single parent and try to assist him in every way possible, but I have to admit that somedays I am just plain tired and school was so easy for me that it can frustrate me when he doesn't ""get it"" like Math. He placed in the gifted and talented for his 4th grade scores, but I knew he was not ready. he needs determination and motivation and me talking about college and life does not work. 

I have read through these reviews and while I thought based on testing this was not a great school, I actually think this may be the perfect environment for him. I am hoping that he can instill the motivation he so desperately needs, and the fact that there are other activities, such as chess and drama, available to him. He stays after school on Thursdays now for the chess club at the library. 

My only question is what happened between 2009 and 2010 to make test scores drop so low? I have researched and cannot come up with anything.

I, too, had to transfer my child with an IEP from another school to 442. Prior to transfer, my son was depressed, dismal, grades failing and all you described your son to go through. 
Upon admission to 442, along with attentive teachers and smaller classrooms, my son was able to improve his grades and now taking accelerated science. Also, The recent implementing of UNIFORMS have instilled a sense of responsibility, TEAMWORK and Proudness for the school.
This ""GHETTO"" you speak of? Its CARROLL GARDENS, one of the best neighborhoods in BK. I live in Carroll Gardens- There are OTHER JHS in the area, BTW.

15K442,Parent,brooklyn,Middle,302,"Do not send your child to this school. This is a dumping ground for kids the Board of Ed. wants to pull out of their neighborhood schools for disciplinary and learning disability issues. It is the classic ""Ghetto"" for troubled students, and the vast majority behave worse in 8th grade than they do in 6th. Just walk with the students on any given afternoon as they leave the school and walk down to the subway stop at Carroll Street. You will hear every single curse word in the book and more. You will see students seething with aggression and negativity.

The whole concept of the school is flawed and it needs to be closed. Do not listen to advisers who want to trick you into placing your child there. They all work by quota, and God help you if your child is one of the unlucky ""mainstream"" children corralled in as window-dressing. My child was previously in Special Ed. classes, but was mainstreamed by 2nd grade with an hour or two of therapy a week and a one-to-one paraprofessional in the classroom. These supports were pulled in 5th grade and he did tremendously well. He listed 442 as his sixth and last choice for middle school, mostly to appease the guidance counselor who kept trying to steer him there, and that's where he ended up. 6th grade was a disaster from beginning to end. His grades plummeted, his behavior deteriorated, his entire attitude became dark and morose, just like nearly all the other students there. I cannot emphasize what a nightmare it was. In 5th grade my son won awards for most improved student and best student in two subject areas. By the end of sixth grade, he was nearly failing all of his subjects except gym, and the last day of school he punched a student who had been bullying him all year and threatened the staff. We rode home together in a police car. Everyone was telling me to pretend he was hit by another student to get him transferred but I didn't. I fought honestly, I raised hell, I talked to everyone I could, I wrote letters, emails, made phone calls went to offices...until they tired of seeing me and let my son transfer to his neighborhood school a week before the start of 7th grade. He is doing wonderfully there despite the regression he suffered at 442, has no Special Ed. services at all, no disciplinary problems and an average above 80 in his courses. All of his problems in 6th grade were a direct result of being placed in MS 442.As my son himself said, MS 442 is like Jurassic ParK: an experiment gone wrong. If they aren't treating the kids like prisoners by using collective punishment, they are making accommodations for every infraction and academic difficulty, such that no one is challenged to improve and any sense of justice is completely absent. My heart goes out to the kids who are stuck there. Society has given up on them and warehoused them in a segregated waiting room for prison. Don't let this happen to your child. Don't list it on the application. Not 4th, not 5th, not 6th. Don't list it at all. And if your child is there already, go to war on your child's behalf and get them out. The damage can be reversed if you act quickly enough.",1,0,0,2012-05-22T22:32:48,0.75,0.036000000000000004,0.348,0.003,0.76,0.033,0.275,0.08900000000000001,0.146,0.295,0.434,0.13

It’s amazing to me they still place the kids in good high schools but that’s probably due to the parents.

15K443,Jeanne,brooklyn,Middle,580,"My child was there last year for the 6th grade, but we chose to transfer to another school.  When we toured the school, the administration was very clear that it didn't focus on test scores and took kids across the spectrum.  I really liked that because I believe our kids have to learn to live in the world - not just in the world of students who score 4s. My child was a high performer.  Unfortunately, the school year started with the teachers focusing on prepping for the state tests in April.  At Back to School night, every single academic teacher said, ""this is how we will prep them for the tests."" There was no development of critical thinking skills in the curriculum.  Daily scores for homework, quizzes and tests were logged.  Bigger projects were not designed for collaborative or critical thinking.  In fact, the project work seemed as rote as the daily grind. Even months into the school year, the teachers didn't know who my child was.  Once concerned with social development, I reached out to the guidance counselor and did not receive a return call.  My child wasn't engaged or happy about going to school any more.  That is all the negative.  On the positive front, the school community is tight.  The PA has worked extremely hard to improve the school with technology and other additions.  I do believe the Principal works his tail off to improve the school - and he does it with a wide spectrum of learners versus the other neighborhood schools (which only take the top performers).  I believe the school will be great someday but is in transition to that greatness.  To get there, the parents will need to demand a more engaging curriculum, one in which the entire school day isn't focused on getting ready for the state tests. To get there, the parents will need to be more involved than they currently are (save the tireless group that gives so much!).  To get there, the school might need to think about how to educate the broad spectrum so that the high performers are challenged while the low performers are rising - perhaps advanced classes should be in the mix.  The arts program is fantastic - all around.  Dance, graphic arts, art, theater and music -- the teachers are extremely talented and also capable teachers. At the end of the day, I didn't want my child to get lost in that transition and so we left the school.",1,0,0,2015-11-23T17:40:41,0.75,0.017,0.221,0.0,0.9,0.021,0.233,0.064,0.07400000000000001,0.295,0.528,0.10300000000000001

The physical environment at NV is excellent- the auditorium is great, and they keep the whole school very clean and orderly. There is no bullying or drug use in the school.  While the ability of students varies a lot, the school is serious about academics, and pushes all the kids to improve.  The school's arts classes set it apart from other schools and they provide an amazing opportunity for sixth graders to have instruction in dance, chorus, art, and music all in one year. 

 As parents we had a bit of a culture shock coming to NV because our elementary school was a very progressive environment with tons of parent involvement in all aspects of the school.  At NV we have the feeling that they prefer parents to stay out of the way.  They give you very little information about the curriculum, and you will have only 10 minutes per semester to meet with each teacher, and those sessions are very chaotic. You wont be told why they cut foreign language classes. You wont find kids getting involved in raising money for disasters in Japan or Haiti like in other schools, or the teachers using current events to inform a lesson.  They are not going to be very concerned about healthy lunches or composting or things like that.

15K447,M.H.,brooklyn,Middle,545,"This is a superb middle school. It prepares students to think critically, a skill needed by all citizens no matter their occupation, and it prepares students for the most rigorous high schools in the city. The student body was diverse and included a strong cohort of special needs children so the students learned to navigate a classroom with diverse learning styles. My children loved it and were well prepared for elite/specialized high schools in the city. 
   For parents of bright, curious, engaged children entering the middle school application process, here is the DL on evaluating the quality of teaching (critical thinking, learning key concepts and applying them) and preparation at a middle school:
Part I:
   
Science: Are the children writing proper lab reports all 3 years of school, with hypothesis, methods, results, discussion, etc.? Typed or handwritten is fine, but you should be able to see examples on the walls outside classrooms. My kids did 5 or 6 lab reports a year. They were taught in 6th grade how to do this and practiced it regularly. Result: they arrived at elite high schools and their written scientific expression was spot on.
   
Math: Look for differentiated math instruction. What kind of cool problem solving is provided for curious students? Or, is it only teaching to the test? 
   
Social studies: Students should be writing 2 big papers a semester in 8th grade. Typed or handwritten is fine; properly sourced (primary and secondary sources) with in-text citations and works cited page; and a proper thesis embedded in a logical introduction. Thesis ideally is of the student’s own choosing by second semester 8th grade and not responding to a teacher prompt (to promote higher order thinking). MS 447 is superb with this and it shows in high school. Your student will be told in 9th grade in the specialized HSs that they were supposed to have learned how to write in middle school and the high school will not teach them to write. High school teachers (with a handful of exceptions) will not line edit or developmentally edit. If it was not learned in middle school…. 
   
English: Again, plenty of writing practice and differentiated reading groups with flexibility to move ahead and feed a hungry reader. See Part II below.",1,0,0,2018-11-29T15:22:50,0.75,0.011000000000000001,0.244,0.0,0.591,0.017,0.193,0.11,0.114,0.204,0.532,0.042

15K447,M.H.,brooklyn,Middle,545,"This is Part II of the DL on evaluating middle schools:

Ultimately, in middle school you have 2 goals as a parent. 

(Goal 1) Be  vigilante about the drug/drinking/digital device addiction culture. Contrary to preconceptions, it is not children from under-resourced households who present the greatest risk for these behaviors, it is children from middle class and prosperous homes whose parents are neglectful that present the greatest risk. Those children have the resources to bully other children into poor behavior and they try. Their parents are the ones talking about “good parenting” while in reality both parents work their butts off to pay for summer vacations in Europe while they let digital devices and too much pocket change babysit their latchkey kids. District 15 has many super ambitious families like this and these parents just hit the lottery jackpot because now their misbehaved children have a better chance to get into middle schools because the behavioral assessments were removed. Do not believe what the middle schools may tell you about their “safe” school, etc. All middle schools have drug/device problems, but the schools without behavior assessments had it far worse, but it is always concealed from public view. In one year you will believe me.
(Goal 2) Pay attention to the development of critical thinking in your child. Your children’s straight A’s in middle school will only open the door to an interview and assessment test seat for a top high school in NYC. If your child’s straight A’s reflect his/her ability to parrot back what they were taught, it is too late in 8th grade to teach your kid to be curious and think critically using a solid foundation of facts and skills. Your kid will not get a seat at those elite high schools. You cannot prep that kind of critical thinking. It is learned in school and at home. period.

Beware the middle schools that place your kid in some kind of team learning group or crew for a whole year. Strong students will be placed with weaker students to help the weaker learners. This is the school wanting your child to do the school’s job for them. Learning groups are fine but should be rotated regularly. Bright children should NOT be placed to help weaker students. The strong student simply does not progress the way they could. Instead the stronger and weaker students should each be given differentiated instruction so they get an education appropriate for their needs. One group is not more deserving than the other. That is simply equity in education. Wait until halfway through 6th grade and your strong student comes home complaining about the misbehaved student in their group who does not work and your kid does all the work. If you have a bright kid, this WILL happen---it’s just that in an equitable arrangement, the kids switch groups. Lock a strong kid in with a misbehaved kid all year in a group of 4 or 5…that’s just pure torture and you will be beside yourself. MS 447 uses these groups. It’s a fact of life in middle school. But…MS 447 rotates them frequently, thank goodness. Your kid’s misery will be short-lived. 

All of us veteran parents in the district have a clear sense of which middle schools are the rote memorization traditional schools, which combine critical thinking with a strong practice on foundational skills and facts, and the schools falling somewhere on the curve in between. Beware glowing school websites and high-flown language of school administrators. You need to pay attention to student work in the hallways and compare and contrast. Frankly, a couple of years ago I was touring a ""competitive"" high school smack in the middle of Park Slope. I saw a bulletin board of 9th grade science lab reports: one page, handwritten, garbled hypothesis, rambling abstract, no discussion or methods section. The 6th grade lab reports at 447 were simply better, by a substantial measure. I spoke with the 9th grade science teacher at the school and he said outright that his students were not capable of writing such a report. The buck stops with the parent. You need to pay attention for evidence testifying to the rigor of a MS curriculum. Schools like 447 are happy to showcase their student work in the hallways. You are going to learn next year very quickly where your kid landed in the curriculum lottery of District 15. Middle school is 3 super critical years: it is preparation for high school; it is not remediation for DOE failures from elementary school. 
All middle schools are not the same, and you will understand this concept well by November of your child’s freshman year in high school.",1,1,1,2018-11-29T15:34:30,0.75,0.011000000000000001,0.244,0.0,0.591,0.017,0.193,0.11,0.114,0.204,0.532,0.042

15K447,M.H.,brooklyn,Middle,545,"This is a superb middle school. It prepares students to think critically, a skill needed by all citizens no matter their occupation, and it prepares students for the most rigorous high schools in the city. The student body was diverse and included a strong cohort of special needs children so the students learned to navigate a classroom with diverse learning styles. My children loved it and were well prepared for elite/specialized high schools in the city. 
     For parents of bright, curious, engaged children entering the middle school application process, here is the DL on evaluating the quality of teaching (critical thinking, learning key concepts and applying them) and preparation at a middle school:
   
  Science: Are the children writing proper lab reports all 3 years of school, with hypothesis, methods, results, discussion, etc.? Typed or handwritten is fine, but you should be able to see examples on the walls outside classrooms. My kids did 5 or 6 lab reports a year. They were taught in 6th grade how to do this and practiced it regularly. Result: they arrived at elite high schools and their written scientific expression was spot on.
  
   Math: Look for differentiated math instruction. What kind of cool problem solving is provided for curious students? Or, is it only teaching to the test? 
 
    Social studies: Students should be writing 2 big papers a semester in 8th grade. Typed or handwritten is fine; properly sourced (primary and secondary sources) with in-text citations and works cited page; and a proper thesis embedded in a logical introduction. Thesis ideally is of the student’s own choosing by second semester 8th grade and not responding to a teacher prompt (to promote higher order thinking). MS 447 is superb with this and it shows in high school. You should be looking for this on the walls outside classrooms. In 8th grade, you should see some pretty nice thesis arguments at the end of introductions. Your student will be told in 9th grade in the specialized HSs that they were supposed to have learned how to write in middle school and the high school will not teach them to write. High school teachers (with a handful of exceptions) will not line edit or developmentally edit. If it was not learned in middle school…. 
  
  English: Again, plenty of writing practice and differentiated reading groups with flexibility to move ahead and feed a hungry reader.

    Ultimately, in middle school you have 2 goals as a parent:
    (Goal 1) Be vigilante about the drug/drinking/digital device addiction culture. Contrary to preconceptions, it is not children from under-resourced households who present the greatest risk for these behaviors, it is children from middle class and prosperous homes whose parents are neglectful that present the greatest risk. Those children have the resources to bully other children into poor behavior and they try. Their parents are the ones talking about “good parenting” while in reality both parents work their butts off to pay for summer vacations in Europe while they let digital devices and too much pocket change babysit their latchkey kids. District 15 has many super ambitious families like this and these parents just hit the lottery jackpot because now their poorly behaved children have a better chance to get into middle schools because the behavioral assessments were removed. Do not believe what the middle schools may tell you about their “safe” school, etc. All middle schools have drug/device problems, but the schools without behavior assessments had it far worse, but it is always concealed from public view. In one year you will believe me.
    (Goal 2) Your children’s straight A’s in middle school will only open the door to an interview and assessment test seat for a strong high school in NYC. If your child’s straight A’s reflect his/her ability to parrot back what they were taught, it is too late in 8th grade to teach your kid to be curious and think critically using a solid foundation of facts and skills. Your kid will not get a seat at those elite high schools. You cannot prep that kind of critical thinking. It is learned in school and at home. period.
    
 Beware the middle schools that place your kid in some kind of team learning group or crew for a whole year. Strong students will be placed with weaker students to help the weaker learners. This is the school wanting your child to do the school’s job for them. Learning groups are a fact of life but should be rotated regularly. Bright children should NOT be placed to help weaker or inattentive students. The strong student simply does not progress the way they could. Instead the stronger and weaker students should each be given differentiated instruction so they get an education appropriate for their needs. One group is not more deserving than the other. That is simply equity in education. Wait until halfway through 6th grade and your strong student comes home complaining about the misbehaved student in their group who does not work and your kid does all the work. If you have a bright kid, this WILL happen---it’s just that in an equitable arrangement, the kids switch groups. Lock a strong kid in with a misbehaved kid all year in a crew of 4 or 5…that’s just pure torture and you will be beside yourself. MS 447 uses small groups sometimes. But…MS 447 rotates them frequently, thank goodness. Your kid’s misery will be short-lived. 

     All of us veteran parents in the district have a clear sense of which middle schools are the rote memorization traditional schools, which combine critical thinking with a strong practice on foundational skills and facts, and the schools falling somewhere on the curve in between. You are going to learn next year very quickly where your kid really landed in the curriculum lottery of District 15. Tour schools and compare and contrast student projects posted in hallways. A great school like 447 is proud to showcase what their kids can do. Frankly, a couple years ago I saw a 9th grade science lab report posted in the hallway of a ""competitive"" high school smack in the middle of Park Slope (during a HS tour): one page, handwritten, garbled hypothesis, rambling abstract, no discussion or clear methods section. It was inferior to 6th grade lab reports at 447, by a substantial measure. I spoke with the HS science teacher. He admitted his students couldn't prepare such a lab report. So---No school website or high-flown language from school administrators can smooth over that kind of evidence of a weak curriculum. The buck stops with the parent. So look for evidence of quality work from the students at a school. Middle school is 3 super critical years: it is preparation for high school; it is not remediation for DOE failures from elementary school. 
All middle schools are not the same, and you will understand this concept well by November of your child’s freshman year in high school.",0,0,0,2018-11-29T14:33:18,0.75,0.011000000000000001,0.244,0.0,0.591,0.017,0.193,0.11,0.114,0.204,0.532,0.042

15K447,Filler Filler,brooklyn,Middle,545,"OK. I used to go to middle school here and graduated recently. This is going to be a extremely long rant/block of text and I don't really expect anyone to read it in its entirety and depth but I just want to get my thoughts out there. I'm going to be brutally honest in this review.

I have a lot of things to say about MS.447 - both good and bad things. I'm going to start with the pros.

First off, MS.447 has a lot to offer and you can capitalize on them - both academic opportunities and resources. Eighth graders can take up to three regents: Living Environment, Algebra, and U.S. History. There are also four talents you can choose from, Spanish starting in seventh grade, and an Technology program. The quiet room and tech room are also great resources for printing, doing work, etc. The music room, art room, and dance room are all well stocked and pretty nice. There's also the SONYC after school program, which is kind of all of the school's clubs meshed into one. Also, there's a rather interesting Exploration program, which you can love or you can hate.

Now, onto the atmosphere. There's kind of this nice blend at MS.447 combining a chill setting with getting work done. The school is for the most part pretty diverse but I feel like Asians, brown people, and Hispanics are kind of unrepresented. I looked at the inside stats and I feel like they are kind of skewed but I'll get into that later.

Ok, now onto everything else. I'm going to format it in
1. what I liked about it
2. my comments
3. advice I would give to current students

I'm going to start with the academic work here, the biggest thing.

1. As I mentioned earlier, there's this kind of a nice blend of a chill setting with getting work done. Also, there are chances for accelerated regents courses in eighth grade and interesting miscellaneous classes (Talent, Spanish, Tech, Art, and Exploration).

2. Ok some comments. I feel like in a sense the teachers kind of hype everything up, especially with some teachers giving extremely unnecessary long speeches about life skills and discipline. A lot of teachers excessively gave these speeches and they were annoying. The teachers are for the most part extremely nice and willing to help though.

The work here is actually extremely easy - there should no reason why you would fall behind. All you need to do is pay attention in class and do the work. You can literally BS everything and I would actually advise doing so. You save so much time and effort and can still get insanely good grades. Everything you learn in class throughout the whole year can be summed into a few pages. Class consists of a lot of discussions, context, worktime, groupwork, and just doing nothing. Homework and projects should be quick - don't spend too much time on them.
I'll talk more about the different classes later.

3. Advice
- Classes are kind of a joke. Chill and don't be too stressed like I was.
- To do well, just pay attention in class and make sure the content makes sense. Tbh you don't even have to take notes if you don't want to - just understand the material.
- If you get the material, just BS/rush through your classwork/HW. Write a lot - teachers don't really care and will give you full credit if you write a lot. Quantity is key.
- Participate bc it's a big part of your grade. Answer the easy questions, say random stuff, do what you gotta do.

Ok next topic, specific classes.

1. I like the range of classes you can take: the four core subjects, language, talent, tech, and exploration.

2. Comments.

The four core subjects are kind of self explanatory. You learn some and then most of class is spent doing worksheets, group work, or discussions. Spanish is kind of the same but it's kind of a gas. Nobody really learns anything. Classes are so infrequent and it's just learning a word here and there. Tech seems like a cool idea but we literally do nothing. In sixth grade, it's just typing games. Seventh and eighth grade are just projects that you can do in one to two classes and them just chill for the rest of the time. In total, we only covered typing games, Scratch, Stopmotion, basic html in Code Academy, and an hour of code. You don't really learn anything bc classes are only once a cycle.

The four talents are art, dance, drama, and music. You try all four in sixth grade and then choose one to continue in seventh grade. I don't really know that much about art and dance but they have nice rooms. Art gives homework and tests, and dance makes you do a daily journal and gives projects. The drama room is super small and you don't really do anything.

Ok, I was in music so I'm going to talk about it the most. The music room is extremely well stocked. There were a lot of instruments: piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, recorder, clarinet, sax, trumpet, trombone, tuba, guitar, percussion, and maybe a few more. The problem is we literally learned NOTHING. The teacher just made us play pieces the whole time or put us in practicing rooms.

Now to the epitome of what MS.447 is about: exploration. Tbh, I have mixed feelings about it. The whole class is so pointless and meaningless. Just BS your work and enjoy the trips/free time. It's so cringey and the teachers give extraneous speeches about respect and life skills. The expo program has become more organized as I progressed through the grades. But that sadly means less trips and more time stuck in class listening to certain expo teachers drown on in directionless rants.

3. Ok seem what I meant about a long block of text? Here's some advice:
- A lot of the classes are so pointless. Just BS your work, soak in what you want, and chill.
- If you're in music and a beginner, work hard and self teach yourself with the books which are actually pretty good. Future you will thank you.

Lastly, I wanna talk about the whole experience of going to MS.447. I'm just going to skip to comments.

2. Some comments.

There are social groups present. Everybody kind of forms their group of friends (""squad"") midway through sixth grade. You're stuck with your official class for 90% of the day and that can be frustrating. I feel that groups are usually divided by race and gender. Popularity is kind of a thing and since it's such a small school, everybody knows about everything.

Now, the experience of going to MS.447. Tbh it's honestly really sketchy. The area around it is not the safest and the school has more than a few incidents of sketchy stuff. The high school downstairs doesn't help. In my time at MS.447, we had 2 bomb threats, a fire in the auditorium, occasional metal detectors, and a few fights in the high school downstairs.

Ok now MS.447 kind of overdoes its ""No place for hate"" anti-bullying shenanigans. It kind of gets overly excessive, cringey, and annoying. It gets to the point where we talk about this ode on half days, peace and diversity day, and in advisory. It's so pointless and nobody really cares - bullying is not a big deal in school. While bullying is not present, I do admit that subtle racism is. Kids can be pretty ignorant as in probably in any other school.

Ok now onto after school stuff. Since 2014, SONYC has kind of been the main thing and it's ok but tbh, you can't really do much in terms of extracurriculars here. Robotics, computer programming, gardening, etc. are all kind of pointless and just chill time. You gotta do stuff outside of school if you wanna do some extracirriculars, pursue some hobbies, etc. Some of the more legit stuff are yearbook, basketball, wrestling, soccer (somewhat), and student government.

3. Advice
- Life is life lol

Ok. I think I'm done with my excessive rant. Probably no one bothered to read it in its entirety but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

15K447,Math and Science Student,brooklyn,Middle,545,"Hello past MS 447 student

I am an 8th grader now and I would like to expand on your conversation. First off I agree about expo. I think it truly can be an amazing program and be really engaging, however, it needs to be worked on. I think it is the curriculum, even though, like you said it currently gets increasingly organized, it is still jumbled. Many times in a unit you learn the same thing over and over and it is very repetitive; the things that are important and very fun are often quickly rushed through. I partly blame the teachers, since in expo you are moving from class to class the teachers in your new class don't know what really happened in the previous one so sometimes you learn the same thing twice.

Additionally, the expo teacher I have at the moment have split the class up by race, which worries me. He is a new teacher and only came this year. I noticed this on a trip when they asked us to group into our table groups, he then split us up into 2 full groups with 2 table in each group. I quickly realized that all of the hispanics, asians, and african-americans were on this same side and all of the caucasians were on one side. We just did a topic on bioethics and has to construct a lesson to the class - my topic was abortion. I wish they used some of the tips they gave us in our lessons into some of their own, to make them a little more exciting.

Like you said earlier the drama in MS 447 isn't terrible. There isn't really any bullying, yes there is some teasing, but I don't think any MS 447 student truly wants to hurt someone. And, even if they did our school has very extreme measures for bullying. Many times students will get in-school suspension. However, when there are some issues: when there is a shred of drama or conflict it explodes all over our school. Since it is relatively small, news travels fast. And sometimes the teachers find about it too AND PAIR YOU WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND *cough* expo teachers *cough*. But it all depends on who you hang out with.

MS 447 has rigorous programs. It depends on how much you will push yourself. If you end up getting into the Algebra Regents track it will be difficult to keep up if you are not entirely on task. If you kind of breeze through it you would end up with low 60s. However, if you push yourself you could get 98s. It all depends on the workload you choose to do.

The guidance counselors are excellent. Ms. Katz is amazing. She made the terrifyingly grueling middle school transition much easier. I was able to go into meetings with her and talk to her during lunch. She answered all my questions and is very chill.

Tech is different now that you are gone. Mr. McCollum left and now Mr. Loize is the teacher. It is very different know and much more organized. However, I will always miss Mr. McCollum because he was one of the teachers that could understand teenage pubescent hormone filled brains. We are doing a lot of Java and just completed identity safety on social media. My class is progressing much faster than my old class with Mr. McCollum.

I am also in music, *digital high five* and it is extremely boring. However, I have to give Mr. Mullins credit for buying the right books. I started my instrument in the middle of 6th grade and now in the beginning of 8th grade I am able to play high school and college level pieces. However, he needs to get new sheet music, I am so sick of Morning, Largo and Finale. We play those songs on repeat and we still sound horrible. I think there should be some system.

But then again MS 447 is a great school, I have not even mentioned all the great things academically about it. If someone wants me too I will but I did write a little tidbit for Brooklynparent601 right below this.

With a small grade size of 170, MS447 is a small community and the students and teachers all know each other. Most of the teachers are experienced and work to make their lessons interesting.

In terms of academics, it's pretty good. Almost all the eighth graders who take the Living Environment (everybody takes this) or Algebra 1 (half the grade takes this) or U.S. History (about a fifth of the grade takes this) regents pass.

I know about six kids in total from PS130 (my school) and PS230 that received their second choice. Keep in mind these kids are extremely smart. The one from PS230 that I know is in G&T.

This school is very, very, very small and very, very, very competitive. If you are a fourth grader getting ready to apply, and this is your first choice, don't get your hopes too high. I think you should definitely look at Brooklyn Prospect MS707, which is an amazing school that has a lot in common with 447. Also, look at schools like 442.

Girls at the school tend to form cliques and they get a bit dramatic competing with each other over popularity. But that's going to occur at any school.
If you have an issue that has to be addressed with the administration they will sit and talk to you. 
  The  staff in the guidance department are nice, but I wish they did a better job reaching out to parents about special high school programs. I had to take it upon myself to research programs.
When it came down to selecting high schools, I felt somewhat pressured to select Millennium Brooklyn HS. The current principal at Millennium Brooklyn use to be a principal at MS 447. I didn't select the school because it wasn't a good fit for my kid.
The school has a zero tolerance policy against bullying or harassment.
Most of the kids I met over the years were genuinely nice kids, but you'll always come across a few that just want to grow up too fast. Some eighth graders were smoking marijuana, and drinking liquor at friends' parties. So parents, keep an eye on your kids.

15K448,Cathleen Bell,brooklyn,Middle,295,"I'm the parent of an 8th grader who has been at BCS since 6th grade after attending BNS from PreK-Grade 5. I wanted to add a review of the school as we get lots of questions about it.

I'll start by saying that we love BCS - we picked it because of the social justice/interesting curriculum, the small class size, small school size, the intentionally integrated environment, and emphasis on social emotional development (which as a 2nd time middle school parent I think is the #1 most important aspect of the middle school experience). 

The academics are not easy and there isn't grade inflation - but they're not super hard-driving either. Very little homework, which we're grateful for. If your kid is off the charts academically, the projects are interesting and you spend a lot of time thinking about the ""why"" of your learning, but you won't get pushed.  I get the feeling that there's a lot of diversity in how well the kids perform in a class - and there's acceptance of that by the teachers, so that kids don't feel they have to give up on themselves if they're getting a C (which BCS labels ""competent""). We have been frustrated with the new grading system and online communication about it but the administration was quick to respond to parent issues and make changes when it was clear it wasn't working. 

Discipline at the school seems pretty fair. There's restorative justice which they really believe in and practice whole heartedly.

Highlights for my child
Debate - my child has been competing and winning a lot of trophies and awards - really stretches their confidence and intellectual reasoning ability. Also fun and team-oriented. 

Gay Straight Alliance - child participates in this club and gets a lot out of being an ally to this community. Last winter, my kid participated in the largest, youth LGTBQ+ rally held at Stuyvesant HS, drawing GSA clubs from all over the city. 

Soccer - In 6th grade, my child got to school at 7AM 3 days a week to play on an indoor co-ed team. 

Expeditionary Thursdays - it's fun and interesting for the kids to engage in applied learning activities every other week. Also bonding. 

Crew is a safe place and allows my child to develop relationships across many barriers that don't often get crossed. And the crew teacher texts with me all the time - nights/weekends - discussion of picayune social stuff, texting pictures from the school dance, etc. I feel very safe and comfortable talking to him about anything and love that.",0,0,0,2020-02-03T02:29:41,1.0,0.044000000000000004,0.353,0.01,0.915,0.125,0.522,0.02,0.285,0.40700000000000003,0.254,0.33799999999999997

What many BCS choose not to take is the 6-8 grade state ELA and math assessments -- that is true. The vast majority of BCS families boycott the state tests; the school's published test scores do not represent the deep learning taking place inside. Also, grades 9-12 only take the English Regents and not the other Regents (considered low-quality tests; even the Board of Regents thinks so and has been considering overhauling them).",1,0,1,2019-10-31T14:01:50,1.0,0.044000000000000004,0.353,0.01,0.915,0.125,0.522,0.02,0.285,0.40700000000000003,0.254,0.33799999999999997

15K448,D.H.,brooklyn,Middle,295,"I am a new parent at the school. My 6th grader loves school so much that he asks to be woken up early to arrive well before school starts (this def did not happen in his elementary days)! The teachers and staff respect and listen to students. The small class sizes are a godsend and almost unheard of in an NYC public school. The school prioritizes that and it makes a difference. The school follows the EL Education model of expeditionary learning, and student led inquiry, along with a Crew model (small group of 12-14 kids plus one advisor who meet for 30 mins daily for social/emotional/team building support). They ask students to take ownership of their work and learning - while constantly receiving support and guidance from teachers (Motto: ""We are crew, not passengers""). The school holds SLCs -Student Led conferences - where students present and reflect on their work to their parents and teachers (rather than Parent-Teacher Conferences that leave the student out). The ""Collaborative"" in the name means it! Collaboration is a core principle of the school - students learn how to work with others in teams and group work, which IMO is very important in life.

Note if you are looking at the ""How do students perform academically"" section above, which is based on the NYState test scores  - the State now gives the lowest rank to students who Opt Out as a way to punish schools with a high Opt Out rate (it used to be logged as N/A, but starting in 2018 the state decided to give a 0-1 score for students not taking the test). Even though NYC City Council and ESSA have reaffirmed that parents have the right to opt their children out of state tests, the state is trying to make a point. Brooklyn Collaborative had an 80% Opt out rate in 2018. So take that section/those scores with a grain of salt. Students at BCS take PBATs (performance-based assessments which measure different aspects of learning) throughout the year.
Also, a better metric for a high school - for the past 2 years 100% of students graduated and most enrolled in 4 year colleges. And the DOE ranked BCS in the highest category for ""school quality.""

The enrollment is way up as parents realize the value of a smaller middle/high school experience where every teacher and staff member truly knows your child. Application #s for 2019-2020 year:
*For incoming Gr 6: 1084 students in D15 elementary schools applied for Grade 6 (class size of 88-90 seats).
*For incoming Gr 9: 950 middle school students applied for Grade 9 (class size of ~102 seats), including 88 of BCS current students who applied to our Grade 9 (that means everyone in Grade 8 applied) 

The school recently released a Unity Statement with the sister school in the same building (BNS 146 elementary) demonstrating our shared values. 
The school also recently was recognized once again on US News and World Report's Best High School list.

15K448,Annalisa Hill Loeffler,brooklyn,Middle,295,"BCS is EXTRAORDINARY. If I tried to review in a single post, it would
probably be 10 pages long, so I'll just post at various times and stick to a
single subject each time. 

Today's topics: Teacher Dedication and Technology Use
(OK, this one's a two-fer - I've got a big backlog!)

Teacher Dedication
My son just started his second year there, and I have been particularly impressed (already!) by the dedication of his Social Studies teacher, who texted parents the day before classes began to say that ""almost daily"" we could expect a text from him on work/behavior in class.  In the first week of academic classes, these brief but informative texts have let us know that we still have work to do on a challenge that we were focusing on late last year.  In a ""traditional"" school setting, parents would have been informed only if there was a big problem, or perhaps a smaller shortcoming might have been addressed at Parent-Teacher Conference, long after the issue could have become entrenched.  And even though these are brief texts, imagine: this teacher is doing this FOR EVERY CHILD IN HIS  CLASSES.  This is a HUGE COMMITMENT, and an extraordinary one.  But while the style of dedication is particular to this teacher, the level of dedication is not - each teacher my son has had has shown this level of dedication in their own way.  And furthermore, this excellent leverage of technology is not limited to teachers either, which brings me to my second point:

Technology Use
Both teachers and staff at BCS make excellent use of technology to maintain communications with students' families; through (1) regular email blasts, (2) direct  email communications, (3) a web-based assessment program that allows families access to up-to-the-day information on how their child is doing - both academically and socially, and (4) as most recently evidenced: texts!",4,0,0,2015-09-17T17:28:20,1.0,0.044000000000000004,0.353,0.01,0.915,0.125,0.522,0.02,0.285,0.40700000000000003,0.254,0.33799999999999997
15K448,Guadalupe Muller,brooklyn,Middle,295,"I attended BCS 6-12th grade. I enjoyed every year at bcs. The teachers and staff here are truly amazing, kind, helpful and really do care about their student's success. The environment at BCS is like no other and it is very safe. Although the space is tight and there are not thousands of students, this is a great opportunity to know your classmates and teachers bettet, to build strong relationship that feel like family bonds. Everyone is supportive and cares for one another. No matter what stuggle you are going through there is someone who can listen to you and truly cares, whether it's a teacher, staff or friend. The classes are fun, I offten stuggled in my math classes but I continued to enjoy the class because of my wonderful classmates and amazing teachers who pushed me to do my best. After graduating I worried that I was not ready for college but when I sat in class I knew that bcs had done everything think to prepare me for college. All the skills I learned in class were very helpful, taking notes, writing TIED paragraphs, math skills etc. Besides academic skills bcs has given me skills I now use on a daily base, those are the bcs core values, leadership, being kind, respectful, being open minded,  collaborative etc. Bcs has shaped me to be the person I am now, I know that without the support and great environment at bcs I could not achieved many things like becoming the first in my family to attend college.

15K448,Afsana,brooklyn,Middle,295,"BCS was a community where I felt at home. It was a place filed with people who inspired, understood, and challenged me to be a stronger human being. 

I remember the first day I stepped inside BCS. My principal Alyce Barr had taken me to her office and sat down with me to personally know me and my interests. I also met my teacher and was introduced to the class. Since the beginning, I felt comfortable at BCS. And right away, I found people who cared about me, like my teachers, friends, and college counselor who opened many doors for me. I wouldn't be where I am if it weren't for them!

At BCS, I spent much of my time constantly trying to know the world better by thinking deeply, taking stances, and developing analytical skills. I was blessed with teachers who did not just come to class to deliver information, but who also cared about our personal and academic growth, teachers who were experts in their fields and true partners in learning. Their faith has encouraged me, personally, to take risks outside of my comfort zone and discover my inner voice. The skills I learned makes me feel confident in college, especially in my writing classes, because BCS PBATs prepared us to be strong writers. 

The BCS community is filled with special individuals that care for each other, a community where teachers will stay with you past 6pm to prepare you for an upcoming test or spend hours outside of class giving you feedback and advising you on your PBATs or essays--- all to ensure that you are being pushed to your limit. 

Josh, the college counselor, always made it a top priority to get to know us each one of us since the 9th grade. He sat with us in his office, went over SAT registration and each step of the college process with us, and always made sure that each of us in track to getting the future we wanted and NOTHING less. When I had to write multiple essays for my college applications and I was beyond overwhelmed, he was awake at 1am to help me finish my essays. If there is one person I'd give all my gratitude to, it would be Josh. 

TL; DR: I wouldn't change my high school experience for anything! :) ",1,0,0,2015-08-11T17:50:52,1.0,0.044000000000000004,0.353,0.01,0.915,0.125,0.522,0.02,0.285,0.40700000000000003,0.254,0.33799999999999997

It offers in-depth learning opportunities in core subjects, plus a variety of interesting electives.  Because it is ""Regents Exempt,"" students are able to focus on building skills (research and writing, as well as presenting before groups) that will help them in college, rather than just merely learning what they need for testing purposes.  My son graduated in June 2014 and was able to gain valuable leadership experience through participating in a City-wide Student Council program that BCS had participated in, and he was a member of the Robotics Team.  The professionals at BCS are just that -- real professionals.  They are innovators and dedicated to the kids' success.  Because the school is small, the teachers really get to know the students and can write good letters of recommendation for them when they apply to college, so the students are not merely numbers to them.

   This school has been politicized to a very uncomfortable degree by your well meaning principal, to a point where it is fairly obvious, even from a distance, that questioning of the prevailing political narrative there would probably be met with intolerance as opposed to debate, and that is a criticism currently being heard nationally from unnamed sources at the school.
    I sense the excitement from parents comments below, that they are happy that their kids have become motivated social justice activists of a sort, but I am puzzled that parents aren't equally dismayed by the statistical fact that their kids apparently aren't being adequately prepared for entrance into good colleges or other types of higher education. Too often mediocrity is excused in the name of a ""good cause"" and I urge parents not to fall into that trap: demand better from your school, principal, teachers and sons and daughters.  Ms. Bloomberg, with her political zeal, has sold your kids short academically by not challenging them enough with advanced classes, which are available at other schools.  I am not accusing your principal of anything, but there is such a thing as ""the racism of low expectations"": demand more, much more, from your schools and their administrators.

The class size is small, which creates a wonderful sense of community.

The math teacher is phenomenal and is teaching algebra in a way that excites and motivates my son. He loves most of his other teachers as well, and is constantly challenged and engaged. The principal does an incredible job of creating community, and bringing issues of racism and diversity alive to all of the students without being heavy handed about it.

Social Emotional Learning is a priority for me without sacrificing academics.  My son was engaged with his school work and challenged without feeling overwhelmed and anxious.  The school work is mainly project based and often relevant to real life or to them personally. For example, he had a statistics math project involving researching different colleges and comparing costs, financial aid, etc.... For another math project, he chose to use skiing to illustrate a mathematical concept.  The homework is meaningful and relevant, as opposed to some other (competitive) high schools where students are burdened with hours and hours of busy work.  The teachers encourage students to be independent and to contact them directly if they need any help or have questions.  If my son didn't feel a grade was fair, or he was missing an assignment, he would contact the teacher, or the teacher would contact him.  His teachers were very responsive and he had a great relationship with them. The school places an emphasis on critical thinking and research.  He really enjoyed and learned a lot from his Socratic seminars where he became more confident defending his point of view and also learning to listen to others respectfully.   I went to his parent conferences in November, and was amazed at how well his teachers knew him after only a few months!  This has rarely been my experience at other schools.

I am sorry to hear that this has been your experience at BHS. One thing I know for certain is that the faculty and staff at BHS work extremely hard creating a meaningful learning environment for students - one that is rigorous, inclusive and safe. Your 10th grader’s schedule consists of Global Studies, Living Environment, Trigonometry, Language and Literature, French, Visual Art, and Advisory/Personal Project.  I am certain that coursework, learning experiences and assessments are preparing students for college. The school has recently had a state, district and IB review. We have received rave reviews regarding the quality of instruction, curriculum and the impact we are having on student learning and college readiness. 

Regarding communication,  are you sure you are receiving all communication? Please feel free to reach out to one of the AP's or Principal. In addition to Konstella, which is our main communication hub, you should have received multiple letters from the Principal and AP's throughout the year. In addition, the parent coordinators send out a monthly newsletter to families. Konstella sends regular calendar reminders and the leadership uses it to communicate with families regularly. We also hold multiple morning and afterschool family academy workshops and facilitate a coffee and conversations meeting with leadership multiple times throughout the year.

————-

I was in all the the planning meetings when this plan was designed.  The idea behind this point was absolutely to strength dual language programs in the middle schools and provide access to students who are bilingual but not ELL to ENTER the two DLP programs.  This is why it’s under admissions.  

Doing it after admissions makes no sense.  By then you’ve let the English speaking kids from DUMBO into the school and left the French speaking kids from Flatbush out.  Which is what happened and exactly what we didn’t want to happen.  Same for MS88.

i'm really uncomfortable with the shift in demographic this school has undergone in the past 3 years, but, after this 8th grade remote learning fiasco,  it's our son's best option for continuity and stability.  primarily because of this extremely overbearing focus on recruiting non-french speaking park slope and DUMBO kids, i feel my son is really not receiving the french language  instructions we expected, so we heavily compensate at home by playing a lot of french movies, speaking french in general conversation and spending time in francophone countries.  



i've also spent a lot of time during this remote learning year making sure my kid is prepared for the regents exams and psat's.  i've gotten a few notices about these tests, but i would expect a lot more involvement from the school.  i really feel like i need to either instruct my child on his own or pay for a kaplan or princeton review course.  if our kids' performance on these semi-useless tests is so important for funding, they need to be more proactive in offering after school tutoring or discount courses.",0,0,5,2020-07-07T01:12:41,0.75,0.048,0.201,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.057,0.259,0.032,0.22699999999999998,0.195,0.474,0.127
15K497,BHS Parent ,brooklyn,Middle,437,"I'm sure the school will do their best once kids are admitted, but the Diversity Plan couldn't be clearer on this point.   

From the plan:  Allow elementary students who have completed a dual language program to be automatically eligible for middle school dual language programs. Utilize a transparent & objective assessment to determine bi-literacy for new students entering a middle school dual language program.
From the directory (post-adoption of plan): Program Eligibility: Open to students and residents of Brooklyn who currently attend an elementary-level French Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Education program, or who have academic proficiency in both English and French.

It's frustrating that the DOE and the school won't acknowledge the issue or apologize to the families who were caught up in this this year.   But stakeholders who worked hard to get this into the plan - written in the plainest language possible - are hopeful it will be better implemented next year.  We are working to make that happen.  And we're working to make sure the next point is also executed (Encourage the citywide School Diversity Advisory Group to research & explore the impacts of Dual Language programs as they relate to school diversity & integration).  Spanish speaking kids should have access to MS 88's language program.  French speaking kids should have access to BHS's program.   This is why there ARE these two borough-wide programs in D15.   I hope BHS joins this effort.

I have a son who graduated from the high school program and another son who went through middle school and is currently in the high school program and a third who is also now in the middle school program. Throughout this time I have seen principal Lanzilotto and the BHIS  staff push for nothing but the best for our children on a daily basis.
My oldest thoroughly enjoyed the culinary program when he attended BHIS. The hands-on experience of actually cooking in a real working kitchen was so encouraging and helpful in developing character and self-esteem.  The enthusiasm and the encouragement he received from not only his teachers but all of the faculty throughout his years there was wonderful. With lots of college tours beginning in the 10th grade BHIS is focused on helping the kids well beyond high school. Teaching them skills that will help them be successful in their years to come at whatever University they choose to go to.
The children receive a well-rounded education. The IB program  it's not just solely based on what you can read in a book which can be really one-dimensional but they relate lessons and education to what is going on in the world today, Creating true Global Citizens.

The school takes great pride in the development of the children socially and academmically. The IB curriculum is always centered with current and age appropriate issues. It keeps the kids engaged and allows teaching in group discussions that culminates with a writing piece which are called summative. The school is very diverse and I love that my son is surrounded by friends with different ethnic background. Learning also happens with your friends and who they are, I love that BHS supports this. We are a french speaking family and my son can continue to learn the language and children with no knowledge in french entering 6th grade get the opportunity to learn the language as well, how great is that ! The administration and core of teachers are very dedicated and their to support you when problems arise, I have found that very telling of how a school functions when a student faces a problem.

When we went on the tour last spring, this was literally the only school out of the ten we visited where he visibly showed excitement.  The standout aspects of the school are the smart, talented and friendly staff and students, French immersion, the amazing school yard, and believe it or not, the full kitchen that is incorporated into the foreign language curriculum.  
       His (and our) instincts were spot on.  While the school in undergoing significant growth and expanding their rigorous Baccalaureate curriculum, the new principal, Nicole Lanzillotto, was the AP in charge of the middle school throughout the school’s transition to a Baccalaureate curriculum.  She knows the community, curriculum and her staff quite well and is managing the growth and transition quite adeptly.  The staff really impressed us at curriculum night with their ability to articulate their process, their enthusiasm, and their kindness.
        Our son has an IEP and is thriving in the project-based learning environment.  His IEP and Speech teachers are simply fantastic; in a recent check-in meeting with them, I was pleased that they clearly care about my son, know his strengths and challenges and were willing to modify his services to address some challenges—he is in great hands!

15K497,Monica R,brooklyn,Middle,437,"My daughter is in 6th grade and is just about to finish her first year at BHIS – Boerum Hill School for International Studies (formerly SIS). In the fall of 5th grade during middle school tours, BHIS was not even on my radar and I didn’t even list it as a choice.  Later, I heard some parents who had gone on tours mentioning how impressed they were, but by the time I wanted to go on a tour, they were finished.  Luckily, the school was trying to put together a dual language French program and by early Spring was able to confirm the program would be offered.  That meant the DLP program/school was listed on the new schools application form and we applied under that. So, we ended up being in the very lucky position to have actually had the choice between MS51 and BHIS.  MS51 is an excellent school
and I went back and forth trying to decide, but in the end I decided BHIS was a
better fit for my daughter. It took a great leap of faith because the program
is new, but now I am so glad I made that choice. My daughter has blossomed at
BHIS, academically, emotionally, and socially. Her confidence has soared.  What I love about the program is that students are encouraged to think critically, take risks, and ask questions. In the beginning I was worried whether she was getting enough content because it is a bit harder to gauge compared to a traditionally structured school. ELA and Social Studies are integrated, for example. 
However, I think she has received an education equal to the top middle
schools. Her twin brother is enrolled at Twain so I have been able to compare
them side by side throughout the year. In certain areas I think Twain went into
a little more depth but not by a whole lot. Twain is a well-oiled and smoothly
run school as it has many years under its belt. BHIS does have some growing
pains but this is to be expected.  The principal, Ms. Juman, is simply AMAZING! She is truly open to parent feedback and suggestions. Any time I have had a problem she has responded immediately and worked to fix it. The school accepts 6th graders who are both beginner and advanced French speakers. During French class they are separated according to ability. This is the only time they are separated.  In all other classes they are mixed which is great and helps build community.  Even during the extended day French classes (2:45-4:00) they are mixed and each student is expected to participate according to their ability. These classes include debate, choir, cooking, theatre, digital storytelling, and soccer. So, they are doing all these fun things but learning the corresponding French vocabulary as they go along. What I am really excited about is high school at BHIS. BHIS middle school students will have priority to attend the high school which will
be offering the rigorous and prestigious International Baccalaureate. IB
programs are strictly vetted by some international organization that oversees
these diplomas, and schools have to prove they meet these standards before
being approved as an IB school.  BHIS is very close to obtaining this approval.",1,0,0,2016-05-26T19:11:38,0.75,0.048,0.201,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.057,0.259,0.032,0.22699999999999998,0.195,0.474,0.127

15K839,Nico ,brooklyn,Middle,345,"I am currently an 8th grade student at this school. The pros: Ms839 has great academics, the teachers are all great, students can do dissections in as early as 7th grade. There is a lot of choice in the classes you take. The cleanliness of the building makes the school a pleasant place to learn. The advisory groups are fun and help kids make friends and feel like they have allies in the school that will support them. In 8th grade students are guided through the high school application process. There is a great sense of community at the school. Teachers are very supportive and will help you whenever you need as long as you are proactive. The cons: If your student wants to get great grades in 7th grade to impress prestigious high schools, the extra credit work and regular homework will be stressful, and in order to improve their grades the student will have to be very proactive. Very often strong opinions are mixed into topics like immigration during humanities classes; for example, my humanities teachers have at times given us obviously biased articles that clearly support open borders. While I don't necessarily disagree with the articles, I don't think they should be used educationally if they are argumentative. The last con is that the ""Morning meetings"" can at times feel like ""far left"" democratic meetings. Most of them talk about how we need to believe certain things. For example, there was once a teacher that said we should support native americans by putting signs on all buildings that said ""This is native land"".

15K839,Susanna,brooklyn,Middle,345,"I thought it was time, as a current 8th grade parent, to update my comments.
We are still thrilled about the school!  I feel like all the things I said two years ago are still true.  Interesting curriculum, diversity, super dedicated staff and teachers, responsiveness... Now I'm on my 2nd year as a member of the SLT (school leadership team).  It's been a great experience and I find that there is amazing respect for our input and working with Lauren (Shookoff, the AP) is an education in organization!  One of my interests has been working on incorporating teaching executive functioning, organization and time management skills into the curriculum.  The spirit was willing at the beginning but the structure was week.  We did a lot of work last year and my sense is that most of the work has seen fruition in the 6th grade.  I'm a bit frustrated not to have seen a big change for the 8th graders but I do understand that, since the school is new and there is so much planning for curriculum and projects, this is difficult to execute fully for those of us who 'pioneered'.  I hope we're leaving the school in a stronger place there.
My one other concern is this - the homework was really manageable in 6th grade, got more appropriately more involved in 7th grade, but is seaming a bit sparse in the 8th grade.  It's still meaningful; no BS work.  And they do have some double periods (including a study hall) where they can do some work, I just worry a bit that my son won't be prepared for the total over-work of high school.  Mind you, as someone who works with honors students in a college, high schoolers often have more volume of work than college students.
Anyway, those are the only concerns I have.  I still love the school, I love the administration, I love the teachers, I love hanging out with the other parents in our happy hours, and I'm going to be really sad leaving the school!!
Oh, and while my son is still very close with his elementary school friends, he has a nice, diverse bunch of friends from 839 too.

15K839,Susanna,brooklyn,Middle,345,"We feel like we've won the lottery with ms 839! Pun intended.

Curriculum:
The expeditionary, projects-based curriculum is so well integrated. No subject is left behind and that clearly helps to keep both the students and faculty and administrators excited and working as a team. As some have said, it doesn't look like the traditional kind of challenging but it is challenging and it encourages a kind of critical thinking that you won't find in many middle schools. Next unit: motion and forces (I may be putting that wrong) and they are building bicycles! Feel free to donate to the bike kit drive!
Teachers:
Wow. The teachers are so excited and smart and dedicated! The other day at the play I was sitting in front of them all at the play. They were howling with laughter and commenting with such appreciation at each of the kids on stage. You could tell that they had genuine relationships with them. We have emailed many of the teachers with questions and concerns and they are always thoughtful in their answers. The other day a grown up asked our son who was his favorite teacher and he couldn't answer. There are no bad eggs! Of course Lauren and Michael are extremely impressive and passionate about the school they are building.
As it is a new school there are going to be bumps and missteps along the way (nothing big) but the point is that Michael always asks for feedback and is genuine in his efforts to incorporate suggestions. The dedication to community building and responsibility is real.
Another part of their approach is using Restorative Justice model. One aspect of this community based approach to keeping things running smoothly and having students take responsibility for their actions is morning meeting (Quaker style) where they can celebrate someone for empathy, unity, perseverance, service or reflection. I was at one of them before a school trip and expected the students to be pretty silent. But they really bought in and what they had to say about each other actually made me cry. And they were clearly not just talking about their close friends. I think that this kind of getting to know and think about people at this crucial stage of development will last them a life time.
I agree with the comment below about the level of discipline being not what a 321 (or in my case 107) parent would be used to. It is a new challenge for my son.  But I also think that kids need to be able to adapt to different environments. And the many kids of diversity that 839 offers is nothing that you can find in rarified Park Slope.  The other challenge is PTA  fundraising... so if you can help with that, c'mon! You won't be sorry!

15K839,brooklyn_architect,brooklyn,Middle,345,"As a relatively uninvolved parent, I couldn’t be happier with MS 839.  Meaning, as someone who fails to participate in helping the school through PTA or any other kind of guidance, my spouse and I ride on the coattails of all the fine parents that do contribute their time.  And our child is not vocal, or excited enough about school, to immerse us in the daily curriculum.  So that being said, to qualify much of what I don’t know about the school academically, I can still endorse what you’ve seen here from other parents recently.  The “expedition”, inter-disciplinary approach seems to engage the students, and the ""crew"" advisory system works well.

The youth, intelligence and vitality of the faculty and administration is impressive.  The small size of the school is crucial, and the building is fantastic.  The facilities really reflect the people involved to create an impression of a very advanced, modern program.  The faculty are responsive to individual inquiries and requests.  And yet it’s all done in what feels like a one-room-schoolhouse environment.

It is not a conventionally challenging school such as MS 51.  I don’t believe that a parent or student interested in a competitive, high-achievement environment will find this school appealing.  It is much more nurturing than that.  The discipline needs of many students may make for a society not as well-behaved as a PS 321 parent would be used to, also.

15K839,Kim Purcell,brooklyn,Middle,345,"Our daughter is currently in the inaugural class of MS 839, grade 6, entering grade 7 in the fall. She loves the school and so do we! The school is very inclusive and diverse, and most importantly, and probably because of the diversity, it's a kind school. The kids do many projects together, so this probably helps with the feeling of acceptance in the school community. Our daughter is a pretty sensitive kid and feels that her needs are being considered and that she's valued and respected as an individual. Unlike so many schools, it's not a stressful environment. This is pretty key for learning. You just have to stand in the courtyard as kids are let out to see the difference. 

The kids feel very comfortable with the principal who has an open-door policy, and they seem to really like the teachers too. I never hear about the ""bad"" teacher because there aren't any. If kids have issues with one another, they go in for mediation to learn how to make things right. The social-emotional needs are definitely met for these kids and that's the toughest part. 

Academically, I'd say science, ELA and theater are very strong, and math is a little weaker, only because it seems that a lot of kids need extra help. However, they can get free out-of-school help twice a week, or more, if needed. All the teachers really bend over backwards to make sure the kids succeed. They just put on one of the funniest, most polished student plays I've ever seen, and they are about to publish children's books about the Gowanus Canal, incorporating what they learned in science about the canal  and storytelling in ELA. They do a lot of cross-over in subjects to bring meaning and context to what they are learning. It's very impressive.

15K839,MikeTRose,brooklyn,Middle,345,"Hi Ray, I'm the parent of an MS 839 6th grader. For our daughter and our family, 839 has been a spectacular experience this year. The degree of personal attention from classroom and crew teachers, the immersive and field-based learning programs, the beautiful facility, and the emerging extracurricular/Afterschool lineup have all come together to create a warm, accessible and friendly school that feels like it's been a part of the community for years. (Even the PTA meetings are fun! And so are the parent/staff happy hours.)

Our daughter enjoys every subject, and she was thrilled to participate in the spring play just this week. She's active in the peer mediation club and enjoys good relationships with all of her (young, energetic, innovative) teachers. And the whole family benefits from the rationalized 9 am start time.

It will be interesting to see how the school evolves with an expanded staff and a class  of 7th graders (and eventually 8th graders). Academic depth and homework amounts may increase for the upper classes. And the appropriate resources and support from DOE will be critical to sustain the high quality of the program so far. Nevertheless, I have a lot of confidence in Michael Perlberg and his hand-picked staff to adapt, expand and improve MS 839 in the years ahead.

15K839,Rob Millis,brooklyn,Middle,345,"MS 839 is exceptional in every regard. Principal Michael Perlberg and Assistant Principal Lauren Shookhoff have recruited and lead an incredible team of teachers and administrators. Collectively, they have seized the opportunity to create a progressive school that engages, supports, and motivates students more effectively than any of the middle schools we considered.

As a new school with generally younger teachers, MS 839 is run by people eager to create a school that excels, without carrying the legacy baggage that comes with many older schools. Anyone who has witnessed the yelling, outdated thinking, and sheer exhaustion of teachers and staff at some other schools will appreciate the optimistic, engaged, and entirely dedicated educators at MS 839. 

Teachers and administrators apply the best, most current methods of teaching and management to give each student the greatest advantage possible, both in and outside of the classrooms.

Theater, arts, and physical education are highly valued at MS 839, and a truly interdisciplinary approach to education enhances connections between arts and sciences. 

By starting the school day later than other schools, at 9:00, students are also more likely to be focused and engaged at the start of each day. The one big drawback to a later school day is that afternoon schedules can be more challenging, especially because many programs depend on all schools letting out earlier.

With a greater budget for facilities and services, MS 839 would compete well with many private schools. Considering all of the academic, social, and personal factors, I prefer MS 839 over any of the nearby private schools for our child.

It's a shame that parents throughout Brooklyn have to choose between either great or awful schools, with very little in between. And of course several never even look at your application if it is chosen as #2.

Those schools, in turn, are so overwhelmed with applications that they will only look at kids who rank them top of the list. My son was quite interested in 839 but we both thought it was foolish to waste a #1 or #2 spot on a school that enters everyone in a blind lottery. The odds of not getting in could be high, leaving him with no spot there and one less opportunity to go for a selective school. Every one of his friends made the same choice. The net result, I think, is that 839 will not get as many kids who perform above grade level.

From my first interaction with the school, I found the teachers and administrators to be welcoming and supportive. Upper grade students have access to technology, college prep and STEM courses. Students are groomed to develop confidence in their leadership skills by being nominated to serve as school representatives or leading a class activity with their peers. As a parent, I appreciated the open door policy and felt that my input as a parent was valued. I also participated in the free parent leadership workshops that were led by Dr. Angela Moses on Saturday mornings. Since graduating from 5th grade last year, my son and his friends remain in contact with their PS 5 teachers and coaches due to the strong bond they have built. PS 5 was a wonderful learning environment for my son both socially and academically. Downside: they have a small shared gym/cafeteria that can be partitioned

16K005,valerie Mayo,brooklyn,Elementary,164,"P.S. 5 — The Ronald E. McNair School

P.S. 5 is a tiny elementary school with a big heart located in the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn.

Principal Lena Gates entered PIX11's Fuel My School competition because she says her students ""need the fuel to continue their golden rule,"" which is treating one another with kindness.  As a Title 1 school, P.S. 5 has a high population of low-income families. Many of those families have been homeless at some point. Gates explained in her submission that some of the possible fuel money would go toward supporting

The in-house bookstore which is staffed by students, has a difficult time supplying all of the necessary books. Some of the items are donated, but many are purchased directly by the school staff.

""Our children need to read and the more they read their worlds open up, we want to make sure that they have the opportunity to have books in their hands,"" said Principal Lena.

Their mission of helping others is exactly what sets them apart. Children at P.S. 5 as young as 10-years-old are already entrepreneurs. The students dreamt up the idea of 'The Shower Bus' — a traveling, mobile unit that would allow the local homeless population to take showers and receive clean clothing. Students are even working with Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams to make the concept a reality this June.",0,0,0,2019-05-07T20:02:24,0.75,0.049,0.433,0.22,0.532,0.366,0.8109999999999999,0.0,0.835,0.134,0.03,0.49200000000000005

16K005,Ferdi Alexander,brooklyn,Elementary,164,"I Disagree with any of the given points from this website,
At the time of writing this I have graduated from this school and it was amazing, From Kindergarten to 2nd grade you get to experience how to multiply add subtract, they take you on numerous trips so the fun never ends and they also teach you how to swim. From 2nd grade to 4th grade you have to toughen up a little because of the exams and you have to be ready to take in any information because it will count in the long run. Teachers do encourage students to also study online. This school also has a very nice yard where there is a jungle gym, football field and basketball court and if you don't want to even be outside you can stay inside in the auditorium with a lovely nice person named Ms. Graham and you can watch TV inside for the time being. There is a technology room where students learn how to code through a series of classes day by day. By the end you will feel accomplished with some of the things you have done. By the time you have reached into the 5th grade there is a teacher named Ms. Van. This teacher is top notch i must say, she helps you with whatever you need and works as hard as possible for you accumulate knowledge as you go forward. She strives for you and your classmates to have a great Learning experience. During 4th and 5th grade you will have test prep/ tutors available to you after school. These tutors help you to get 3s and 4s on the state exams. The school also has a dance program where students learn how to dance and do Choreography and when the time is right the school will host a dance play for other students and staff to come and watch. The senior trip is Absolutely amazing. Not gonna spoil though.
   I do think the school should improve on the food they serve (Tastes like plastic) and they should host more fundraisers, Could come in handy.",0,0,0,2019-02-17T03:06:56,0.75,0.049,0.433,0.22,0.532,0.366,0.8109999999999999,0.0,0.835,0.134,0.03,0.49200000000000005
16K005,Benoit Busseuil,brooklyn,Elementary,164,"I am the father of a pre-K student at PS5. During this year at PS5, my daughter experienced a lot of things. First I should say she is always happy to go to school. It is a very friendly and family environment, and I feel good that my child thrives in it.
Then in terms of curriculum, I can't complain. I usually read stories to my daughter in french, which is my native language. I recently read her a story in english, and she stopped me. She said, I'm going to read it. She did, and belive me I checked that this book was unknown to her before!
Other things in elementary schools I think are very important, and this school does very well, is being confident. An example I can give is I got a phone call from the gym teacher (they have gym everyday at PS5): she tells me, do you want to see your child run the warm up session tomorrow?
Of course I said yes, we went with my wife, and we saw our little girl directing her classmates how to shake their legs, and jump in the air... The teacher rotates who does this, and I think it is a great soft skills learning lesson.
This year is not over yet, but we had at least two field trips per month, all free, welcoming parents to chaperon. I have been happilly surprised that many parents are participating to these trips, making a nice community feeling.
Answering to the review of the school by this website, I don't think it gives a true feeling of what the school does offer for us families and for our children.
I think the leadership is well aware of some weaknesses of the school, and nobody is perfect. But I can see this school on a well upward trend. 
A dual language program is being launched for september 2018. My feeling is that it will help the school mingle current students with some other stuents part of the gentrification wave that the area experiences.
I am a strong supported of this program, and I will try to make sure that everyone benefits from it. 
Last think I want to say is regarding the review quoting shelter students accounting for bad stats for attendance. True or not, I would say that you can't tell from any student who is in a shelter or not. And truly, that is not our business.
This school is a public school, who warmly welcomes childrens, whatever their social background, cultural background or color is. So for this too, I think this school rocks.
Next year my daughter will be attending the school, in the french dual language program. I am convinced that she will learn, but she will also brings to the school.

16K005,I'M JUST SAYING ,brooklyn,Elementary,164,"I recently read the article posted by Inside Schools. I am disappointed that they had to search for something negative to say about this school. Students economical background does not define a school especially when a pre-schooler was named the grade and district winner of this year science competition. Nor does it show that their fourth graders attended the first ever cross curricular STEM program at Medgar Evers College a true college career pipeline. Secondly,1/3 of the teachers on a survey does not account for the 2/3 of teachers that work hard EVERYDAY to made sure that EVERY student receives the educations they deserve. The principal does a great job in developing systems to help students and staff maximize their effort to work together as one.  
        Lastly, this school is not perfect and children who have a difficult time adjusting have a guidance counselor they can see when needed. There are also classroom routines and parent communication that are used to help students who are struggle with behavior. However, the school is far from students ever being out of control or mayhem. Maybe Inside School should of asked instead of looking up that information. Also please keep in mind that like this post their article and the survey is based on someone opinion.

This school isn’t good for any child that wants to learn even if the child can’t read they still push them to the next grade🤦🏽‍♀️ My son was in a class where only 3 to 4 kids could read and the whole class moved to the next grade and didn’t know how to read. There is never no funds for the students After school activities which I heard in the PTA that the principal steals the funds. This school is full of drama not learning or teaching. If u have a kid goin to the 2nd grade this sept be very careful cause it’s one parent that thinks she runs the school and they allow her too. Choose another school it will be better for u and your child education. Check out some charter schools.

Ms. Douglas is an impressively dedicated principal, and knows each and every one of them. Ms. Williams, the parent coordinator, makes every effort to keep parents well-informed of school events and activities, and the assistant principal, Ms. Johnson (lovingly referred to as Ms. A.P) works very hard to help students and parents give their best. It is a shame that this school does not receive more recognition for their steadfast and unwavering support of their students.

In a district of almost forgotten children, Ron Brown Academy stands out as a safe, involved, caring and supportive community for students and parents alike. :)

Ms Donna is lovely and explained how she encourages the kids to explore telling stories through pictures as a path to early writing (love this approach). Everyone was so motivated and organized. I also attended their community garden party where parents and community leaders came together to brainstorm ideas for the school and the year end art expo. Both events were exceptional. It's only the beginning for my child at the school but so far he loves it and the teachers have been very supportive and kind. It's truly a community school: Where the principle is there to greet parents in the morning and the vice principle is there checking students out at the end of the day. I also love the art program--where kids keep their own sketchbooks and explore art history. All the teachers seem to really go above and beyond. I see limitless success for 335!

The HW isn’t always an hour and a half - it depends on the teacher and my daughter has only been required to read 15minutes a day (she’s been in the school since pre-k and is going to 2nd grade next year). She is reading at nearly 3rd grade levels (2-years above) as a result. She learns so many amazing things in music and art and I believe she is becoming quite well-rounded which is what I want most for her. I want her to find her niche and her love and I think there’s room for her to do that here - and still be a great overall student. I’d highly recommend it. Her teachers have been highly involved and responsive. And my daughter is always anxious to do her best to please them. I like that. Small class size also means a lot to me. No school is perfect and i know that the school is working with a much tighter budget because the income levels in the neighborhood have risen so they get less government support. Parents must stay involved and support fundraisers to keep the school strong. I’m hoping more of the bumps will get worked out as the new principal finds his legs but he’s a great guy and very hands-on so I’m sure it will happen.",0,0,0,2019-07-10T14:57:04,1.0,0.012,0.22699999999999998,0.0,0.086,0.08,0.462,0.02,0.725,0.127,0.096,0.175
16K628,irmalighthouse,brooklyn,Elementary,251,"I have two kids in this school.  I really like Ms. Haskins, and have nothing but positive experiences with the teachers who are all deeply dedicated educators.  The limitation: I am very much against homework, particularly at this age, and there's a bounty of research now indicating it's not productive.  In fact the National Parent Teacher Association recommends no or nominal homework prior to first grade and then 10 min. of homework for each grade level so 10 min. for first graders, 20 for second etc.  Last year we found ourselves doing 2 hours or more of homework each night with our first grader and quickly grew disillusioned.  When I objected to the volume of homework Ms. Haskins and my child's teacher both took the time to meet with me and work out a fair compromise.  I think my only issue with this school is their obsession with performing on the annual standardized tests.  I feel like everything is geared toward the very narrow goal of achievement on the narrow range of topics on a handful of tests generated by politicians, bureaucrats and consultants, not educators.  The effect in my opinion is an overly narrow curriculum focused strictly on the topics tested and not a well rounded education.  I think the kids would be better served by a school where the educators are more willing to question the current system and put education above rankings but that's probably a bit much to ask of BedStuy during the current era.

16K628,Anna Shenk,brooklyn,Elementary,251,"Brooklyn Brownstone is an extraordinary school, the elusive
“diamond in the rough.” When looking for a school for our children, we visited nearly a dozen schools in Crown Heights and
Bedford-Stuyvesant and none compared to what we saw at Brooklyn Brownstone. The key here is that the school is small and therefore a community. Not only do administrators and teachers know all the students by name, children across all grade levels know one another and support one another. Another distinctive is the school’s commitment not only to academic excellence but to character
development. Students learn early to behave respectfully and responsibly. In addition, the school has stellar art and music programs that include regular showcases were students can express themselves artistically and build confidence in their public speaking and performance skills. Academically, I have seen teachers do the impossible – helping students who were struggling thrive while helping academically advanced students grow as well. Parent
involvement here is significantly higher than other local schools as well and parent involvement is not only welcomed but expected. It cannot be easy to build and sustain a thriving New York
  City school but Brownstone’s administrators and teachers
have done it. Where else in Brooklyn will you find a teacher who will attend a student’s birthday party or baseball game on a
Saturday afternoon? That’s the kind of family you will find at Brooklyn

Pre-K was a dream and Kindergarten was a complete nightmare and please, don't let elaborate on the horrific principal.  When a professional administrator can tell you ""if you don't like it here, send your child to a different school..."" as a resolution to the issues that you address, find the nearest rock and let that rock teach your child instead of this school.   At first, I thought it was just my attitude so I asked my husband to talk to her since he worked for the Education dept. but even he didn't get any results.  Then I met a group of parents...angry, bitter and fed up parents and I realized how far from alone that I was in this battle.  In this year, I let myself get talked me into getting my child evaluated and when the Bd. of Ed. said there was NOTHING wrong with him, the teacher AND principal walked out.  After that, every little thing that my child did was wrong including being excluded from trips unless I attended every single last one of them.  I gave up and decided to keep him home every time and taught him on my own.  A month later, I pulled him out of the afterschool program because it was hinted to me that my child was labeled once he got there.  I even took it a step further at times:  watched from my window to see the behavior of the kids on school trips on my days off, talked to other parents (specifically people in my son's class), received feedback from other staff members and at the end of the school year, I came to the conclusion that the teacher that I gave such a hard way to go wasn't the complete problem..They're looking for donations every time I turn around for everything from the copy paper, tissue...you name it.  Technology is a joke because you have to wish upon a star that it works.  One of the grades had THREE substitute teachers in one school year and then wondered why most of the kids were promotion in doubt.  If you 're not part of the PTA, good luck to your child.  If he/she is not one of her ""favorites"", then forget it.  I really thought highly when I enrolled him in school but somewhere along the lines this year, something went completely wrong.   I encourage you to talk to so many parents and if you're lucky, to some teachers who will be honest (there's a few) and then maybe you'll get a better idea of this school.

Ms. Malcolm has always maintained a sense of transparency with us parents. Whenever we are in the building we are always aware of what she is doing. Ms. Malcolm has ALWAYS had our children’s best interest at heart. Her open door policy allows us to visit the school, volunteer throughout the day, and allow us to sit in our child’s class. I’ve spoken with a majority of the parents and we are all extremely happy with Principal Malcolm’s work ethics and vision for our scholars and this school. Let’s us as a parent community come together and volunteer and help out during the day, instead of tearing down the administration. So few parents are involved in volunteer service! As a parent I completely understand we have jobs and have to support our children but, in order to maintain the success of our child we must be the driving force of the schools success. The staff has always been supportive and helpful to us parents and our students. I hope to see more of us parents lending a hand and helping in the success and growth of our child’s school.

However, under the new ""leadership"" of Principal Anne Marie Malcolm the quality of the school has diminished significantly. Ms. Malcolm is rarely ever present in the building and spends her time prepping for photo opportunities instead of investing in the professional development of teachers and building relationships with students to assess their needs. The staff consists primarily of first-year teachers who are still learning the profession. The secretary is wildly unprofessional and every time I have ever visited or called the school building she is eating, laughing, talking loudly or being generally inappropriate. I regret sending my child to this school and will be transferring my son out before the school gets closed down for poor leadership and under enrollment.

Further more I DO NOT believe that children wrote these malicious comments about this school, its hard working teachers (WHO DON'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT !) and the principal, Ms. Sandra Taylor (who I hear was selected by the Superintendant and former principal Ronda Taylor ). Ms. Sandra Taylor increased the gifted academy so that more children could benefit. But If you ARE children,don't worry about Ms. Mormon or any other teacher, make sure you LEARN ALL the things they have to teach you; there are VERY few GREAT teachers left like them, teachers who DON'T run out at 3:00 pm. By the way look up the word ""ghetto"" it does NOT apply to people of color.",7,0,0,2011-08-20T13:00:06,0.75,0.045,0.187,0.045,0.131,0.151,0.682,0.024,0.8540000000000001,0.106,0.006,0.35100000000000003

P.S. 91
does not deserve a rate of even one star. I did a walk through on more than one
occasion and the quality of the school has been run through the ground. The
principal is by far the worse principal I have ever dealt with in all my years
in the educational system. The previous principal was the best I have ever seen
in this district. He was for his students, teachers and his parents. This
principal is only for herself. The students are the worse I have seen in years.
I cannot believe the drastic change that has happened with in this school. In
previous years, I have spoken to many of the students, and staff at P.S. 91,
and they expressed to me that this school felt like a second home for them. Some
of those same people I recently spoke with said it is more like hell. I how can
a person run a school, sorry a jail, in such a way. The principal and her crew
should be removed so that our children have a better chance of receiving the
best education not only through books but through interaction with teachers and
staff who love what they are doing. A better environment makes a child want to
learn and take part in their education.

Respect is earned & from what I have seen upon my trips to this school, they should be disposed of. Barking at children is not the way to do it.  Also the paint on the walls is very thick and falling off. At times no toilet paper is provided for the children. Physical education is not offered enough at PS 91. One day a week, and then that is not even promised. Another problem I think, how can they be making the children go to the bathroom at the same time? I thought it was an educational facility not a farm. These State Test they have been readying students for has been very stressful on the children. Pressured into longer school hours, even taking up their Easter break. Almost on a daily basses my child has been having head aches. Is there any body out there that truly cares about our children.

But after a while I didn't see Ms. Jenkins anymore and heard she had pass away. I was very sad, she always had a nice/encouraging word to say to you and little young people need that so much today. Thanks to all my teachers from back in the day and to all the teachers today, you help shape the community one child at a time every time you step into a students 
After graduating I went to Roy H. Mann JHS, and Clara Barton HS. Later I relocated out the state, finished college and have been working as a visiting nurse with the elderly and hospice patients for close to 30 years.

17K221,Nancie Seedsinthemiddle,brooklyn,Elementary,246,"Heads up! PS 221 is Seeds in the Middle's pilot Hip2B Healthy School. We are proud to brag that in spring 2012, 87% of our focus 4th grade class - Ms. Fearon's class - scored at or ABOVE grade level on math (27% scored ""4s"". In literacy, 69% scored at or above grade level and check this out! 96.2% scored at or above grade level in science!  

Those students ran our Seeds in the Middle Hip2B Healthy Market, grew edible gardens, composted, cooked healthy with professional chefs, played soccer or ran or enjoyed other physical fitness, engaged in the arts - like singing with the Metropolitan Opera Guild! They went to Manhattan to shop at Whole Foods for their healthy market, attend a dress rehearsal at the Metropolitan Opera, were guest workshop leaders at the Brooklyn Food Coalition Food Conference, presented their market as a model healthy FUNDRAISER at the Department of Education and Health's School Healthy Fundraiser Expo. They helped run the Crown Heights Farmers Market, worked with Farmer Rodrick Brown to grow in an indoor Green Room, toured their neighborhood to highlight food disparities between Crown Heights and wealthier nabes, attended a lecture by SUNY Downstate Cardiology Club on the link between diet and exercise and heart disease and diabetes. These students led ""No Sugary Drink Week"" at PS 221 after Mayor Bloomberg cracked down on sugary drinks, making fresh lemonade and limeade and comparing sugar content between their beverage and soda. Then they taught other students to make it and its benefits! 

Most of the classrooms, from prek to grade 5 at PS 221 are Hip2B Healthy Classrooms, where students create rules: ""No junk food here."" ""We run.""

Students at PS 221 grow edible gardens, run a Hip2B Healthy Market selling healthy snacks for 50 cents or less, cook nutritiously with professional chefs (Buddakan), play soccer, run and get fit, engage in the arts: every child studies music with either the Metropolitan Opera Guild or keyboard with Music in the Brain curriculum. Our students have cooked with the Yale Club chef, visited the Met Opera, conducted book readings at Book Court, Cobble Hill or Barnes and Noble, Park Slope. 

They are ambassadors of change. At PS 221 - a neighborhood with one of the highest rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, asthma in the city - where many children only have one parent at home, or come from other countries  - we are saying, Yes, we Can!

We are a model for other schools! Our dedicated, talented teachers can tell you how they are raising achievement by integrating gardening, composting, healthy cooking, market math, food justice and literacy, arts, fitness. They face many challenges with families fighting tremendous obstacles many wealthier Americans know nothing about.

PS 222 got an ""A"" in spring 2011 after Seeds in the Middle began its pilot. But by fall 2011, Principal Kirkland lost 11 teachers - some of her best - due to budget cuts, forcing her science teacher to go back into the classroom as a partner in a CTT classroom. Class sizes were doubled. Last spring, the DOE quality review team gave this veteran principal, who grew up in the neighborhood, a devastating ""D."" 

No one looked at how a key model class of Seeds in the Middle had tes scores rivaling any top-rate public school in a much wealthier neighborhood. By the way, nearly 100 percent of PS 221 students get free and reduced lunch and are minorities. 

Their promise is why Seeds in the Middle chose this school in the obesity epidemic in central Brooklyn as its pilot in 2010. We knew that our model at PS 91, discontinued after partner Principal Solomon Long retired, rocked!

PS 221 students have the option to arrive at 7 am three days a week to walk/run with volunteer teachers, led by Barbara Zam, plus outside running volunteers. Sometimes, they get certified soccer coaches or flag football coaches at recess. They buy and sell fresh, healthy snacks for 50 cents at their own Friday morning and Tuesday afternoon Hip2B Healthy Market. Thank you to generous donors like Whole Foods Market, Santa Cruz Organics, Justin's Nut Butter.... and now offers from Peeled Snacks!

Our students help found and run the Crown Heights Farmers Market, opened in 2011 to address the lack of farm fresh produce in their neighborhood. Thank you, co-founding farmers Jamerican Farmer Rodrick Brown and RH Farms, Roy Hildebrant, who died in August. Both farmers donated and mentored students. Rodrick still does! Roy's spirit lives among us, and his wife and six children are dedicated to our PS 221 and Crown Heights community. All share the wonder and joy of growing and mentor the children. Home Depot built indoor planting tables, where last spring, students grew seedlings for a joyous Mother's Day plant sale. They made $85!

SUNY medical students, university students, athletes, chefs, educators, NYU, Yale Club, builders, Home Depot, Whole Foods, and a multitude of generous volunteers dedicated to equity in education step in to support these underserved children at the request of Seeds in the Middle. We are creating a model for replication - successful because these students and teachers shine!

Parents - if you are in this neighborhood and you haven't heard - this is a gem. Check out this school. This is the truth. Get in the game with PS 221 - let your children lead the way to a healthy, joyous life full of opportunity.

17K221,guest_appearance_1,brooklyn,Elementary,246,"I am currently a parent of a 7 year old general education student and a 4 year old special needs child who will be attending kindergarten in September (2013) and will confidently say, no matter how good this school grades are, no matter how close I live to the school (school is directly ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME), I WILL NOT BE SENDING EITHER ONE OF MY CHILDREN THERE. They allow children to go out in sub-degree weather (under 32 degrees) to play, most of these children come out without hat, gloves, or coats. I have 3 friends who have children in that school and when I viewed this, I called the main office to ask what the cut-off temperature for banning the children to go outside. The woman on the phone responded, ""Do you have a child in the school?"" I answered no but I do have friends that have children there. She responded, ""Well, that's none of your business."" Then she hung the phone up. Now when these children go home, become sick and are out of school, the same school will start calling your home, calling ACS on parents, creating all kinds of unnecessary havoc. These parents now are forced to stay home, miss work (some of whom are not paid for sick days, unfortunately) and try their best to keep themselves and others from getting sick.

I also went to the school just to view their hallways and classrooms...let me just say that the ""frontline"" (adults that you meet upon entry) are more than condescending and rude. Additionally, some children directly disrespect staff and the staff return the favor and respond (not by using profanity but they might as well since what they say can easily be translated). As we know the children may have their individual issues, however, adults should NOT be TIT FOR TAT...that is just plain ridiculous.

This is my zone school and I will NOT be sending my children to the Twilight Zone. For those of you former students who made it out, kudos to you.

In addition, they are a pilot school for the Seeds in the Middle's Hip2B Healthy Project. Children are growing gardens and run a market selling healthy snacks. Chefs come to the school to teach cooking with kids, and also conduct demos in the school kitchen in the evenings for families, who all sit together and dine and then take home ingredients and recipes to repeat at home. We've also added the first ever youth soccer program and Zumba for adults - welcoming in students and adults from the entire community. The arts and the Hip2B Healthy projects excite students and teachers, and have boosted the students' academic skills in math, science, literacy and social studies as the teachers integrate lessons into the curriculum. P.S. 221 is an exciting, positive, nurturing place to learn for every child. Soccer and the chef's nights are beginning to lure more parent involvement.

The homework level is reasonable (less than 20 minutes per day) and lets me see what he's doing in class.  There are field trips approximately every other month (unfortunately this year's pumpkin patch trip was delayed by Hurricane Sandy but the kids did not seem to mind bringing home their pumpkins a few weeks after Halloween).

My daugther's teacher never sent home one single quiz nor test results for entire semester. When I asked the teacher why aren't you testing them on their spelling words on weekly basis . I was told the student was not ready. Another month goes by and I approach the teacher again and she mentioned we will start testing them soon. While at this point it's late  October time frame. Shortly afterbthe  progress reports came out and of course when I sat down to review my daughter's progress I was not pleased. I asked her how are you evaluate My Childs proformance since I have seen any quiz/test results. Then, she stated while we are testing your child but can not share the test with you. I'm never heard of anythin like this before in my life.  I'm asking to see my child test not some else . So, I states I need to understand what youbr testing her on so that I can work with her on specfic areas. The teacher than proceeds to hand hold the test and showed me the ones my child got wrong. At this point, I'm frastrsture and disappointed because  as I read on this site and others how great the school and super science Friday activities. Let me tell you something, my child never had a super science Friday activity nor did the other children that she meant in other classrooms during her 4 months there. Also, This school over loads them with home ...including the holidays. One last point I want to mentioned is there is 29 kids per class which is fairly large. Given the fact that there is only 1 teacher per classroom( the helper is optional), which is overwhelming for kids to learn in over crowed environment especially if your child is struggling.  Finally, I pulled my daughter out this school and placed her back into Get Set school. She is excelling and getting the proper amount of attention in the 
areas that need improvement .

17K289,5th grade mom,brooklyn,Elementary,327,"After many years of inefficiency, Mr. Jeffers was removed as principal. He was replaced by Ms. Harris-Frederick, who terrorized both the staff and the students. She was only there for one year and was then replaced by Ms. Mardy. 
Ms. Mardy was very pleasant and brought on many welcomed changes and new programs. I was excited to have my daughter finish her last few years at PS 289. However, my excitement has turned into disappointment and frustration. There are several out of control students that are allowed to get away with things. Their bad behavior is rewarded, while other students are ignored. 
I had an issue an was directed to speak with the Parent Coordinator, Ms. Tyrell. She was completely useless and behaved as if I was bothering her. I was actually surprised that she was employed by tge school because I used to see her standing by the exit after school. I thought that she was a grand parent because she did not behave like a school employee at dismissal. 
The guidance counselor, Ms Danny, is also useless. She did not offer assistance to parents with the middle school process and was very condescending when I asked about the that weren't on the District 17 application. 
I also don’t understand how the city has two elderly women as the school agents. One agent is very rude and always on her phone and the other appears to be confused all the time. 
Ms. Mardy's attitude has also changed. She used to stand outside after school and was very welcoming. The assistant principal is completely unreachable, the parent coordinator and guidance counselor are useless and now Ms. Mardy shuns parents. 
My daughter's teachers have been okay. The third and fourth grade teachers were excellent. My only issue with her current teacher is the management of a few wild students. 
Yes, the computer programs, steel pan and other activities are great. However, the staff members need great improvement.",0,0,0,2019-03-19T12:35:55,0.75,0.10400000000000001,0.275,0.052000000000000005,0.36700000000000005,0.226,0.777,0.057999999999999996,0.713,0.156,0.037000000000000005,0.49
17K289,Fifth grade mom again,brooklyn,Elementary,327,"A follow up to my above review. 
First, the positives. Ms. Mardy is now back standing outside at dismissal. I've seen her talking to parents again, but it doesn't appear genuine. The school also had intense test prep and my child felt very confident taking the state exams. Also, any time that I call the school I am greeted very well and the conversations are very pleasant. There are about five or six different voices that answer the phone. I wish those pleasantries extended to the front door and the administration. 
Now, on to my continued frustration. Many fifth grade parents are very upset. We were charged $130 for senior dues and our children were told that there isn't a prom and the senior trip is going to be a picnic in Staten Island. The school has also been hustling our children every day for money with sales at lunch. What are  they doing with our money? It is almost impossible to reach the assistant principal to find out what is going on. 
A parent informed us that she came up to the school to get some information. As she walked through the door, she saw a gray hair lady dragging and screaming at a student while the school safety sat there running her mouth. When the woman was shown to other parents, we were appalled to find out that the school had hired a known scammer from the neighborhood. She is also one of the people in charge of the sales at lunch. Now we see where our money is going. I don't want my child involved in these lame ""senior"" activities, but I don't want her to feel left out. This school will not be getting another penny from my household! 
I was relieved when I found out that Ms. Danny wasn't there any more. However, she has returned and the school now has two guidance counselors. There are barely 300 students. Why are there two counselors? It's not like they are controlling the students' behavior. 
Years ago, things were so different. The class sizes were much bigger but the teachers and administrators maintained order. I don't know why Mr. Jeffers isn't there any more, but I don't recall the community speaking so ill of the school. Parents are concerned about the lead in the water again as well. 
I am now fearful that the same out of control students will be attending the same middle school as my child. 
I hope that the parents can get together and have the assistant principal, the guidance counselors, the parent coordinator and the school safety removed. The parents association was always bragging about how great the staff and Ms. Mardy were and fooled the rest of the  parents. Overall, this school is a 3/10 at best, with only the test prep and computer programs propping up that score.",0,0,1,2019-05-10T12:28:29,0.75,0.10400000000000001,0.275,0.052000000000000005,0.36700000000000005,0.226,0.777,0.057999999999999996,0.713,0.156,0.037000000000000005,0.49

There are so many positives about this school beyond the fact it just received an ""A"" rating and keeps getting better each year. His Pre-K teachers are fantastic (energetic, happy and my son is learning a lot).  He's excited to go to school everyday! This year marks the first year there is a G&T Kindergarten program at the school. Each year those kids move up a grade, a new G&T class will be created per grade.There is a huge focus on music, the arts and science with dedicated teachers for each at every grade level. The student body is diverse at the lower grades and enrollment is increasing each year (think it's at 309 now). PS 316 is a true neighborhood & community school. Several of the other Pre-K parents attended PS 316 themselves! The PTA meets every month and is active. There are lots of after school activities for the older kids: drama club, science club, basketball, soccer, crocheting, etc. Oh, I almost forgot, there are additional music programs for the children: violin, cello and drumming. There are 15 slots filled by lottery for beginning violin at the Pre-K/K level each fall. My son takes free violin lessons for an hour after school twice a week!  Free. We paid for the violin.

17K340,D. Andre,brooklyn,Middle,204,"I was attended this school when it was only known as PS 340 when I was in the 4th grade up until I transferred in the 8th grade. This school is extremely small--very closed in, the teachers were hard on us, and the faculty showed favoritism! 

On the up side, the teachers were difficult in order to motivate us to do better... Nowadays that's hard to find because they only care about getting paid. I was a skyhawks cheerleader for the school and I had a wonderful time with them! We had talent shows every year, and when it would rain outside, we sometimes went upstairs in the auditorium and put on a little show for the other students. We always had science projects, and our art teacher would always teach us new techniques for drawing. The only real downside is the size... when I went out into the real world, I did have some anxiety because of the large crowds. The school is so intimitate, but it can be a problem when you go to a large high school.

As far as the fights is concerned, I probably got into a fight once a year and never got suspended. Just had my mom come up. In the sixth grade (when it became the North Star Academy) I started getting detention pretty often! I didn't have a behavior problem [maybe a slight temper]; this was because I never came with the full uniform. I never dressed down though. If my uniform was dirty, i would come in with a white button down and black slacks--one day i got caught by Ms. Eli (former principle) and she gave me detention and she was on top of me like white on rice. AND they give you detention if you are late to school!

Overall, I love this school! I would send my kids there too! Their education curriculum is awesome. When I transferred out :-(, my mom put me in MS 320 (I hated that school)! I was at the top of my class and I was damn proud of it! When I got there they were learning stuff I learned in the 6th grade--CATCH UP! But I totally recommend this school. Think of it as a free private school! I know I did.

In the picture, i'm the one sitting & not in full uniform.",6,0,0,2011-04-16T09:13:54,0.75,0.025,0.21600000000000003,0.028999999999999998,0.295,0.16699999999999998,0.647,0.005,0.74,0.191,0.015,0.244

The cons: some disruptive students, some teachers have trouble controlling a class, students often get away with misbehaving, hardly anyone wears the uniform, teachers often get off topic, dirty staircases and hallways (erasmus campus in general)

the pros: Very productive math class (ms.lewis,mr.dugue and mr walters), This is the first school that actually made me enjoy math which i sucked at. very strong and challenging gym class (miss ackbar, and especially mr anderson), They push you physically and help you get stronger. very easy school if you know your stuff, lunch is very lively and music is played, administration will easily remember you, you can make easy friends if you hang around the right crowd.

Most of my problems come from students behaviour to be honest. If they behaved then the teachers would be more on topic, classes would be controlled, they would wear uniform, etc. Also i wish the administration gave consequences for not wearing uniform becauseit makes you think ""whats the point of wearing it?"".

The kids in here ridicule you for speaking properly and excelling in test scores, absolutely unbelievable. I remember when I was entering the school, it claimed to be gifted. It's a lie. Besides the school itself, back in the day there was another school M.S. 391, a few blocks down that had students who would come over and terrorize kids at M.S. 394. I believed that most of the kids that attended that school came from the neighborhood projects, ""Albany Projects"". It got so bad that the parents became extremely concerned over safety and the school had to start releasing us 15 to 20 minutes early, just to get a head-start home. Kids started even sharpening pencils, just in case they needed to protect themselves by using it as a weapon. The teachers are okay I suppose. If you want to elevate your kids, who the majority are Black, don't make their lives any harder than it is by sending to this deathtrap.

17K394,3rd grade parent,brooklyn,K-8,366, This quality of teaching and learning at this school has deteriorated so much.  Class sizes are now averaging 35 and students are being under-served. Teachers in the low testing grades are always out and students are left to fend for themselves.  Substitutes are left to supervise classes and students are not properly prepared for the tests.  As a parent of a third grader I am extremely annoyed that with all the chaos going on at that school the Board of Education is not doing anything to fix these problems. My son was not even taught how to answer short response questions on the ela test he just had. Every year the scores get lower and the instruction gets poorer.  Many parents are looking to move their children. My son cannot stay there another year.

17K399,lily white,brooklyn,Elementary,330,"I  went to ps 399 and let me tell you that very few teachers if any are going to help your child if they are being bullied. I was bullied all through my elementary school years and teachers saw it. I had very few friends and instead of helping me ( I didn't speak much English and I didn't know how the other kids treated me was wrong because the teachers never said a thing so I didn't know how to ask for help) they either just kept quiet or acted antagonistically towards me. I remember when I was painting and a seniors pulled me aside to wash my hands because she somehow thought I painted an intricate design on my hands (I was wearing henna, it's part of Arab culture, needs time and professional to do it and not a 5 year old and needs hours to set). They kept taking me to the bathroom to wash my hands and the teacher just stuck her papers. The academics are less than impressive. This may have changed since I was there but we'd spend days if not weeks on one lesson. After school programs were the most time consuming and useless. I, as well as my younger siblings who attended that school, learned absolutely nothing and our state test scores barely changed despite the teachers constantly pushing the parents whose kids weren't in after school to go, regardless of how well they were already doing. Language is another thing that this school fails at. Instead of getting their own translators for students and parents who don't speak English, they decide that young children should do the translating and blame the child if the child does not know much of that language. I remember when a teacher pulled me out of class in the beginning of the day to go translate for an adult mother. This teacher expected a 6 year old to be a flawless translator. Keep in my mind that I was still learning English and the only Arabic I knew was the Arabic my parents used for me ( and parents are usually going to talk about dinner or when we're going outside. They're not going to be explaining how the enrollment process works or the different needs of a child. ). When I told the teacher I couldn't understand much of what the parent was saying, she took me back to class and at the end of the day when my father came to pick me up, she stopped us and told my father I needed to learn more Arabic and to take me back for a vacation to our home country because it was important for me to do this. It was apparently my job to function as a translator despite me trying to learn both English and more Arabic. I have not even gone into areas like club and activities. The teachers do absolutely nothing to engage with students and make the clubs seem more than just a chore. the teachers apparently force the students into clubs and the students have to say outright that they don't want to be in any clubs. I was forced into violent club and stayed there for years until I realized I could quit. Everyday was mind-numingly boring and exhausting and the teachers did nothing to make this seem like fun. Later, after I made one drawing, I was suddenly in a comic making club without asking for my permission or informing my parents (who were outside for an hour waiting for me until I told the teacher an excuse that I couldn't be in this club because I had too much to do and didn't want to go on stage, which was part of the club). After that, a teacher told me I had to be in a club if I wanted it took look good on my resumé. But, instead, I passed everyone else in academics in my middle school and most of that was because after I quit those clubs, I wasn't tired and exhausted so I had more time to do my homework and not count the time until bed time. All in all, I advise against sending a child to this school. This school made me hate learning and it wasn't until I left  that I actually started to enjoy learning and school. it wasn't just me that felt this way about this school. My younger brothers and cousins also hated this school and recieved treatment similar to me. I don't want my child to be introduced to their first years of learning by going to a school like this that doesn't even bother to try.

We recently received a new phone policy where we have to put our phones in locker pouches all day, which all of the students hate. The teachers at very informed in their fields, but a lot of the staff let their authority get to their head. It’s not too hard to build relationships with teachers, but there’s a teacher who actually encourages the students sucking up to her.

17K543,Michael Steele,brooklyn,Middle,220,"This school happens to be the Crown Jewel of District 17.  STAR is a screened 6-12 Early College School.  Thousands of children apply each year to get into the 6th or 9th grade when there are only 75-85 seat per grade.  I am fortunate, since I have two children -one in the 8th grade and one who recently got accepted into the 6th grade.  Before either of my child was accepted they needed to submit their school records including NYS ELA & Math Scores, report cards, attendance record, letter of recommendation and then they were required to take a school test in English and Mathematics.  After that they needed to prepared for an interview.   We were told that even if they did exceptionally well on every part of the screener it would not guarantee admission.  The students who attend STAR are exceptionally bright, goal oriented and equipped with an ""efficacious mindset"" bequeathed by the principal Dr. Blake.  The administration, who I have grown to admire as I've gotten to know them, are down to earth, accessible and committed to ensuring that our children receive a Tier 1 education.  Perhaps even more exciting are the opportunities that my kids will have as they ascend into the high school, which they are going to have to reapply to.  Conjecture though it may be, the students in STAR High School are even more high performing and ambitious then their middle school counterparts.  Some students complete almost two years of college, at Brooklyn College, while they are still
In high school.  I am, and anyone who knows anything about STAR will be, convinced that these kids are better prepared for college, since they spend most of their time at Brooklyn College in the junior and senior years of high school, then kids who attend schools like Brooklyn Tech, Bronx HS and to an extent Stuyversant.  Yes.  I am a bit biased because my kids attend this school, but if you look at STARs record of success you can easily see why I am, and so many other families are, passionate about this school.  The teachers are amazing and caring and always available to speak to whenever I need them.

He went above and beyond with monthly weekend trips for students and their families, extended time for parent/teacher conferences, weekly email updates, and was responsive to parental feedback and requests. The class also had a full time assistant teacher who was experienced, warm and competent. Our child grew a tremendous amount academically with a focus on phonics in particular, but also made close friends and thrived in social and emotional growth. 

Beyond the classroom, we were happy to find a diverse and active PTA and a principal who has regular time with parents and seems receptive to feedback. The parent coordinator, Kibibi, does an outstanding job. 

We are happily starting our child in kindergarten this year. Our only concerns so far is some amount of turnover in teaching staff between the two years, but it is too early to know if that is a trend or concern. We also are happy to see the school focused on preserving diversity, and hope 705 can maintain this.  

When you drop off kids at 705 in the morning you will see a group of kids running happily towards a door that is held open by a familiar and smiling face.

17K705,Jon Keegan,brooklyn,Elementary,334,"We're just wrapping up our first year at 705 as my son completes a fantastic year of Pre-K with Ms. Sosa (who is amazing, by the way). 


We feel so lucky to be part of this special community. As a first time participant in the NYC public school system I was amazed at how involved the parent community is in the school. I have witnessed a really positive, healthy camaraderie with the administration as parents and the school staff strive to achieve the same goals. 


Kelly's comments about the school being a ""start-up"" are right on. A start-up in the best sense of the term. I have a three year old who will be starting Pre-K here in another year, and I'm excited about all that we can accomplish at this fantastic school. Yes, it truly is a diverse community. The school administration is keenly aware of the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood that it finds itself in, and is continually working to make sure that this is a school for all of the children and families in Crown Heights, and not just those who recently arrived. Kibibi Oyo, the parent teacher coordinator has lived in the neighborhood for a long time, and she has proven to be a responsive, thorough and friendly face of the school for day to day interactions with families.  


Principal Soto cares deeply about all of her children at the school, and is very accessible. She really is a remarkable leader. We've joined her for her frequent open breakfast meetings at the school, and it's been satisfying seeing her achieve her stated goals for the school over the course of the year. She's transparent when things don't work out exactly as planned, and remains flexible about the ways the school can provide the best for the kids of 705.",0,0,0,2015-06-24T20:06:14,1.0,0.14400000000000002,0.275,0.105,0.8440000000000001,0.177,0.539,0.048,0.488,0.275,0.168,0.222
17K705,Tim Thomas,brooklyn,Elementary,334,"Simply put, this a great school. The principal is awesome, the teachers are super. We attended Pre-k and loved Miss Sosa. We gave our daughter the option to choose to stay at 705 or go to PS38, because we were torn, as was she. We went to PS38 and are very happy there too. Our kid liked the colors of the school walls and the library with bean bag chairs and the fact that a drumming class was going on when we visited 38. Sometimes, fate rests on weird choices like that. My life is full of ""bean bag"" choices, and I'm still standing.

I echo what Kelly said about convenience of a school. Where we are now is equal distant from our house, but in a different direction. If it were any farther, we'd be super bummed. You have to remember that you're going to go to this location a couple hundred times a year - round trip! Don't take that decision lightly. We know people who killed themselves to get into their first choice, stalking the principal and all, but now they're dying from the commute. Eventually they'll probably do the school bus, but their kid will be on the bus an hour each way. Since this is elementary school, I think it's enormously helpful to family life to stay within a reasonable commute. If you don't hear that comment from anyone else, I'm glad you just read it! It's super important. I get to spend more time with my darling daughters as a result.

Give 705 a tour. Check in with the PTA and principal. I suspect you'll immediately feel this could be a great option for you kid.",1,0,0,2015-01-31T19:36:07,1.0,0.14400000000000002,0.275,0.105,0.8440000000000001,0.177,0.539,0.048,0.488,0.275,0.168,0.222
17K705,Kelly,brooklyn,Elementary,334,"This is my second comment on this page. My first was when my son was in Pre-K at 705. He is now a proud 705 first grader, so it's high time for an update. Apologies in advance for its length. I'm still marveling at our good fortune in finding this school and being a part of its formative years. There hasn't been a single day when he hasn't sprinted out the door to school. He's a flexible kid, but he's also discerning -- he knows how to recognize a good thing. At 705, he is learning, and he is loved. He's had two truly excellent teachers in three years; one seasoned, one new but very capable. Reading and math are clicking into place, the Spanish is sinking in, he's come home spouting scientific facts, he regales me with stories about the lives of composers. Etc.

Yes, we have lost some families. The NYC public school system encourages shopping and trading up, and who can fault people for questing for the perfect fit, especially in a time when we channel so much anxious energy into our parenting? 705 is still a startup, with rough edges that are not to everyone's taste. Some wonderful families that attended for a while and moved on did not live within walking distance of the school, which is something that, for us, seals the deal. Plus, many people are afraid (mistakenly, I believe) of junior high in D17, and so seek seats elsewhere.

But believe it or not, almost half of his original Pre-K class is still in the same classroom together this year (with others in another first-grade class), along with many of the great kids who joined up last year in Kindergarten (and some of those kids in another first-grade class, as well). And he's meeting lovely new kids all the time. He's in a bridge class this year, first and second graders together, designed to aggregate native Spanish speakers in a way that will best serve the needs of all kids. It's an innovative way to do things. That's how Principal Soto rolls. She experiments, she calibrates, she's always thinking. 

Yes, the kids do worksheets. But they also do art projects, sing songs, play instruments, take dance and gym class, read lots of books, and, believe it or not, get assessed on things like empathy and impulse control, aka ""habits of mind"" (http://www.edutopia.org/blog/habits-of-mind-terrell-heick). Not in any way that will ""go down on your permanent record,"" (to quote the Violent Femmes, because ... why not) but in a way that's supremely helpful to parents who value emotional intelligence and Paul Tough-style ""grit"" and want to understand what their kids really excel at and struggle with, day to day, as they learn how to learn, and how to get along with other people.

Melissa's comment below touched me deeply. She nailed it, I think. I did not attend Brooklyn public schools, so I have been getting my own education the past 2.5 years. It has been the most eye-opening, challenging, rewarding experience of my life, seeing my neighborhood and my neighbors and the future of our city from this angle, stepping outside myself to get to know people who are very different from me, and pitching in to help build something.

I don't fault anyone new to the system for having unrealistic expectations of what a public school can provide. (It is outrageous, outrageous, that basically every single ""extra"" in the most popular NYC public schools among upper-middle-class parents—including extra teaching hands in our too-crowded classrooms—is paid for out of pocket by those same upper-middle-class parents. We all should be really pissed off about that.) But to her point, real diversity is not always comfortable. Real diversity means a wide spectrum of beliefs in practice at the same time. Real diversity means that the school needs to stretch to accommodate many different kinds of needs. How would you run a school with both students who attended high-priced private preschool and students who live in homeless shelters? How would you apportion your resources, your time? And what would you hope that those kids take away from their time spent with one another? 

In the end, I honestly believe my son (and my daughter, for whom the first day of 705 Pre-K can't come fast enough) could build critical thinking skills and learn to read and appreciate literature and get the building blocks of math and science and learn about the wider world (as much as you can really learn about the wider world without experiencing it firsthand) at many schools. Only here can they walk a few blocks, and walk into a loving community of teachers and classmates that actively seeks to reflect, understand, and learn from the fascinating environment immediately surrounding it. 

Oh and a quick shout-out to our new parent coordinator, Kibibi Oyo, who is a longtime neighborhood resident and who has done a wonderful job in a few short months of meeting ALL our needs, communicating clearly to all, and bringing us together. I'm really impressed. Ditto our PTA leadership in co-presidents Michael Sclafani and Amina DeLeon. They make a good team. Thanks, guys.",0,0,0,2014-12-07T06:12:40,1.0,0.14400000000000002,0.275,0.105,0.8440000000000001,0.177,0.539,0.048,0.488,0.275,0.168,0.222
17K705,Melissa,brooklyn,Elementary,334,"My son is at PS 705 and we are really pleased with what we are seeing happening at this school. First and foremost, my son is in first grade and is reading, doing arithmetic, evolving his vocabulary and showing a more mature understanding of personal dynamics, history, geography and more. His teacher is Mrs Jones and she is a seasoned instructor with a firm, kind approach to learning. There is a para in the class - Mr Nelson - who lends a nice and needed male presence in a room filled with lots of energetic boys.

I have seen comments about the PTA being disorganized and Ms Soto's ""vision"" not coming to life and I feel quite the opposite. Anyone who has been a part of anything entrepreneurial or new knows that growth is a process and takes time. In the beginning of its third year, this school has committed to its direction and is doing a great job staying on course. Stumbling blocks, certainly, but passion and commitment? No doubt! 

If I were to share a complaint it would be more about the parents than anything else. I have led prospective parent tours, and I hear lots of questions from parents that are quite frankly unrealistic. I believe that there are families looking at this school that have little to no understanding of what the public school system in NYC is all about. 

I think one of the reasons why parents are taking their kids out of the school is due to their misunderstanding of what diversity might look like, as well as their own inability to get involved - be a part of the solution not the problem. We talk about wanting a neighborhood school reflective of the community - Crown Heights - but many parents ultimately want something different that they are unwilling to admit. I am a product of Brooklyn public schools in the 70s so I believe I have a pretty realistic sense of what diversity looks like. 

My family made the choice to move to District 17 and we are happy that there is a nurturing, educational environment in our district that is delivering care and instruction to kids from the area. If you too are living in the zone or even in the district and want to be a part of a community where your voice is heard, where the principal knows your name, where kids are learning from others, then this school is for you.",0,0,0,2014-12-04T12:14:56,1.0,0.14400000000000002,0.275,0.105,0.8440000000000001,0.177,0.539,0.048,0.488,0.275,0.168,0.222
17K705,Dahlia,brooklyn,Elementary,334,"PS 705 is our zoned school.  I really wanted to love this school due to the proximity from our home.  Our commute could definitely not be easier.  I heard mixed reviews from past parents but wanted to give it a chance for my Pre-K child.  This school has been given a lot of praise for a District 17 school but really it comes down to there not being a better option in the district and the past PTA President being really great with PR.  The parents want to love the school and want you to love it but I often feel that they are still trying to convince themselves that it really is a good school. The PTA meetings have low attendance, are disorganized, and are incredibly unproductive.  Principal Soto is a great visionary but not so great with the execution.  And the execution of the amazing plan is what really counts.  The school was sold to everyone as a school that offered dual language throughout all of the grades.  This year they decided to do away with the dual language program at the Pre-K level due to not being able to recruit enough Spanish speakers.  This of course was not told to parents until school assignments were already out. They should not sell parents on something that they aren’t going to offer. Communication at this school is very poor.  They do not keep their website current and the front office staff are useless. The parent coordinator is enthusiastic and another visionary but again, not so great at the execution.  The
school is a lot of talk about being “progressive” but it’s really not even as
progressive as the public school that I went to 20 years ago.  If anything, they are far behind.  Principal Soto seems to employ very green teachers with not a lot of class management skills.  Principal Soto talks about their amazing gym teacher but not all Pre-K students event have gym class.  The school seems to really be most fond of the children that “shut up and listen” versus the children that think outside
of the box and ask a lot of questions. If your child has any character or creativity and is in any way stubborn then this is not the school for you. Creativity is not well received regardless of what the principal tells you.  The teachers merely do what is
required of them and rarely do anything above and beyond.  They set the bar low so that children meet their expectations versus raising the bar and having children rise to the occasion.  If you simply want your child to just do worksheet after worksheet instead of making lessons interesting then you have found a great fit.  The lessons are not inspiring and the art projects lack creativity.  Many parents leave the school as soon as they have a better opportunity for their child.  I read through the list of comments below prior to adding my own.  I saw that several of the parents with the praising reviews have already left the school for better schools in a different district.  I have spoken to several of them personally and they said that they did not realize how much the school was lacking until they left.  It is merely an adequate school.  Your child more than likely will not be inspired to learn or enjoy school. If you have a chance to send your child to a school out of District 17 then definitely do so.  Pre-K here is pretty much free daycare.  And when your child hits 1st grade and education really matters they are really not going to be getting what they need.  You will be disappointed and will more than likely need to hire a tutor just to keep your child where they need to be.  If this is your only option, fine.  But if you have another option then take it  This school may be great in 10-15 years but don't waste your child's important elementary years with a school that is severely lacking.  It's not worth it.",0,0,0,2014-11-04T15:22:19,1.0,0.14400000000000002,0.275,0.105,0.8440000000000001,0.177,0.539,0.048,0.488,0.275,0.168,0.222

Students are often not given the appropriate accommodations that they are legally bind to. The facility is shared with a high-performing charter school whose white-collared shirt scholars are held to a high standard and are a huge contrast to the disorderly green jumpsuit-wearing students who attend New Heights. This dichotomy inflicts self esteem issues among the students who attend this school and can seriously impact his/her value of education in the future. Safety wise, there have been occasions where students were suspended for bringing weapons and other dangerous items to school. Instead of going to class, a handful of disreputable students wander the hallways without repercussions and distract teachers and students from learning. I have seen students enter this school with such potential, only to be overcome by the hostile environment they find themselves in and forced to fight, associate themselves with gang culture, and disregard their education completely. 


I would recommend finding a public school or charter school outside of this community.

It would seem that you have a negative attitude about the school but you have yet to state the part that you may have played in the ""disorderly"" students within in the building. I believe that if you have a set system that is effective in curbing the negative behaviors of students within your classroom then it may then translate to curbing their negative behaviors outside the classroom. Just as you only can influence students within your room and pray it takes root, it is the same with a school on a whole. A school and its culture are only a small portion of what makes a child. It is not the schools fault that a child believes that it is ok to act a certain way. 

You say that students have potential. The fact that you see the potential means that someone in the school fostered that potential to make it noticeable to you. So do not blame the whole school on the behaviors and negative aspects found in small instances. The fact that you taught in the school means that there must have been something that you found of worth to keep you there , even if only for a year.

They play to each others strengths and allow the large classes to be broken into smaller groups that are based on ability so no child is in an area that they might fall behind in. I think it allows the students to learn to be flexible with their learning because they can get used to different teaching styles/personalities. And the teachers loop with the students so there is no adjustment period in the beginning of the school year. We love the HEARTS curriculum and has helped teach social emotional learning to our child.

17K770,Robin B,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"I am a current parent at PS770 with two kids enrolled, one in 4th grade and one in 1st. We have been at the school since my 4th grader was in pre-k. I have served on the PTA and been a class parent so I have seen the school through many different lenses. I am also a public school DOE teacher and have the opportunity to see lots of other schools and how they do things. I can say, without hesitation, that 770 is a superb school. 

Before the current situation of remote learning we were thrilled with the teaching staff and the principal, Jessica Saratovsky. They have such passion for the students and really engage our children in learning. The content and rigor of the lessons is of a high quality. I am constantly impressed by the projects they are working on. 

Since we have been in remote learning due to Covid 19 the quality of the teaching and the passion for education has shone through. Our teachers were ready that first Monday with live teaching and lessons that were appropriate for the students' needs taking into consideration the stress of the situation, various family needs and technology issues. They have continued to show up for our kids each day as this has progressed. It has been a source of comfort and stability in a time of uncertainty for our kids. They continue to introduce new content, but in ways that are manageable, both for the parents at home and the students.

17K770,Kristina Anderson,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"We have one daughter in 1st grade and a second who will be entering PreK in the fall, and have been parents here since our oldest was in PreK. We are a family with lots of choice in where we could send our children. We continue to choose P.S. 770 over other options because <b>the school attracts top educators interested in pursuing a unique approach to teaching</b>. This approach focuses on building relationships with the children, then staying with them (""looping"" that has been mentioned). This means that in September they can hit the ground running versus spending weeks getting to know where the child is academically and socially. [Note that unlike what is reported in the description, the looping doesn't happen from K-5 but K-2 and 3-5]. The benefit of the ""teaching team"" structure is that the teachers can provide different levels of academic instruction: the grade is housed in one large class, but is broken up into ""houses"" that are fluid and rotate for core subjects like math, reading, and spelling (fundations). My oldest is learning how to be a better citizen, a more caring person through attention to relationships and social activism. But she's also preparing and will be ready for admission to a top middle school. <b>Academics are not sacrificed for the social-emotional work that's being done in the classroom. </b>

Finally,<b> the open door policy and no homework policy have been big draws for us</b>. I didn't realize until we were already at P.S. 770 that many schools don't let parents into the classroom without express advance permission. At P.S. 770 you can come anytime, no questions asked. You can go into your own child's classroom, or go visit another. You can stay 10 minutes or all day. This is a great way to understand what's happening with your child in the classroom, and can answer many questions for you first-hand. The instructors are available to you offline, as well, and the focus on relationship-building extends to the parent community, too. And Principal Saratovsky also makes herself available above and beyond what could normally be expected of a principal.

And, although the no-homework policy can be quite controversial, the ""homework"" as we normally would see it is actually being done in the class. Except in PreK which is play-based learning, the children hear a lesson, then work the problem individually or in small groups in the moment. <b>There is always opportunity, should a parent want it, to use the provided bonus homework problems sent home each work. </b>They aren't officially graded, but the teachers are fierce advocates for your child and I have no doubt would be happy to go over the work if asked. 

In summary: we are there for the ""special sauce"" that happens in the classroom. That sauce is a mix of strong academic instruction and focus on social-emotional learning (aka relationship building).",0,0,0,2020-05-22T11:45:53,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21
17K770,N.M.,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"This school is a spectacular, special find for Brooklyn parents. We are so glad that we chose this school for our son. The teaching model, which utilizes a team of teachers for each grade, ensures that students receive a variety of teaching styles, and a true community of support for the students' learning. Teachers work together to create a cohesive curriculum, which each teacher specializing in one area-- the result is a dynamic classroom that always keeps students engaged. Hands on learning is truly an integral part of this school-- as well as wonderful arts education teachers for dance, music, and visual arts. The student-to-teacher ratios is unparalleled for a public school, and the teachers are accessible, kind, and exceptionally dedicated. 
The classrooms are very spacious with high ceilings, a lot of light-- and are separated into different areas for each teacher. This allows students to move around from lesson to lesson and not be confined to one small room. Exactly what young learners need. 

Of course, now we are not in the classroom but at home. During this particularly challenging time with the COVID-19 quarantine, we have really been blown away by how fantastic the distance-learning set up has been. We've heard form other parents about teachers at other schools meeting the kids just once a day and then giving homework to do-- but the model that PS 770 has come up with is so much more effective. Students meet for short, subject-specific meetings with the different teachers on the teaching team. this ensures that our 1st grader is never bored-- and also never overwhelmed. They have created the perfect balance and it has been a life saver. It is just a testament to how competent and fabulous the teaching teams are at PS 770.

17K770,itisnotnothing,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"In this time of COVID 19, I wanted to come back here to share our experience of the school's efforts. I truly believe PS 770 to be an example for how to continue education remotely. When schools were closed, the administration and faculty took three days to convene and plan how to keep teaching. Principal Saratovsky has long done an excellent job of applying for grants, and as such the school was prepared and was able to distribute over 100 devices to children who had none. By the following Monday, they were up online with a full schedule including live teacher delivery, including their music, dance, and gym classes. They also record the lessons so that students could catch up when it best fit their family's schedule. 

Teachers have been very communicative about trying to find out how the change has worked for students, and have made adjustments. My two girls understand what is expected of them and are able to complete most everything asked. In some ways they even prefer aspects of this school day as they don't have to wake up as early or commute to school, though they miss being able to see their friends in person. The quality of teaching hasn't fallen off at all, despite having to learn to move content online with no notice, and then having to adjust from Zoom classrooms to Google Meet over a weekend.

17K770,H.H.,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"This is an exceptional school. My son is in pre-k. He loves it.  We just got our kindergarten acceptance and we couldn't be more excited to stay through fifth grade.  Academically, my son is learning a lot - obvious progress in reading, writing, and math, and also delving into more complex science, social studies, and interdisciplinary topics. His class did a unit on light, and he came home talking about different artificial and natural sources; on another day they used scales, and he came home excited to explain that a smaller number of heavy things can weigh more than a greater number of lighter things. It's something new every day. And much of what he learns is related to becoming a responsible citizen and community member. Complex concepts of racial, social and environmental justice have been introduced in ways he's capable of understanding and asking more and more sophisticated questions about. The school provides a ton of enrichment as well, with full time phys ed, music and dance teachers (and dedicated space in the building for each), and an art residency program. The pre-k has access to its own rooftop playground right from their classrooms, and they're outside once or twice a day. It's a small school. Everyone in the building - teachers, administrators, and even many parents - know all the children, providing an incredibly warm environment. 

The social-emotional learning has also been a real highlight. The school uses HEARTS values, with each letter standing for a different positive social/emotional value (humility, empowerment, responsibility etc). Within a couple of months, he'd so internalized these values that even at home, if he's picking on his little sister or refusing to clean up his toys, I can ask what HEARTS value he's demonstrating, and he'll often apologize and change his behavior. He's four, and of course it doesn't always work, but it's obvious he understands and embraces the positive values he's learning.

It's been a great experience for us as parents as well. Our son's teachers are always accessible. The classrooms are open, with parents welcome and encouraged to to visit. Every six weeks or so, there's a formal opportunity for all parents to come see what their kids have been working on, which is also a great chance to get to know his teachers, get a real feel for how the classroom operates, and meet other students and families. 

Ms. Saratovsky, the principal, is also unusually accessible and willing to discuss or explain anything, any time. She's at the door at drop off and pick up every day, holds regular parent forums, and hands out her email to parents the first time she meets them.

If you're wondering what the school's policy is about something, or why it isn't something else, ask her! She'll discuss it with you. 

Ms. Saratovsky uses the same approach with students as she does with parents, both showing and teaching kids respect for others and responsibility for themselves. She doesn't dictate behavior to students, instead educating them to make informed and kind decisions - as when she had some of the school's older students think through and prepare presentations for each other on why they had or had not chosen to kneel for the pledge at the school's morning meeting, or when she had students who had used bullying words toward their friends look up the words' meanings and discuss whether and why they had or had not used them appropriately.  The same approach is used by teachers, even in the pre-k classroom, where students are taught and encouraged to examine their own behavior and solve problems they and others create.  The result, for my son at least, is an environment where he feels challenged, respected, invested, and ready to learn.

17K770,Kaitlin Holt,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"I have so many positive things to say about PS 770, it's difficult to decide where to start! My profession as an informal educator has provided me with significant exposure to Brooklyn's public schools, so it was easy to recognize from early interactions how special PS 770 is compared to other options in our borough. In 7 years of teaching in NYC, I have never come across a principal as communicative as Jessica Saratovsky and this commitment to communication is pervasive throughout the entire school. This school really goes out of its way to provide ample opportunities for parents to converse with staff (digitally/in-person, during the day/evenings), which illustrates not only its commitment to its students and their families, but an intrinsic understanding of parents' different scheduling and communication needs. Case in point, school tours for prospective families are offered in the evenings as well as during the school day. 

Others have mentioned the diversity of the school's student population, but what's just as important is the school's dedication to culturally relevant/responsive pedagogy and critically conscious teaching practices. It's not enough to have students attend a ""diverse"" school; they need to see this diversity represented in their instruction. The message that whiteness needs to be de-centered is being communicated in an impactful way at PS 770. In our one year at the school (our child is in Kindergarten), teachers have participated in mandatory anti-biased training, Ms. Saratovsky has openly shared her participation in decolonizing education cohort, a number of parents have joined a six month antiracism training and the PTA offered a free undoing racism workshop for the entire parent community. 

And now, we're in the midst of Covid-19. PS 770 has gone out of the way to get technology into the hands of the students who need it most. Staff sacrificed their own health to make a trip back to the school after it closed to collect and deliver laptops to students that needed them after the DOE's promise to provide these devices failed to materialize in the promised timespan. During this exceptionally challenging and emotionally and physically taxing time, our teachers are offering live instruction from roughly 9am-2pm every school day. In speaking with a handful of friends with kids at other schools it seems none are doing as much as PS 770 and I mean this as an absolute compliment. The community understands the suffering a lot of our families are going through and the communication has been as clear as ever that the intention is to do as much as each family feels is right for them. Our kids have different needs, learning styles and attention spans, but despite this the teachers have excelled at making my family at least feel exceptionally supported - they've truly offered a bit of respite, consistency and happiness in this troubling time and we're so so so thankful and proud to be a part of the PS 770 community now more than ever.",0,0,0,2020-04-09T19:46:06,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21
17K770,itisnotnothing,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"We have two daughters who have been attending PS770 since Pre-K and are currently heading into 4th and 2nd grades. We love the school for many reasons. Unlike the vast majority of schools in the city, 770 is actually a diverse school. Students come from across District 17 and several other surrounding areas, and they reflect the broad range of neighborhoods in this district. Our daughters see it and live it each day and are learning the value of that diversity. When they attend various summer day camps or see other schools on the street they routinely complain if the groups are too homogenous because it feels artificial to them. That's invaluable to me. The school does a good job of trying to address notions of cultural identity and difference and how to reach across those divides, not only among the students, but among the parent body as well. It's not simple or easy, but for those reasons, much of the rest of the world isn't trying at all. It's helping to build a close knit community around the school. We have watched friends leave the school for G and T schools and then return quickly because they missed the 770 family atmosphere. The school is one of the few open campuses around. As a parent, you're always welcome to come observe a class or to plan with teachers to help teach a lesson.

I've been extremely impressed with the school's work with social emotional development. Our girls have had some conflicts in personality with classmates over the years (as all kids do), and the teachers have taken time out to work with everyone involved to be able to identify what is happening between them and to help them come up with their own solutions. It's led to a level of emotional maturity that many adults could aspire to. I really can't say enough of the school's work here. 

Previous comments mentioned the DOE's change to the school's teaching structure. It was very disappointing, as the master teacher system was really great for developing younger teachers and for pulling kids out within the class day for both enrichment and remediation. That's something we miss. That said, the teachers are true professionals and have continued to provide a quality education to the students, finding ways to challenge them at their own levels. They largely deliver content via project based learning, letting the kids drive much of the content, which helps them learn critical thinking strategies at each grade level. Our 3rd grader recently completed a segment on climate change and social activism that saw the class produce a 20 minute newscast as a culminating project. The kids broke into groups as anchors, meteorologists, field reporters, environmental scientists, advertising developers, and animators. They wrote scripts, staged, recorded and edited the movie. They employed green screen work and stop motion animation in addition to acting and doing all the set design. The teachers had a ton of work to do keeping all these groups on task, and the kids really pulled it off. It was a truly interdisciplinary unit from a bunch of 8 and 9 year olds.

Things are generally improving incrementally each year as well. Since we started at the school 5 years ago we have added full-time gym, music, and dance teachers who have really enriched the school. The PTA has been fundraising to bring in supplemental visual art programming from Art Yard and Henry Street, and parents are working with teachers to find more ways to intertwine art within the curriculum. Parent involvement has also brought a small garden to the outdoor space at the school. The administration and parents have worked to form relationships with local politicians and in winning grants to fund various STEM initiatives and bring an impressive amount of technology to the school. There are more areas that could be strengthened as in most schools, but the trajectory within what is still a young school has been steadily upward, and parent input and help is generally welcomed.",0,0,0,2019-06-16T18:03:01,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

17K770,Jean Kumagai,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"Our two kids have been at PS770 since pre-K and are now in second grade. We love the school. It’s small enough that there’s an intimate, friendly vibe. We love the no-homework policy, and the sensible attitude toward standardized testing. We never feel the teachers are teaching to the test – indeed, the inquiry-based, integrated curriculum is really thoughtful. The principal is very receptive to input from parents. We appreciate the school’s “love and logic” philosophy, which translates into respect for every person in the building. Not that there’s never any screaming, but compared to most schools, it’s pretty serene.

The teachers’ pay cuts chronicled in the Daily News story were demoralizing, no doubt about that. But it really seems like PS770’s teachers and administration have been resilient and generally moved beyond the DOE’s decision. I’ve seen no evidence that the change has “ruin[ed] the school’s upbeat spirit,” as the Daily News story suggested. Far from it. I feel like this year is the best year we’ve experienced at the school. Among other things, there’s now a full-time music teacher, which the school hasn’t had in the time we’ve been there. The after-school program is now run by Trail Blazers, which has been an excellent addition—we love their focus on the environment and that the kids spend time outside every afternoon. And PS770 was recently selected to be a partner of the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, which will create an art gallery within the school and provide visual arts instruction to every student.

So are there any downsides? Some kids will find the open classroom overly stimulating; one of my sons falls into that category, and so he and his teacher come up with strategies to help him focus. Also, the air conditioning doesn’t really work, the restrooms are pretty antiquated, the auditorium needs an overhaul. But I’m convinced that the teachers at PS770 are among the very best in the city and that my kids are getting an excellent education in a vibrant, diverse, loving environment.",0,0,0,2017-11-14T22:33:14,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

17K770,Sarah Blackwood,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"Our son is in kindergarten at PS 770, and we have been extremely happy with our choice to enroll him. I went on many tours of public schools in our district, and outside of it, considered charter schools, and did my share of fretting about the decision. I have yet to see a NYC public school with brighter or larger classrooms. The kids have space to spread out, explore, and work on their project-based play and learning. The classrooms are not at all chaotic, despite the number of little kids in them. I know other Brooklyn parents who are worried over the amount of homework their five year olds are bringing home with them. PS 770 is a no-homework school and has been on the forefront, since its inception, with incorporating the evidence-based findings that homework does not help students master skills or knowledge into its approach to curriculum and learning.

We love that our son has four teachers in his classroom with close knowledge of him as a person and a student; this teaching model is vibrant and productive, and I know that my son feels respected and cared for during the school day.

The school community is warm and active and is not shying away from the hard questions that attend public school in NYC: the principal hosts parent forums that find parents from all walks having engaging conversations with one another about parenting and education. The school is committed to maintaining the diversity (class, race, ethnicity) of its student population; a supported, diverse student population is good for *all* and more public schools should be working toward this goal as 770 is.

In all, PS 770's curriculum and structure exhibits some of the best research-supported approaches in education: no homework, an hour of daily exercise (rain, snow, or shine!), a diverse student population, project-based learning, and supporting and developing emotional intelligence in each student. The school is still new and growing; the PTA is continuing to develop and organize, but we love that we will have the opportunity to grow with the school.",0,0,0,2016-10-25T18:34:24,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

17K770,dollface,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"After a conversation this morning with a stressed mom at another school -- who was told that her kindergartener was ""too far behind"" and ""won't graduate from kindergarten"" because she wasn't up to par with the other kids -- I was moved to write this review of PS 770. Simply because we don't have these stresses. Instead of teachers who push the kids too hard at a young age, we have teachers who encourage and love our kids. I have a daughter in the 2nd grade and a son in pre-K, and we can't say enough about our school. The TNAA model encourages excitement for learning, to a level where both of our kids can't wait to go to school. The school is diverse and inclusive. They use their 6-week curriculum courses to pull in all areas of learning and keep everything more interesting for the students. The teachers are observant and really care about each student. Our daughter is ahead of the curve in a lot of areas, but has some hand-eye coordination problems with her writing, and her teachers went out of their way to find solutions to help her, even before we had her evaluated for her IEP. Never once did she feel as though she was lacking, or that she had to ""just try harder"" -- they keep her excitement for learning up, and she loves her IEP sessions when they happen. 

I spent the morning making this other mom feel better, trying to get her to understand that her daughter is normal and that she just learns differently, and crying with her as she asserted that she was trying her best and that she just feels so bad for her kid. The thing is, her daughter IS normal. She is only in kindergarten, and no one should be this stressed out in school at this age. And I realized that sometimes, I take our school for granted -- until I'm faced with another parent's real concern over his/her kid's education. In the long run, I want my kids to be happy going to school and excited to learn, because it sets up the right mindset and skills for their educational future. And PS 770 answers all of that. I'm so grateful for Ms. Saratovsky, the Bessie Coleman team, and everyone at our school for making it such a wonderful environment.",0,0,0,2016-10-07T14:35:10,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21
17K770,Kat,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"Our son has now completed almost a full year in PS 770, and we are very pleased with the school. He went to play-based preschool, so we were worried about kindergarten transition, and quite frankly did not agree with the whole idea of full-on academics being forced upon as young children as 5-year-old. We also did not like the idea of being slammed with daily homework that we did not see benefit with, but only a risk to the motivation of young students. We have been so happy with PS 770 being able to balance academics with other important aspects of students lives (social growth, creativity, individual attention..) We love the classroom setup (library, play corner etc), daily exercise and outdoor-time. School is open to parents and we feel involved and welcomed as we are often invited to classroom to observe/participate in student's projects. School is also diverse (and equal), which was also one of our hopes, taken that we live in a city where it is possible, but still not necessarily common. We were first worried about the behavioral charts (as another reviewer put it), but the way they were incorporated seemed to be beneficial, so our worries quickly disappeared. We are also excited that the teacher's will loop with our son and they can continue next fall where they left of (and his teachers have an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each student right away).

The classrooms are enormous, filled with natural light and I love that my child is being taught by a team of three teachers as well as having a full time staff helper. The 48 students are divided into three houses and my daughter had no trouble moving from the 6 family co-op pre-school/ playgroup we had her in for 4 years into this inspired version of education that is happening at PS770. The school encourages independence and rewards students for showing empathy and responsibility. My husband and I visited 9 schools before deciding on 770 and we love the progressive atmosphere among the teachers and parent community. 
In terms of homework, I love that the practice packets are distributed on Fridays and are not mandatory. Our family's work schedule would make daily homework unfeasible!
The school is small, with one class per grade and the small staff recognizes my voice when I call. I didn't know that would be so important to me, but it is. The teachers at PS770 have embraced the common core standards and continue to revise their teaching strategies during their 90 minutes of prep time each day. 
The co-location with PS398 has been a good experience so far and I am on a first name basis with at least 5 people who work there and have had some laughs with the parents I've gotten to know during drop off and pick up.
I do hope PS770 will be able to expand to meet the growing interest. The main drawback for me is that the school is 3 miles from where we live and travelling to and from school at ""bus o'clock"" is more of a chore than I realized. There is no other place I'd consider sending my kid in district 17.

Student/Teacher ratio, integrated curriculum, looping teachers and large, bright classrooms are just a few of the things that brought us to 770, but the teaching staff and the administration are even better than we could have hoped.
When I have visited the classrooms, I've seen children who are really engaged in the lesson plans and teachers who really love and are dedicated to their work.
I've seen how much our son has grown in the short time he has been there and I've really been impressed at how the school really strives to teach to the whole child, not just his head, but his heart too!",0,0,0,2014-01-17T01:18:11,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

17K770,Amanda Schulman Brokaw,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"I have two children at PS 770, one in Pre-K and one in 1st grade.  I cannot say enough about how pleased I have been with the school as a community and as a truly unique source of education for my sons. Both of my children come home every day bubbling over with information and I love the way that each theme in the curriculum is used as a jumping off point for truly exiting writing, math, art, history, and science explorations.  Ms. Saratovsky, the school's headmaster, holds a forum for parents to attend every Friday morning.  This is an invaluable time where parents can have direct access to her to speak about the school and to discuss parenting issues. This year Ms. Saratovsky has introduced RULER, an emotional intelligence program, to the school and has been using the forum to train the parents in this curriculum so that we can reinforce what is going on in the school and implement some of the techniques in our own home.  Every month the PTA (full disclosure, I'm on the board) hosts Second Saturday-- a Saturday afternoon family event that gives all of the families in our community a safe and fun and affordable activity for the afternoon.  We've hosted an arts and crafts event, a magic show and ice cream social, a kiddie disco and a movie afternoon.
I am thrilled with the way that the school is teaching my children to ask questions and explore and love learning without placing an inordinate amount of time on testing and test-taking skills. And I am really pleased with the open atmosphere that has been created at the school, an atmosphere that values parents as an integral part of a child's education and allows us to be equal participants in every aspect of what the school does.  
If you are looking for an innovative public school option for your child, I would definitely recommend taking a look at PS 770.

On our visit to curriculum day this month, we saw 4 year olds excitedly displaying what they have learned through demonstration, Q&A and song.  it was so refreshing to see the interaction between the teacher and students.  Ms. Brittany and Ms. Camille should be commended for the work they are doing.  The children were responsive, respectful and very well-behaved.  

I would also like to echo the comments below that the headmaster, Jessica Saratovsky, is smart, accessible and practical.  She is working hard to improve the educational experience for the students and  families in the TNAA community.  

It may be true that the school suffered a temporary set-back to their middle school expansion plans, but I have full faith that this model will continue to evolve and expand to include not only a middle school but a high school as well.  

If you have a child in District 17 or even Brooklyn, you would be wise to visit TNAA and consider this a great option for your child's education.

Only 22 students took the test at TNAA last year, which was the first year of testing there. This is not a significant enough sample to make a true evaluation of the school.  If you look at DOE results you will see that school is given NA as grade as far as test scores are concerned since the sample was so small.

17K770,Yelena Girdo,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"I did a lot of work to find a good school for my daughter.
My criteria were diversity,


challenging work, and safety. We live on Flatbush next to
Prospect Park and in this neighborhood the PS are not good. My friend told me
about PS770. First I read their web-site, some articles about the school and
parents’ reviews. Their philosophy sounded good but 60 kids in one classroom
didn’t sound right for me. Also parents’ reviews were 50/50 and location seemed
to be unsafe. I decided to go for a tour just because this PS was different and
my friends really liked it. What I saw was beyond my expectations. I spent 2
hours observing 1st graders at work. There was no problem with
discipline at all. That was impressive. The classroom was huge so noise level
from one group to another didn’t seem a big deal for me anymore. Kids were
focusing on their activities.  The
facility is really nice and airy. I liked the idea that my child will deal with
different teachers and those teachers will stay with the class through the
whole elementary school. Also, what was important for me, that differentiation
can really take place with that system. 
Diversity: this year Kindergarten is much more diverse because a lot of
kids from my neighborhood joined the school. I believe next year it will be
even more diverse. Safety: though the school shares the building with PS398 but
its’ students don’t interact with PS770 (not during lunch time, not during
recess)  - I feel my child is safe. I
also like that kids spend 30-40 minutes outside each day. The school has pretty
good afterschool program: art and karate. 
I wish they had more art and music classes during school hours but I
solved this problem by enrolling my daughter in different classes on the
weekend. Now we are in the middle of January and I can see changes in my
daughter behavior – she is more interested in reading, she has become more
patient and her vocabulary is definitely improving. While I am impressed and
happy overall, I am concerned about the use of cartoons in class.


I attended Curriculum Celebration twice and enjoyed the open
form and the ability to see my child’s progress. I also want to emphasize that
the teachers are very open to discuss any issues and concerns. You also can
visit the school any time during their school hours. One more good thing is
that this school will have two Pre-K classes next year.


Overall I am very happy with my choice and my daughter is
happy as well.",5,0,0,2013-01-21T01:22:16,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

When I first heard about 60 kids per classroom, my hair stood on end: but let me assure you, the classrooms at PS 770 are immense, they are like soccer fields, and students are broken down into 3 ""houses"" of 20 kids in each house; each house with its own ""house teacher"" -- the model seems to work fine.

His teachers are amazing. The least experienced teacher has been teaching for 6 years, and most have attended prestigious schools. They are rigorously vetted and receive training at Harvard prior to the start of the school year. One of the aspects of the school that I like most is that the teachers will stay with the student through 5th grade. That means no time wasted at the beginning of the year learning routines and getting to know the students. It also means that my son's teachers will already know how best to relate to my son, who can be a bit of a handful at times.

17K770,Amanda Schulman Brokaw,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"Last year, when I was an anxious mess, trolling the Internet for decent schools, agonizing over my application lists of in-zone/out-of-zone/un-zoned schools, and losing sleep over  how I was going to find a decent Kindergarten for my son as a resident of seriously under-served District 17, I made the incredibly intelligent decision to visit PS 770.  
I arrived on a Friday morning at 10.  I was immediately struck by the bright, cheerful, window-filled rooms and the buzz of productivity in the air.  I was shown the locations of the kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade classrooms and invited to observe any and all at my leisure.  
I observed for 2 hours and during that time I was amazed to see so many children happily engaged in their work.  I never saw anyone, head on elbow, gazing out the window, in the fog of a daydream. I never saw a child looking distracted or a teacher raise their voice.  The children were all moving around the classroom, actively participating in learning.  I saw 2nd graders give oral presentations on non-fiction books that they'd been reading, with a confidence and true grasp of diction and presentation that amazed me.  I saw 1st graders constructing boats out of toothpicks and cucumbers as part of a unit on transportation.
It was when I was in the first-grade class that a little boy came up to me and said, smiling widely to reveal his missing top teeth, “Hello. Why are you visiting our school today?” When I explained that I had a son and that I was looking for a kindergarten for him and asked the boy if he thought that I should send my son to The New American Academy, he replied, “Yes! It’s the greatest school in the whole world!” After our brief exchange he went back to his cucumber project and got back to work.
What struck me about this exchange, was not the boy’s enthusiasm for the school, but the naturalness of our interaction.  I had visited numerous, very nice, schools where I saw children I had known for years, sitting quietly at their desks, facing forward as they listened closely to their lessons.  When I saw them, they would flash me a quick smile or sneak a little wave and then immediately focus back on what was being taught.  Clearly they knew that a disruption in their quiet focus was not allowed in their classroom.
My son started Kindergarten in September 2012, so I have not been a parent at P.S. 770 for very long, but I think that it is clear that he is an active participant in his school day.  And I think that because he is treated with enough respect to have a little bit of autonomy in his classroom, he feels very strongly that he would never disrupt the sanctity of it.  
I love the warmth and the celebration of exploration and knowledge that I see at the school.  And I think it is very unique.
I encourage anyone and everyone to visit and see it for themselves.",3,0,0,2012-10-18T23:44:56,1.0,0.026000000000000002,0.17600000000000002,0.04,0.335,0.095,0.425,0.026000000000000002,0.568,0.10300000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.21

17K770,Carmen Castillo-Barrett,brooklyn,Elementary,273,"Upon hearing about The New American Academy's model, I was immediately intrigued. Once I visited, I was absolutely blown away by the thoughtful execution of how to best meet children's varying needs. Although the idea of 60 students in one classroom was initially mind-boggling, the fact is that the children are very rarely taught in big groups and they are actually broken up into smaller groups, which makes for a 15:1 ratio (something unheard of in the public school system). The teachers are provided with ongoing training and support and it is quite obvious that they thoroughly enjoy their jobs and absolutely love the children. 


One of my favorite aspects of The New American Academy is the fact that the same teachers my daughter has in Kindergarten will be the same teachers all through to the 5th grade. This continuity allows for the teachers, students and their families to develop a strong, long-term relationship where a child's growth and development can be better appreciated. Another one of my favorite things about the school is the focus on a child's need to be physically active. My daughter begins her day by playing outside and doing exercise.

Starting with a principal who seldom listens to the concerns and complaints of parents. And can be rather dismissive. 
The school has a No Place for Hate/Anti bulling policy however, some teachers and staff are guilty of bulling themselves. They constantly yell at the students for the most minor infractions. Doing so in the presence of class mates, opening up said kid to be teased but their piers. Some teachers also have a habit of openly comparing the rest of the class to the A students, therefore inflating the egos of some, while simultaneously diminishing the self-esteem of others.
I also feel like they can do a much better job of informing parents of city programs available for children. There's so much other there that parents can take advantage of. 
Don't get me wrong, there are some really good, kind teachers at this school who understand the importance of their job and have a vested interest in the students success.

As a matter of fact, the current principal (Ms. Solitario) was my 3rd grade science teacher! : )       15 years later, I returned as a student-teacher and then as a regular substitute teacher for 5 years. Every moment that I spent in this school was the best years of my teaching career. Administration was always very supportive and confident in their staff. They had such a keen eye to spot great teachers which reflects the success of this school. This school works not only closely as a community but as a family and supports each other as needed. In all 3 school buildings, the staff is so goal-oriented, set high expectations for all, and keeps the students' best interest at heart. 
  The gifted and talented students in the main building and Lenox Academy were the brightest and most well-behaved students that I've every worked with. I miss everything about that school.  Although I left for a little while, I plan on returning in the near future. The most enlightening experiences of my career were all at PS 235.

I had heard nothing but good things about the school. My son came into Meyer Levin a straight A student and was unable to graduate his grades were so poor by 8th grade. The decline was gradual, but was unable to be turned around without summer school.
I thought Mr. Underwood would be an ally in assisting me with turning my son's grades around, but he seemed to perpetuate the problem. He would give me his word, and then fall back on it. I am a hands on parent very vocal and on board with my child's education. Yet no matter how many times I went up to the school I felt as though my son were under attack. I will say there were some teachers and an Assistant Principal that recognized the talent and potential in my son. However, having placed him in a class where kids were not on his academic level just seemed to pull him down.      
Behavior in this school during the day was quite surprising to me; some students were very disrespectful when spoken to by teachers in the hall. The girls with their flippant remarks, the boys with their sagging jeans it was really a sight to see.
With the help of George Leonard my son was able to redeem himself. I am just thankful the worst school experience for my son is now over. He is embarking on a new journey as a freshman in HS.

Had I been offered a job at this school, I would have not accepted the position. I was ready to walk out of the interview mid-way. The principal came off as rude, disorganized, and not knowing what she was talking about. During the interview process, the rest of the staff portrayed the student body in a horrible light. I never heard faculty members speak so poorly of their students. Having spent a considerable amount of time waiting outside the building and coming across many students participating in a recreational activity, I was shocked to hear the staff speak so poorly of children that appeared well-behaved. At the end of the interview, the entire group of highly qualified teachers being interviewed was told by the staff that they didn't feel anyone was ready to handle their students. I was greatly disturbed by my experience with this school for the staff came across as the coldest and most pessimistic I have ever encountered.",8,0,0,2011-08-24T23:25:10,0.75,0.03,0.21100000000000002,0.065,0.15,0.115,0.634,0.015,0.852,0.098,0.023,0.24

I have been going there for two years now and i have been getting the proper education so far. The teacher and staff care so much about  each student,some go above and beyond to teach us. The school offers tutor programs,lots of after school, and more curricular activities. AS a student,  i would recommend K366 ,  the school ROCKS!   

I am sorry you didn't have a positive experience while attending the group interview , but i can assure you that its the one of the best new school in canarsie .

In anything new everyone will experience """"Good"" and  ""Bad"" , but in time this school will rise and be on NY tops public middle school. As my mom would say , "" the Principal is smart and passionate about this school"" she really really cares about her work and wanting every STUDENT to achieve!!!!

Once you are on top of your child and their education and don't just sit back and expect the teachers to do everything, then you see the wonderful outcome.  In my experience with the teachers, I find that the 8th grade teachers were the absolute best, they wanted to see the kids pass, they wanted to see them progress, they wanted to see the kids succeed and do their best.  In the 3 years my daughter spent there, she did not do well on the ELA's at all.  With the help of Ms. Denis, the guidance counselor, we got her a tutor.

I was bussed to the annex i believe to be on Van Siclen Ave off Atlantic Ave. I must say, the I.Q that i have and the drive to make it more than just another statistic kid from Brooklyn all originated from those 2 buildings. From Mrs. Goodman in the 80's to Mr. Moore &amp; Mr. Tray (possibly best instructor i've ever had!) in the 90's, i learned more than just academics. I can't begin to describe my learning experiences there, but to say they will never be forgotten and i am more than greatful. I now reside in Orlando FL and am 27 yrs old. I have a 5 year old genious for a daughter and a model for a wife. I work for CVS/Caremark Corporate and am working on my associates in Business Admin, so that i may try for a Batchlor Degree in Business soon.

I would definitely recommend this school to everyone, the teachers here are very respectful and they make learning fun, the kids sometimes do get very rowdy but the teachers help everything stay in control, and everyone is so helpful. I have never suffered bulling here and I have found my group of best friends. There is a lot of diversity and I will really miss this school. It is very clean, and has a homie feeling to it, with a very panoramic view in the fourth floor. We also have a greenhouse which the younger grades visit and help take care of and also a peer mediation program where the peer mediators help students solve their problems and come to solutions. We also have a medium sized library where my love for books came from, the librarian Ms.Marla is super nice and helpful and she can recommend you any book you want. This school leaves you feeling prepared to enter the ""real world"" with inalienable experiences, knowledge, and friendships. The only thing I don't like is that this school is a participant in the Wellness in the SchoolsCook for Kids program, which replaces the traditional cafeteria menu with a healthy menu, which is very unappetizing for us but  I usually brought my own lunch.

They have a empty school yard where the children can line up by class just like they use to what going to happen come winter, snow and the rain not to mention the cold. They have to stand outside until the parent coordinator come out and tell them to go in.  That's another thing she will tell the 4-5th graders to go into the school first while the 2nd graders have to stand outside.

Or when was the last time you attended a PTA meeting,  or the 75 Precinct Council meetings to share your concerns about gang activities around the school? If you are not involved with your kids education, don't expect other parents to do so. It is your responsibility as a citizen to get involved with the community.

I was a bit worried at first as to how she would cope with a different learning environment being she was a very quiet,shy,soft spoken but very motivated . My fear quickly disappeared. Most times it's not up to teachers to guarantee that your child will perform to his/her standard or that they will learn,we all have a part to play and if we play our parts OUR CHILDREN can and will succeed. I have had no problems with my child whether disciplinary or performance. The teachers she has had from Grade 4 -5 has done a good job, I give  credit where credit is due.

The teachers try really hard but some students don't give their all and the school doesn't provide enough programs.I 'm just saying that they don't give you things that you may want or need. For example, they don't give you health classes, which I think it may come in handy or just to at least get a base off of the topic. They also don't give any classes to learn another language. I honestly think this school does nothing to solve whatever problems they have, for one, instead of giving something like ""explorers"" give us health classes, or language courses, give the students programs dealing with something career wise... Not everyone may want to have the same career, so this school should be more involved and take more interest as to what the students may like. The school should also reward the children who do very well in all classes, you cannot expect a child to constantly work. Take for example when in interviews for high schools and colleges, the student only has grades to show for themselves. The children who have good grades should also be able to become more creative and more outstanding as an individual. The number of students that roam the halls, are loud and distracting, and cause conflicts with other students should be taught more strictly because as a student that goes to this school, it doesn't seem like anything is being done to help any of these students.

This year im goin to highschool and cant wait to get out of this nightmare school. There are lots violence and fighting  everyday in that school.Their are mostly all bad kids in that school who bullies others in purpose justto get all the attention. I always wanted to know how these crazy bad kids got accepted in this school in the first place.That proves how scary and bad  this school is. I think they just accept anyone who wants to go to this school. Their are so many violence in  that school that some of them nearly died.And i think some of them  did die. Even the boys aand girls fight eachother. Their are ots of kids or teens that are injured because of violence. ...........,1,0,0,2012-08-15T14:45:24,0.75,0.243,0.278,0.065,0.312,0.243,0.8740000000000001,0.17800000000000002,0.423,0.364,0.016,0.41100000000000003

Kids were throwing baseballs in the pond thing,” said 14-year-old Anthony Price, who added he wasn’t one of the troublemakers.“They were making jokes and throwing stuff in the fountain. It didn’t seem like a big deal,” said another student, who wished to remain anonymous. In addition to the baseballs, witnesses reported seeing empty plastic soda bottles and other garbage in the water. The DOE has launched an investigation, but the News launched their own in the court of public opinion at the memorial yesterday: “That is an absolute disgrace,” said Sharon Hooks, a school teacher from Hartford visiting the site. “I don’t care if these children were too young to remember the events of that day. They need to be taught to be respectful.""",0,0,0,2012-06-24T14:50:58,0.5,0.16,0.256,0.115,0.9390000000000001,0.307,0.867,0.146,0.488,0.321,0.03,0.39899999999999997

19K404,disqus_qG39ZBjVxk,brooklyn,Middle,215,"I was a student here as a freshman from 2008-2009 and I immediately transferred to another high school because of my experience here. I would like to share it with others who are considering to attend this school, though I know that it has been many years since, it sounds like things haven't changed much. First and foremost, the teachers that taught while I was there were the best teachers I've had. They genuinely looked after the students and tried to teach the class as best as they could, it sounds like they are much different now; though the issue is the students. 
Most of the students were extremely rude to teachers and staff, they bullied and antagonized other classmates including making racist jokes to minorities, had physical and unnecessary drama amongst themselves. I was one of the few students who had high grades because I actually did the work, which was not hard nor challenging at all, (one of the reasons why I transferred). At the end of the year, people near me groaned and 'tisk-ed' at me every time I received an award for my grades, which, as others have said, causes disrespect from others to students with high grades,thus discouraging them from    excelling.
For me, the students and the level of education given at AFYW is what makes the school have a bad reputation. For the first time in my life, I honestly wanted more challenging work given to me because the education there was disbelievingly easy and laughable. By the time I transferred to my new school, I was shocked how advanced the work was and how unprepared I truly felt, but thanks to my decision to transferring, I was put into challenging AP classes the next year and I'm now into my second year of college. 
I would not recommend this school to those who want to be properly  prepared for college and want to have a good high school experience, without the endless bullying and crude jokes.",2,0,0,2013-06-05T22:37:20,1.0,0.027999999999999997,0.27399999999999997,0.013999999999999999,0.9640000000000001,0.14400000000000002,0.763,0.019,0.674,0.28800000000000003,0.005,0.315

19K404,ElevenSeven,brooklyn,Middle,215,"Please clarify your comment. It's very hard to understand. Even though they may have high graduation rates, keep in mind that the academic preparedness for college is very low. Education is a big factor of college preparedness, statistics DO matter and students, parents and teachers should care. The fact that you said that statistics should be ignored is unfortunate. Yes, people forge their paths, but keep in mind that they are students who have no clue and no direction about college and education. Also, I also hear that many students tried to transfer, but it was hard because the school lagged on getting things done. That is a red flag.

A friend of mine who graduated from AFYW told me that she had to take college courses in order to get a feel for college and a better education in all. Her mother had to pay out of pocket to help the girl. 

The person who talked about the principal gave me a clear view of what goes on in the school. Even if the principal had to leave, she should have done it ahead of time and tell the student that she couldn't do the task. Considerate people, principals who care about the welfare of their students do that. I could careless if she had something to do.

19K404,Courtney Winkfield,brooklyn,Middle,215,"I’d like to take a moment to address some of the deeply concerning comments listed below. 
 
1)      We take discipline very seriously at Young Writers with an emphasis on respect and community reparation.  We have extremely low incidents of physical fighting and hold students accountable for instances of disrespect to adults or peers.  We take all reports of a sexual nature especially seriously, following the Chancellor’s Regulations.  Visitors to our school nearly always comment on the positivity of our school tone.
2)      This year we offer different tracks for our math students at each grade level.  Students who enter Young Writers having passed the Integrated Algebra Regents exam with above a 75 may take Geometry right away.   
3)      Students at Academy for Young Writers must meet core Department of Education graduation requirements, both credits and Regents exams, in order to graduate from our high school.  We believe, and research supports the belief, that when a student struggles to capture credits in their first or second year of high school, making them repeat an entire grade dramatically increases their chances of dropping out all together. Instead, we allow students to take classes with their cohort while creating interventions to support them in recapturing missing credits.  
4)      No teacher at the Academy for Young Writers has ever taken any test for any student. This is a baseless allegation and is entirely false. 
5)      We have a strong college preparation and counseling program.  In addition to the CUNY and SUNY schools, we have several students thriving at schools like Ithaca College, Southern Vermont University and Skidmore College on full scholarships. 
We are extremely proud of the rigorous and supportive community we have built over the past 5 plus years as a school and the Department of Education has recognized our hard work.  I invite you to visit our school survey (http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2010-11/Survey_2011_K404.pdf)  – anonymous and unbiased feedback from our community of teachers, parents and students – to learn more about what our school is all about.  I also invite you to visit the school any time.

Teachers also pick favorites and force smarter kids to cater to other kids which is not fair.

58% of students believe that students at this school don't help and care about each other, and 58% percent of students also say that most students don't treat each other with respect.Also 54% of students say that most students don't treat teachers with respect.

I wish you would just LISTEN to what people are telling you, instead of pick pocketing what you want to hear. You need to keep in mind that AFYW is a minority school. Push discipline to the max, and get a stronger curriculum. Which means more AP Classes in school, college environment, no more focusing on Regents ( where 80% of kids failed the Geometry Regents) and no babying bad behaving students and disrespecting students who are well behaved, because your teachers do that ALOT. Teachers also pick favorites and force smarter kids to cater to other kids which is not fair. They force kids to hide their intelligence and bully some kids for speaking their mind (so much for ""liberal"" school).",0,0,2,2012-11-03T23:31:37,1.0,0.027999999999999997,0.27399999999999997,0.013999999999999999,0.9640000000000001,0.14400000000000002,0.763,0.019,0.674,0.28800000000000003,0.005,0.315

A PS/IS 30 parent writes, ""The teaches in my son's classes are knowledgeable, caring and respectful of students. The school communicates very well with parents, via telephone calls, sending letters home and daily emails. They don't offer a whole lot of electives, such as computers or law classes. They have daily science/health, social studies, algebra/math, and ELA. Art, Phys ED and Spanish are 1-2 per week. The school staff cares about the students. The school is really small right now, a little over 300 students. Everyone knows each other. Teachers and school staff are welcoming and know each student. I find this very important for 6-8 graders, especially for those kids who are coming from a small elementary school. The school and classes are clean, well maintained, with students' work displayed on walls. Student body in my son's class is friendly. It is a great group of multicultural population. I have not heard of bullying problems, any fights, or drugs. It is a very tightly knit school community. The homework load is manageable, although expect to do homework or 1.5-2 hours daily. The school is supposed to move into a new bigger building this coming September 2013. My son's class will have 3 Regents exams this year: Integrated Algebra, US History and Government, and Living Environment.

20K062,Unknown,brooklyn,Middle,1213,"Hello, I see the reviews bad and good well here’s both of my pros and cons of how it’s going so far being in sixth grade there. My pros are that
1- When students need help the teacher helps the student right away, and I noticed that the student got better at it.
2- THE TEACHERS ARE NOT “bad” they are Actully very nice and students respect the teachers for that.
3- As a starter I alredy feel welcome, because they treat us like they knew us when we we’re born and they have a very good personality 
4- We have a big recess yard which makes it very fun to play in and you can do so many things!
5- (not an important pro) They have vending machines and the drinks and snacks are one word AMAZING and cheap 🙂🙂🙂.

My cons
1- students were “play” fighting in the yard and none of the teachers did anything!
2- I noticed students curse out loud and never get in trouble for it I mean I do understand they did it before but that’s not good! And I will admit I have cursed but not in school!
3- (not important con) THE VENDING MACHINE DOESN’T WORK SOMETIMES.
4- They say phones aren’t allowed out yet when school starts I’m in the auditorium and I see students playing on there phones I mean I don’t if that’s breaking a rule cause class didn’t start yet.
5- When we get up to get to our class we all always squished by other grades 7th grades and 8th grades and 6th

So this are my cons (bad) and pros (good) so both sides are reasonable so my point is the schools not bad, not the best school, but it’s an Ok school a and all schools have cons and pros.",0,0,0,2018-09-15T04:59:16,0.5,0.218,0.19,0.045,0.894,0.133,0.763,0.327,0.17600000000000002,0.345,0.139,0.147

It had been just an hour since I had talked to the principal and the teacher had already been spoken to, and she had already confronted my son (in front of his friends!) and argued with him over what had happened. My son gave in and told the teacher that he must have remembered incorrectly, and came home frantic and worried and feeling sorry for the teacher. After this, we let the whole affair go. There was no point speaking to the school if this was how issues were resolved: by confront a kid and making them feel sorry for the teacher and worried for her job.

My children have
attended P.S./I.S. 104 on both the elementary and middle school levels. I have
nothing but the highest regard for the dedicated administration and staff of
this school. As a parent who is actively involved in their children’s education,
and as a former educator myself who has visited schools both good and bad
across the country, I am incredibly thankful that I can begin each day knowing
that I have sent my children off to a place where they will be safe, cared for,
and held to the highest standards of academic achievement.

She encourages her staff to be tough and keep them in line. It's no surprise to find out that she has no children of her own  it actually helps explain her treatment of the students. (Excluding the Delta ""gifted"" kids of course) The reason that Ms. DiBella and her staff are allowed to get away with this type of stuff is because there is almost zero parent involvement in the school. I would urge any parent to think twice before sending their kids to P.S. 104. It's not a good place.""</p>",0,0,0,2009-05-13T21:42:43,0.75,0.11,0.151,0.039,0.905,0.028999999999999998,0.45,0.19399999999999998,0.044000000000000004,0.256,0.47700000000000004,0.129

While this school does provide education that is leagues ahead of other schools in it's region, the area the have a VERY ACUTE lack of expertise are child counseling/social services and the commitment to do so. They instead much rather rely on a policy of punishment shaming to set the kids in line, which only works for the short term. In the long run, this can lead to the afflicted child to develop a self-depreciating and pessimistic attitude and fear of going to school in general. Another thing that often goes under the radar is that the Teachers here are HIGHLY biased against children they perceive as troublemakers whether that is true or not. I was a former student here and I came on the receiving end of that policy. To this day in high school I am still dealing with the after-effects of my time here in this school and the lack of proper counseling measures really make me question do they actually even care about children (ages 5-10 NO LESS) who are prone to being mentally disturbed (bullying, exclusion, depression ETC). Granted this was way back in 2012 and the staff or policies may have changed but I recommend that if your child is the type to need counseling and social support, I highly dissuade you from sending your child here.",0,0,0,2020-01-14T19:50:43,1.0,0.445,0.076,0.001,0.9540000000000001,0.035,0.8809999999999999,0.919,0.004,0.047,0.03,0.03

The reason why I say this is because the teachers are not teaching. Every class the Social Studies teacher has the students read the textbook by themselves and then answer the questions with their partners while she's busy on her computer. If they can't finish the work they bring home to finish it. Every test is either in class open book test or take home. As for the science teacher,very often he goes to the bathroom twice during one period. My child never needs to study for the tests. The tests are just copying the material from the book and move it over to the test paper. Same thing with the science teacher. Lately (soon after the Statewide Exams are over), the ELA teacher had the students read the booklet and answer the questions with their partners while she's on her computer as usual. Oh, I forgot to mention the ELA teacher teaches ELA and Social Studies while the Math teacher teaches Math and science. There are only two classes in 6th grade not including the special ed and these two teachers teaches both classes. SO, you child is doomed.

The children feel this and know the teachers and administrators care for them too.  The well balanced diversity (the school has 4-5 official languages including Bengali and Arabic) which means that every child feels included and special.  Differences are celebrated and welcome.  Ms. Steinberg is masterful at recruiting only the best teachers and keeping some traditional, yet welcome things like school uniforms and good attendance certificates.  Importantly, the school is small enough (compared to other elementary schools) so that needs of parents are addressed without too much formality. The school has amazing extracurricular programs/features that many schools do not have the funding to have such as a beautiful library with school librarian, a state of the art computer lab with Apple computers, both science AND STEAM classes, music, gym, art and others.  The PTA can use more parent involvement but has come a long way considering that the PTA was only formed a couple years ago.  Many of the families have 2 working parents so engaging them can present challenges and the strong work ethic directly shows in the classroom and school.

which was funny because I was on the list for Valedictorian candidates.... but seriously, they made my life hell. 
And during my last year of school, I was also a monitor and tutor, monitor for my old teachers because Ms. K IS DA BEST TEACHER EVER. So is Ms. Bensimon (homeroom and chorus teacher). I tutored because I saw some students doing bad (I always got 3s until they took the listening section out of the state exams) and wanted to help.
The thing I am getting at is that I maintained nice relationships with all of my tutor peers and believe me when I am saying this, they told me about all the terrible things that happened since I graduated in 2012.
I was one of the only 2 students that got the IS. 187 (christa mcAuliffe) so the ride was pretty short, but I came in on a visitng day and everything changed. 
They made the whole system more middle school like, and those that were in 5/4 grade were pretty much completley destroyed.

The Regents class is supposedly open to 'the 30 highest average 7th graders' but was chosen (in 2014/2015, at least) by who was the teacher's favorite. For example, students with 96s weren't getting in while 89s were, including students with lower conduct than others and lower state assessment scores.  The Regents teacher also lied about the selection, guaranteeing placement to whomever she 'liked' and then, when the placement was done, she defended with 'I had nothing to do with the placement'.    As well as favoritism in that, teachers only select certain students (usually their class favorite) to be part of school events (the ribbon cutting ceremony, enrichment, monitoring) and give extra credit for no reason. The teachers at this school, as well, lack patience and often do not grade assignments but rather grade solely on, once more, favoritism. Also, whenever a student protests something formally (not rudely or by confrontation) they are immediately lectured and reprimanded.  When a parent or guardian contacts an assistant principal, they literally respond with, 'please do not bring this up again.

20K180,Disgusted Mother,brooklyn,K-8,1060,"I am no longer feeling the same about this school as I once did.  First and foremost, the school is ill equipped to handle the JHS population.  The lack of enough lockers have children wandering from class to class carrying backpacks that are just way toooooo heavy for them to carry.  Engrade is a system that is widely used in this school  which enables teachers to list the grades of students and all of the homework and projects that are either complete or incomplete.  My son is in 6th grade and I can tell you that only the Science teacher Mr. Amato, and the Math teacher, Mr. Xia use this system faithfully.  The rest of the teachers which include Mrs. DiClementi, Mrs. Quintana, and Ms. Holcomb do not.  So as a parent I am left wondering what my child's grades are and what assignments are due.  I am also not a big fan of allowing the children to do their homework while in class. Which many teachers seem to allow.  What's being taught in class if you are allowing the children to complete their homework in class?  Also, nepotism runs rampant in this school.  Many staff members have either their own children, or their siblings that attend this school along with some of their personal friend's children.  These children whom everyone knows in the building are the ""chosen ones"" who are allowed to participate in all of the activities that many other children are not chosen for strictly because they are affiliated with these certain teachers Mrs. P, Mrs. Q, and Miss. V. in particular.  These ""chosen children"" are the ones that participate in the Color Guard, Violin concerts (both Spring and Winter regardless of their playing skill) take first place in Science Fairs year after year, and win a seat in the studen government, etc...  It really sends a poor message that it doesn't matter what you do, whether academically or musically, you will not be chosen because you are not within the ""chosen crowd."" The Principal really needs to take a look at what's going on and  bring this school back to a place where students enjoy attending and are treated fairly across the board.  Looking back now I am so sorry that I allowed my child to stay in this school.  I really should have entertained the idea of attending another Middle School.  The SeeAll Academy has left a really sour taste in my mouth.",11,0,0,2012-03-26T15:13:18,0.75,0.292,0.156,0.032,0.958,0.053,0.7290000000000001,0.445,0.015,0.284,0.242,0.081

Although each Academy has different electives, the core subjects are the same.

20K187,Just want to say something,brooklyn,Middle,953,"I am kind of disappointed in this school and can't wait for my kid to finish the last year there. The school should appreciate the heavy population of Asian students and their parents. It wouldn't be able to keep good grades and high ranking without those kids' great contribution on extra studies and homework from private classes after school and on the weekends. Not from the teachers, period. I don't think most of them are good educators. The English curriculum has never really worked out. To my kid’s academy, for example, during the last two years, if without some serious writing homework from one of the teachers (non-ELA subject), I don’t think those kids could write anything good after middle school.
The most unpleasant thing about this school is that the attitude from some of the teachers, including the administration is unacceptable. They prefer to simply send the students to the administration office without caring to talk to them. If you want your kid be treated as a kindergardener, be quiet, and listen and follow,  then this is the right school for them.

After sneaking a peek at my class' overall score (in the Scientific Academy, which has been rumored as the hardest academy- it is actually way easier than expected), many people got 4s, but if you get high 3s (such as a 3.8, which is the most minimum), and decent report card grades, and satisfactory attendance (as required by the New York State, at least a 90% attendance for promotion), you can guarantee a spot in the school.


Also, according to schooldigger.com, The Christa McAuliffe School has been ranked as #1 in the entire New York State. The Anderson School, the known gifted and talented school, is now number 2. Be proud.


Lastly, please do not ask about what is the minimal state test score is. There is NO SET NUMBER. The staff at the school DO NOT know what is the minimum. They receive a list from the Board of Education and go from there. If you have any questions, ask the Board. THE SCHOOL WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISCONCEPTIONS, SO DEAL WITH IT.


Thank you, and good luck!


P.S. Answering Sophie Lin's questions, there are no such thing as 757s. There are 343s (4.00), 402s, (4.50), and 360s (4.09), etc. If you are talking about the combined scores, they would not do the total score, for God's sake. They would do each one separately, find the overall percentile you rank, and there you go on priority listing. (BTW, 757 combined is about a 379 per subject. Again, you might get a 2 and a 4 and that is how you got the 757. That is why they don't do the scores combined.)


P.P.S. SCIENCE STATE TEST SCORES DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING FOR ANY OF THE ACADEMIES. THEY DID IT FOR THE SAKE OF 8TH GRADE HIGH SCHOOL PLACEMENT, BUT DON'T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.

I freakin go to this school for a while now. Some teachers will just give you work without teaching you. They are so lazy. They just tell us to do stuff that won’t even benefit us. They will tell us to not worry about something and the next day, they will say “You gotta write a  draft essay and type it.” Now, everyone rushes to do a long essay. Some friends even told me they stayed up to 3AM, and you know what they say? Oh, I’ll collect it next week. Few teachers are raciest. One stereotyped that Asians read crapppy comics called mangas. Another was a rumor. A teacher was fat shaming and thought the Asians were the one causing trouble.                                                 But I do think dyker is good for some reasons. The band program is really good. The performances are excellent. The teacher is really nice. He gives the best candies and makes the best jokes. But if you suck, then good luck. Dyker really pushes the people who have band. They have high expectations. Fortunately, the students won’t have to spend hundreds to buy their own instruments. They lend it to the students. They do have to pay 30 dollars at the beginning of each year no matter what instrument you play. They get to keep their mouth pieces (which are given in 6th grade and expected to be well kept and last until graduation). Drum players get to keep their drumsticks. The teacher will point out the smallest mistakes. The results were worth it. The performances are all excellent. But ony 651 and 653 have band. Band is taken for 3 years for the students that are in those classes. But if you are not in those classes, you can go to afternoon band, consisting on students from 6th to 8th grade who stay afterschool for band. They are the ones that perform. But you have to have more experience than the average band student. Extra credit is given. If You don’t completely suck, you will get a 100% average only for the students that are in 51 and 53. You will usually have 3 to 4 days a week where you have band. Sometimes, you get to miss class especially towards the end of the school year when graduation practice takes place.

The teachers -- at least in the Superindendent's Program -- are mostly skilled
and caring. They are, however, not at all shy about putting intense performance
pressure on the kids. particularly at the beginning of 6th grade.
Extracurriculars are virtually non-existent. If you're not in band or drama as
part of your academic program, there's scant to no opportunity to participate
otherwise. There were pretty much no after school programs until the winter,
and then they were few and with limited enrollment. Oh -- and its location is
difficult: more than a mile to the nearest subway. In general, it's a big

20K201,Guest,brooklyn,Middle,1651,"       I just left Dyker last june and now im in high school and all I want is to go back to Dyker. It was really an amazing experience that i will never forget. In 6th grade it was a pretty hard transition going from elementary school to junior high school, starting to take a language, and having different classes like drama, art, vocal/chorus and band. I was an the SP class for all 3 years and it was great. In 7th grade the school had every student in the SP and SM classes take every class there was so we can be open to things when it came to high school. We took our regular classes, our language, physical education and then we had to take two out of the three (drama, art, vocal) that we haven't already taken in 6th grade. In 6th grade I had drama, so in 7th grade they gave me art and vocal. We still had the same day and schedule except some days that we didn't have gym we would have one of those classes and vice versa. Out of all the years 8th grade really had to be the best. When you hear the saying ""i saved the best for last"" it really was true in Dyker. 8th grade had THE BEST teachers, the best activities, probably the most work but you got rewarded for it. There were dances, the senior trip, field day, you literally ruled the school, you knew all the teachers and almost everyone else in the school and you took high school level classes. I took the earth science regents and now I started high school with 2 credits already thanks to dyker. Also if you're in the vocal program, for any grade, you have performances every marking period at school and when i was in 7th grade we even performed in Carnegie Hall which was amazing. If your in the play, there's a big play for all grades every spring and it's really fun. If your in the band they have performances all the time with the chorus(vocal class) and also perform at hotels, other schools, other graduations, our graduation, the open house and much more. And if you enjoy art there's the Halloween window painting contest, for the play the artists of the school create the scenery and backgrounds and much more.
           Back to the teachers, they really wanted you to learn and wanted to help you. They were always there for you and wanted you to do well and see you succeed which is a really big part of education, if you have no support and motivation, why do it? But the teachers here know what their teaching and tell it almost like a story and not right out of a textbook because they're doing what they love and aren't just there to get paid.
            If you're reading this and looking to go to dyker heights junior high, i highly recommend it & guarantee you will have an amazing 3 year journey.  ",1,0,0,2011-10-22T00:53:32,0.75,0.098,0.134,0.039,0.888,0.039,0.5660000000000001,0.545,0.005,0.16,0.28800000000000003,0.07400000000000001

20K201,Ryan,brooklyn,Middle,1651," I am currently an 8th grader at Dyker. My experience here has been somewhat neutral. I have been in the SM (Science & Math) program ever since I began my academic journey at the school. It may be due to my strict and overbearing teachers (more on them later), but on some nights I will easily stay up past dinner time completing homework and studying for upcoming tests. On very harsh days, there have been four tests the next day and an equal amount of homework assignments from each class. In addition, each homework assignment takes me roughly 30 minutes to almost an hour, depending on the rigor of the assignment. In the 8th grade, I have only encountered two days in which my class was not given any homework what so ever: the days before books one and two of the NYS ELA exam. I'm not sure what Solaris Zabinska is talking about when she claims she only receives homework two days a week. Perhaps it is the fact that she is in the SP program, which is not as rigorous as SM.

The description of the school is highly outdated. We do have somewhat of a law curriculum established at the school, but I wouldn't exactly call it ""law."" This magnet ""law"" program only occurs over one week, and involves students basically yelling across the room at each other over a case. There is **ONE** mock trial done for this ""law"" program, which Inside Schools exaggerates. Most of the time, however, the teachers are lecturing about law, forcing us to copy down notes. 

The architecture program at the school is nothing to come to Dyker for. It simply consists of 6th grade science teachers devoting a month or so for students to work on a project in which we build a structure following a certain theme. Nonetheless, it was certainly one of my best academic experiences at Dyker. I wish they would repeat it in the 7th and 8th grade.

About the teachers...oh the teachers. It ultimately depends on who you have for a teacher that will determine your overall learning experience in that subject. One teacher this year seemed **VERY** devoted in teaching her subject (will not mention names due to privacy). Unlike other teachers in the building, she seemed to genuinely enjoy what she was doing. She really has inspired me in many aspects that other teachers cannot match with. On the contrary, there are other teachers who are dictatorial and make class seem like a prison cell. I hate to say this, but there is most certainly favoritism with teachers. These are the students that don't have to earn their grades the hard way.

There are some experiences at Dyker I would like to keep. A few being the Shakespeare Festival, the school plays, the dances, the trips, the learning done in some classrooms, and the art instruction. 

And also, if you complain about the lunch, there's nothing a student can do about it because Dyker is a NYC **public** school. As a result, the city provides the food frozen to each school. It may not be the most appealing or appetizing meal, but it is food. And I highly doubt the lunches are expired because the NYC Department of Education would be breaking the law (I believe) by feeding us expired, potentially dangerous food. ",5,0,0,2011-05-18T00:19:04,0.75,0.098,0.134,0.039,0.888,0.039,0.5660000000000001,0.545,0.005,0.16,0.28800000000000003,0.07400000000000001

Every school in Brooklyn has its share of underprivileged and immigrant kids who do not get exposed to computers, art, and extracurrila activities through their families. So I.S. 201 does leave these children behind?  Why do schools of less fame offer these programs universally? It is scary to think that this school may have deliberately chosen not to practice the No Child Left Behind philosophyand by that, we shouldn't focus on the three R's only.

Dyker offers language, computer, music, art and drama for children that are doing well academically and are in Superintendent and SP. These children can handle the work load because they do not need extra help in their main subjects. Even with budget cuts, this school still has after school programs for all children to attend that need help in their subjects and they have the CHAMPS program. My husband and I think the teachers and staff at Dyker do a good job with the little they are given.

Currently there are difficulties with our 3rd grade class. Difficulties are in terms of communication from teacher to students. Students all stare at a 4'x3' smart board on a daily basis and come back with partial information about homework, exams, new site words, etc. Teacher refuses to use the PS204 website to post homework. If the use of a 4'x3' smart board is for the better of the students, then why not use the website to post all homework and relevant information? We're in communications with all the parents in the class and we are gathering puzzle pieces in order to find out half of what's going on in class. Since the beginning of the year we have spoken with the teacher, administration, vice principle, and all have oppose of the use of website. Why are they holding the parents back when we want to be involve and yet the the principle is completely unreachable because the administration would not let us speak with her. Principal - Mrs. N. Tomasuolo, if you are reading this, please give reach out to me. I may not be speaking for all the parents in the class, we definitely have 10 parents who would love to see some changes for the better. We understand that kids should have responsibilities as well for getting the information, but if the whole class is having trouble following the work and the parents have no idea what to work on with them. Isn't it time for the process to be changed by even just a step forward?

Pre-K and Kindergarden has been a blessing. They have multiple programs and workshops for kids. They are interactive with kids and have been a great encouragement for my little one. The teachers that are in the class are always flexible with the kids and encourage their creativity to expand. My kid loves her class and classmates. Her teachers always compliments her for the creativity and work that she has done. The class gets rewarded for participating and toys are given as a reward. I feel like this process has open my eyes on how compliments and encouragements can do wonders for little ones.",4,0,0,2018-11-23T16:26:15,1.0,0.14,0.174,0.063,0.932,0.027999999999999997,0.561,0.532,0.004,0.18899999999999997,0.268,0.08

Three of the worst abusers were Ms. Starobin, Ms. Shelse and Ms. Scala. They are the reasons I went to college for Childhood Education, to become a teacher the exact opposite of how they were. I guess I should thank them for the motivation. Ms. Starobin would throw chalk at students, insult them and encourage other students to make fun of her targets. Ms. Shelse would pick favorites and demean students having a hard time. Ms. Scala would yell at students like a drill sergeant (but worse) for the simple act of forgetting to bring something to class.

Everyone who took the Regents passed, 95% got 85% or higher on regents I believe. You just have to act proper I mean, the school is not bad if you students are nice. So if you care, and talk to your teacher they will assist you. For instance, Mr. Rios and Mr. Anderson has morning programs for extra help for the Regents, and after school helps from Mrs. Cercotto for Math regents or Mrs. Baldassano for Spanish Regent. This school also offers SHSAT tutoring, most kid who did it got a specialized high school offer.",0,0,0,2019-09-12T02:26:56,0.25,0.32299999999999995,0.162,0.045,0.8320000000000001,0.09699999999999999,0.821,0.502,0.013000000000000001,0.426,0.055,0.09300000000000001

20K220,Craft,brooklyn,Middle,1521,"I have just graduated from I.S.220 with high honors and was one of the two people who got into Stuyvesant. Honestly, this school sucks so bad, it's a joke. Out of the many kids that graduated, approximately 10 kids (should be a little less than that) received admission into a specialized high school, that's not the worst part, the teachers don't give the attention needed to failing students, they just spoon feed us the information, they act like they care, but yet they don't (this does not apply for EVERY teacher)My class ( I can't say from the others but I'm sure it wasn't only my class) was, how can I say, lustful. This guy who got a 1 on the math state test, instead of actually realizing he's failing school and should help his grades, just disturbs the class with sexual noises with others laughing and joining him hoping to drag everyone else down with him. I barely saw the principal in my 3 years of attending this school, less than 10 times I guess? It was like the assistant principals did everything. I appreciate the dean's help on trying to discipline students when they do wrong, but she does it the wrong way. She instills fear into them hoping they would do right instead of just asking the guidance counselor for help, not like the guidance counselor does much either. We had no recreational activities to interest us to learn, no field trips (like BARELY), my class personally never had any field trips except something like six flags when we were graduating. In 6th grade our English teacher just made us feel bad she didn't take us to the aquarium and mocked us because we were talkative, like hell, she put it in our faces for a whole week before she went. There were some memorable teachers, but I do not prefer their teaching, for example, in 6th grade, our Social Studies teacher let us play on the laptop for the last 2 months before summer instead of actually learning something useful. Sure, I might have enjoyed it at the time, but I still don't agree with what he did.The atmosphere is also intense, we have certain kids trying to pick fights with others and we have others who were extremely invective. We had our 8th grade English teacher saying that 10 years ago, it was way worse, but it still is. I almost had to ask my parents to call 311 because my class and several others stayed in the auditorium because some of us kept talking and by the time we got to eat, we had 2-5 minutes to eat, which is barely enough time to have a proper lunch, which I can personally say doesn't feel legal to me, nonetheless the fact that our grade was the last grade to eat lunch, so we were hungry enough. I mean I was fully aware that some people in my class were failing some subjects in school, I was also fully aware that if I knew, I'm pretty sure that the teacher could figure it out too considering she has all the test scores and etc. And yet we were denied any REAL help with issue we have in mind. Hell, in 8th grade, I have to say my math teacher was a nice person, in times, but I felt like screaming at times when she threatened to call my parents for using the word ""Hate"" in her class in the context of hating group work, because at times my group was full of slackers. The ONLY, AND I MEAN ONLY, memorable teacher I had if anyone was my 7th grade math teacher, who at the time when he became my math teacher was his first year teaching, and you know what most of my class mates did? They exploited that fact, and talked all year long and misbehaved when he tried his best to help them excel in their work.
I know this school is one of the many that are not the worst, but I truly hated this school with all my heart, I liked some of my friends that I made but if I ever came back to this 3 years worth of memory in my life, I would not enjoy recalling it.",1,1,0,2014-08-16T22:52:12,0.25,0.32299999999999995,0.162,0.045,0.8320000000000001,0.09699999999999999,0.821,0.502,0.013000000000000001,0.426,0.055,0.09300000000000001

The teachers I had were great and have helped me grow as a person, but the other staff and students are what ruin this school. The hallways are always a congregation of kids  standing in the middle of a hallway cursing and being rude, half the kids at the school don't even speak English which is very frustrating when you have to ask them to move out the way. The deans at the school don't know how to disciple the students and always overreact. For example every time a student comes to school late even if they were 3 mins late or 3 hours late they would get detention which is very embarrassing because you have to sit up front of the auditorium and eat last and to make it worst you have to sit at a certain table during lunch. The guidance counselors are the worst, they don't act in a professionally manner and are never there when I needed help.

I met a lot of new people and I learned a lot of new things. This school wasn't as bad as people said it was. There might not be much smart people in this school but there are smart ones. People shouldn't hate this school honestly and most teachers don't care about the students and disrespect us. Some are even biased, but there are also the ones who aren't bad. It really isn't fair. But the students there aren't so respectful and kind either. I had this 8th grader come up to me and threatened me last year. She said, ""Why you staring at my friend like a ***** for?"" Honestly, I wasn't staring at her at all. I was just talking and laughing with my best friend. She wanted to fight with me and I just said, ""Well then, sorry but I really didn't look at her."" They left and laughed. I wanted to tell the school about it, but I thought I had no proof but I had at least 3 of my friends who were there to witness this but I didn't tell the teachers. But if there are bullies, I'm sure there is someone in the school that can help with this. There's this anger problem classmate and there was someone helping him. There are also many racist students in the school. They would say ""CHINOO!!"" in the hallways. Also, the teachers don't make class fun, Which is the reason why most kids fall asleep. I honestly think only the Science teachers, Mrs. Vesterman(A LA teacher), and Mr. Mosher (A Art Teacher) are interesting and makes the class fun.

yeah, it would be strong if they hadn't decided to up and remove the visual arts program from the eighth grade. even though every classroom is equipped with a smartboard, most of them are old and worn, flickering between being barely alive to shutting down completely. the staff is mostly nice, i'll give you that, but some just don't seem equipped to work with kids. i'll give you the full rundown of this place.

now, i've only been in the delta program 6th, 7th, and 8th, so my knowledge is limited to that section. what i can tell you though, is that they have higher standards for delta than the other classes. they'll say to the delta kids, ""oh, you should be better behaved and participate more because you're DELTA.""
just because.
the only reason that they can give us.
is that we're ""'delta"""".

completely insane, considering that the only thing changed about delta's curriculum from the original curriculum is that we go a wee bit faster and we learn algebra before the other classes.
woah. such a big difference.

with the classes, they sometimes grow to become cliques, and then there's little cliques in the class clique and uGH you get it. the 6th and 7th grade girls seem more like stereotypes of what people think high school teens are like. i'm talking instagram, tons and tONS of makeup, gathering in the bathroom, the whole ""becky you can't sit with uS"" cliche, jesus there's a lot of cliques, seRIAL DATERS (think about this. think very hard about an 11 year old having 5 boyfriends in a week and flaunting her nonexistent boobs everywhere. ew.)
i just don't like it.

i naturally have a lot of spite and pettiness bottled up within me, being the ~angsty~ teen that i am, but nobody has aggravated my petty side like mrs. vinciguerra, the 7th to 8th grade english teacher. she is the Worst(TM). she's gotten fired two times, eats her stupid salad in front of the class while simultaneously scolding us for eating, chides us for having a pack of gum on us and then asks for a piece of said gum, and on her instagram (which is public, mind you, i'm not actively stalking her), she does pole dancing. also, my parents (and a few others) thought she was high at the parent teacher conference. i wouldn't be surprised if she was.
wow. what a great teacher. let your kids follow her example.

aaand there's mrs. mejia, the spanish teacher. she's very loud, and her eyebrows are obviously drawn on. she also gives a lot of homework, but it doesn't really matter in the long run if you do it or not. other than that, i have no comments on her, except that a lot of people don't pay attention in her class.
including me.
what can i say, spanish makes me doze off.

mr. rosenberg (7th-8th grade) and mr. g (7th grade) are both great social studies teachers, no complaints there. though, mr. rosenberg is a bit eccentric, but he gives cool projects like going on strike and making pop art pieces. mr.g is also an ela teacher apparently, but i've never had him for ela.

mr. lovell, the science teacher for 7th grade, is chill as well, and (7th and 8th teacher) mrs. zhang's accent makes for some hilarious mispronounciations of certain names. mrs. zhang gives fairly light homework, and if you read the textbook you should be fine. she constantly reminds the class about how she doesn't need to be likeable in order to be a good teacher, which is a bit annoyingly repetitive of her.

mr. sherman, the 7th grade math teacher, is a wacky dude who tries a little bit too hard to be the ""cool"" teacher. he calls the class ""shermanland"" and his ""day without math"" project is extremely repetitive. also, lots of homework, oops. mrs. caban, eighth grade teacher, is really mellow. she gives us a break in between double periods, and she jokes around a little bit too. homework load is average.

mr. kelly, the PE and health teacher, is really adamant about us not sitting on the bleachers in PE for some reason. there's always a few giggles when he brings up condoms and intercourse in health, but he lets it slide.

mrs. oppel, the music teacher, is the type of teacher who will assign you so. many. projects. oh lordy, she's got a load of projects for you, but only some of them get finished. she also runs band.

oh uhhh, i think that's it for the teachers. if you have any questions or additions to this, comment them.",0,0,0,2017-11-27T03:23:46,0.75,0.12300000000000001,0.149,0.053,0.907,0.028999999999999998,0.405,0.604,0.019,0.12,0.24600000000000002,0.08800000000000001

I must be the insane parent who they are all speaking of.  Facts: twice my son was abused/bullied and the school did nothing.  In 6th grade he was pantsed  (his underwear and pants were pulled down in class) and his entire lower body exposed!  Guess what the principal did? NOTHING!  

Then a few months later the same bullies brought in photos of guns and told my son they had guns under their parents beds and were going to kill him!  I requested a meeting with the parents Zappulla said NO!!!!! 

AGAIN guess what Zappulla did???? NOTHING!  I called the cops.  I am not going to let my child get bullied.

I also called the superintendents office where Mitch of the superintendents office stated to me ""are you done with your rant?"".  I said when the Daily News learns of this Mitch are you sure thats your reply and his attitude quickly changed.

The story we hear from the dean's office is that troubled children need ""love and understanding"" rather than punishment. What's even worse is that the deans have turned their office into a lounge of sorts, where the problem kids get to hang out, have pizza parties, go on to Youtube and play cards. The worst kids in the school are being treated like kings and queens, not having to go to classes or do work. They tell their teachers to f*** off.

The teachers made it very clear that 7th grade was the year in which your grades mattered the most. I tried so hard to get good grades and i'm very disappointed that I only got a 97.92 for my overall average for the year but I still think It's certainly enough to work with. I had a few meltdowns where I cried myself to sleep because I got a grade lower than a 90, but besides that 7th grade was fun and challenging. I was able to move up to an honors class and will now be in the virtual enterprise program once 8th grade starts. My opinion that this is a great school and the fact that I would recommend it to anyone has not changed. But I cannot stress enough that my own mental state during 7th grade was not a byproduct of the teachers. It was my own perfectionist and stubborn nature which led to the crippling anxiety and stress I felt. I know many other people who were able to get averages which were 90 and above, which handled the situation a lot better than I did . After my one week break I will start studying for the SHSAT and Bard entrance exam. I know i'll try even harder next year to get VERY high grades because i'll be attempting to be valedictorian.

Those who use roller backpacks.....may have troubles with the staircase and some ""people"" don't really like those backpacks. Also, I am in the superintended program and I would say that I am not the smartest but there are a few classmates that really don't belong there.

We want situations to be handled considerately and accordingly. To ask why this situation is happening. To help the victim and then ask the culprit if something is going on that’s resulting in their actions and to help them in order to prevent this child from repeating bad behavior and getting worse, so that they learn to do better through proper/appropriate guidance (according to the situation), and punishment. That’s what we want. Especially when the complaints are the same after all these years.

20K609,Annebelle,brooklyn,Middle,222,"This school is very racist and very incompetitive. All students receive 99 averages due to the poor design of the curriculum. Half of the kids don't speak proper english and I was among the first of classes. Most parents send their daughters by force to this school, due to the fact it is all-girls. I was a former student who attended this school but now I attend a much more rigorous high school. I was left behind in my academics and high school was difficult for me. My average changed from 97 (without trying in middle school) to an 80 (with so much effort in high school). Teachers come and go whenever they want and there is no basis or structure for anything.  Three teachers in my grade left in one school year, causing us to be unable to take certain regents. Parents believe that just because their child's average is high, their child is trying. This is not the case. The school is very easy academically. Most of the students are very rude, racist and bullying is a common theme for this school. There is no criminal justice theme. The principal, Ms. Mariela Graham is trying her best.  She has a 'tough crowd' of students as well as uneducated parents who argue fo everything. Honestly, I do not blame her at all. As a parent, you should actually visit during school hours and travel around every class. The students will not be affected by an adult and will continue their rude manner, as usual. You should check the standarized test results and look beyond what you are being told. You should ask someone who has survived three years of endless chaos. I do not recommend this school at all if you expect a bright future and a good college for your child.

Ms. Annio and her team is great and their main focus is the children.  The teachers are truly putting the children first and they care about their academic performance as well as their emotional growth.  With very limited resources, they provided a lot of activities for the children.  Just in Oct/Nov 2010, we had literacy night, pumpkin patch/fall festival, thanksgiving events and class trips, just like any schools.  The school also found ways for our children to give back to our communities: Penny harvest and food drive.  At the same time, the school also encourages parent involvements and I am impressed at how involved the parents are.  We can discuss what we think with Ms. Annio freely, just like a family.  She responded to our e-mails and requests since the G&amp;T enrollment period in April 2010.  We continued to e-mail her throughout summer and she responded to us.  I can see that she is dedicated to the school and the children, so are the teachers and staff.  Everyone works hard for the children and my child loves to be part of PS 748.

20K971,Christina Howard-Lopez,brooklyn,Elementary,343,"My son was the first graduating class at P.S. 971. He just graduated a few days ago from the 5th grade. My whole experience from K-5 had it ups and downs. My son is currently reading in a 7 grade level. I love how my son is so advance in all of his classes. When the school first opened up on 2010 it was a rocky start very unorganized and no communication from staff most of the time. But as the years went by the school did improved but can do better.. The teachers was excellent. The principal I liked she was always interacting with the students. My son cried during graduation that is how much he will miss her and staff. I m not a fan of the A.P. Her attitude is very nasty at times. 
During the graduation it was so unorganized, parents didn't know what side to enter thru,
So many many parents including my self worked around telecommunications HS 3 or 4 times until one of the staff members lead us to the correct entrance. The ceremony was beautiful and very very unique I loved it.. 
But what upset me was the fact that students and parents was promise to receive a yearbook that was a part of the senior dues fees but the students never received one because it was not ready.. We are currently waiting for the school to mail it to us.

Overall I loved the education my son received during the 6 years in PS 971. But the school still needs to work on communication, and need to be more organized. ",1,0,0,2016-07-09T01:25:36,0.75,0.434,0.155,0.006,0.937,0.07,0.764,0.44299999999999995,0.009000000000000001,0.449,0.096,0.113

Yes, at first, the school seemed a bit disorganized, but you have to remember, the teachers and students were new to the building, procedures within the building were new, and in many cases not even created yet. Yes, there were the basic policies and procedures afforded to any school within the DOE, however, there are many site specific policies that needed to be created as the need arose. I can say, as a parent, and as the PTA president, I am truly proud of the staff at PS 971 for getting things together so quickly. If you remember at the beginning of the school year, the construction workers were still working on various aspects of the structure while Ms. Ruth and staff were trying to conduct classes. Not a simple task when working with 4 and 5 year olds who are naturally curious about their surroundings. The school is still learning it's role in the community, as does any new neighbor. Give them time... from what I've seen so far, things have improved drastically and they will continue to enhance their programming and community involvement! Way to go PS 971!

Here's what the newspaper said about her: ""Born and raised in Bay Ridge, Janet always aspired to be a teacher. Some of her earliest sparks of inspiration came from the elementary school teachers she had as a student at St. Patrick’s Catholic School in Bay Ridge. Janet fulfilled her goal of becoming a teacher immediately after graduating from State University of New York Buffalo with her bachelor’s degree in Education, when she landed a job as a third-grade teacher at Public School 9 in Prospect Heights. While teaching there, Janet earned her master’s as a reading teacher and reading specialist for corrective reading at Hunter College.

""Janet then became a teacher of Public School 13 in Rosebank, Staten Island. On the Rock, Janet was a classroom teacher, reading teacher, and literacy coach. With the support of her family, mentors and school administrators, Janet aspired to become a school leader and received her advanced post-master’s degree in school leadership from the College of Staten Island. She then became the assistant principal of Public School 13 for four and a half years.

""In January 2011, Janet was named principal of Public School 95. For the past four years, Janet has proudly worked side-by-side with the dedicated and hard working assistant principals, teachers, staff, PTA, parents, and students of the Public School 95 community. As a result, Public School 95 has shown academic gains in both reading and mathematics. Together, they continue to build a collaborative professional learning community, committed to providing a rigorous and supportive learning environment for all of the 1,000 students that the school serves.""",0,0,0,2016-06-04T03:20:53,1.0,0.139,0.18,0.052000000000000005,0.9009999999999999,0.044000000000000004,0.7090000000000001,0.364,0.075,0.33299999999999996,0.223,0.16

This school isn't worth coming to unless your mom's on the PTA. Otherwise, they look at you like your dirt, and treat you like dirt. They never take you seriously, they never help your bullying/everyday problems, the kids are plain rude, and the only way to be taken seriously in this school (besides your mom being on the PTA) is by making your parent call up the school all the time complaining. Yes, they'll see you as annoying, but at least you won't get pushed aside.

OH and the FAVORITISM!! If a child is funny and jokes around with outgoing teachers, the teachers look at them like good and their favorite kids, and target other kids to be nasty too. It's true, I see it happen with my own eyes to other kids & ME. Even good kids are ignored. Oh my god I had a sub who actually laughed along when kids made fun of me. SHE ENCOURAGED THIS!!! Those kids jump around & throw things, but if I talk my parent gets called???

My parents were immigrants to America as were many other kid's parents.
Most of us used Seth Low to learn enough to go to High Schhol (Lafayette, in my case,) and then go to Brooklyn Colllege which was free at the time.
The New York City school system gave us the opportunity to get into the middle class and feel good about ourselves.I don't remember any mean teachers. Most were good professionals who cared about us. 
I still rmember our Music teacher, Ms. Luni who taght us the music from The musical ""The Red Mill,""  I can still sing some of the songs) and Mr. Gordon, our History teacher, who taught us about politics and what was behind the scenes, and not reported in the news. Mrs. Pacini and Mr. levi who taught us French. Mrs. Gordon who taught Social Studies.
I suspect that none of these teachers is still alive but the legacy they have left us is still with me and my calssmates.
Some of the things we learened have now been passed onto our kids and grandkids. So, the good that they did is still with us.
I hope that there are still some students who are having the same sort of experience at Seth Low now, that I had so many years ago.

You don't have to stress that much (unless you're in a regents class in 8th grade, then the stressing might come a little but that's it). The teachers are absolutely wonderful and will make this building feel like a home away from home. I graduated this year and I'm devastated that I have to leave! If you got accepted into Bay, just have fun! The best advice anyone can give is do all your homework, study for tests, be respectful, and you'll have a perfect experience. A little shout-out to the science and computer math departments, you guys were my favorite! <3",0,0,0,2017-08-25T02:44:17,0.5,0.017,0.09,0.012,0.40299999999999997,0.013999999999999999,0.387,0.28300000000000003,0.026000000000000002,0.08800000000000001,0.575,0.08800000000000001
21K098,Hi Ci,brooklyn,Middle,1561,"If anyone is going to Bay, you don't have to stress too much. The first year is where teachers try to help you the best they can. That's the year you try to adjust. But, There are a lot of things you should know. For Latin, its not like you are actually learning Latin, you're only learning the prefixes and suffixes, not the actual language. For gym, the teachers honestly don't care how well you play or how talented at playing a certain sport you are. If you aren't having as much fun in this school as you thought you would, there are many different afterschool activities for you to join. If you like science, join Science Olympiad, where you get an opportunity to compete against schools and win medals. If you like sports, you can join the soccer team, boys basketball team, and/or the girls volleyball team. If you like cooking, there is a cooking club. There are other things that the afterschool program provides like music, dance, art, and the school is even introducing a student newspaper. Then, you get into 7th grade, where teachers will be very tough on you. They expect high 80's and 90's. This is because most schools like Goldstein, Midwood, and Beacon want those kinds of grades. If you are into art and you are really good at it, start making your art portfolio in order to apply for art programs for LaGuardia, Murrow, and other big schools. This also applies to people who are into performing arts (music, vocals, dance, drama). You should also find a shsat tutor, if you haven't already. The shsat gets you into specialized high schools, like Brooklyn Tech, Stuy, Brooklyn Latin, and Staten Island Tech. 7th grade is also when you should help monitor for teachers in order to get credits to get into arista/archon. Then, there is 8th grade, the year when everyone cries. Not just crying over the fact that it is their last year, but over other stuff as well. This is the year when you apply for high schools, when you get you results back, and when you graduate. Don't slack off in 8th grade, because your acceptance can be revoked. You should try to apply for arista/archon again and try to get very high 90's in as many subjects as possible. This is because you many receive an award during senior awards ceremony. On graduation, bring your arista archon pins from the past two yeas, bring you medals (Olympiad and Senior Awards), and be happy as you walk down to your seat. I hope you enjoy Bay Academy as much as I did.",0,0,0,2017-06-26T14:51:35,0.5,0.017,0.09,0.012,0.40299999999999997,0.013999999999999999,0.387,0.28300000000000003,0.026000000000000002,0.08800000000000001,0.575,0.08800000000000001

21K098,Jennifer I,brooklyn,Middle,1561,"Can I please point out that Bay Academy is an amazing school with a ranking currently higher than Mark Twain's. The teachers are amazing, they take great care of their students and they do not get enough credit.  I have so much respect for all of these amazing teachers. For example, the amazing Mrs.Maiorana who makes english class fun and easy. She knows how to gain respect from her students while obtaining a high level of intelligence in her classroom without yelling at her students. She is hands down one of the greatest teachers a student can have and I am absolutely honored to be a part of her class. I hope she continues to teach her classes at such an amazing level as she does now. Other great teachers like Dr.Cubbin who help unleash the hidden talents of the science talent students. He inspires us each and everyday. He pushes us into competitions we never though we would be doing.Who ever knew that I could build a bridge that would rank internationally as #13? Thank you Dr.Cubbin for your daily inspiration and for pushing us to our full potential. Thank you to Mr.Souer for being an amazing teacher who makes science class fun by teaching us hacks on ipads after teaching biology to 8th graders. He is a true hero who deserves an award for his amazing teaching. Thank you to Mrs.Herman who (isn't even my scinece teacher) everyday welcomes other students into her room and teaches us. She invites girls from Science talent to her room and teaches us that girls deserve a chance in science and inspires us to achieve our dreams and reach for the stars and that boys are not dominant, we are.Thank you to Mr.Lilly who taught me earth science in 7th grade although I didn't do so well. He is an amazing teacher who deserves more respect for the difficult job he does. He is  absolutely phenomenal!!!!! He is very very bright ! I truly regret not listening to his wise words when in his class. he was an amazing teacher. Mr.Lilly, if you are reading this thank you for trying your best to accommodate me when my foot was broken and for sending me extra and advance notes to help me. Thank you for being such an amazing teacher. I hope you forever remain the amazing ecstatic, full of energy and life teacher that I was lucky enough to have in the 7th grade. Let's not forget Mrs.Koltunova, a rare species of teacher. She is one of the brightest people in the world. She is caring and calm. Her tranquility adds to our learning experience and it helps us progress in Algebra. She is brilliant because she writes songs for us to learn the material to. She is amazing and no wonder she has been teaching for the past 20 years at the Bay. I hope she lasts another 20 years because her brilliance will come in handy in the future. Ms.Reznik is amazing as well she is very close to all her students and she teaches well and thoroughly which shows on her state test results. Ms.Lord is another great teacher whom I greatly respect she may be strict but she gets things done in class and is great. I am in 831 a class with an overwhelming amount of boys in it,27, and they are very rude and Ms.Lord knows how to put them back in place. She is very special because she may seem mean but she is actually amazing. Mrs.Pernicone a Latin teacher who I'm now having for a second year is also very good. She doesn't teach Latin but she does a much more important job, teaching us affixes and Latin roots, giving us an advantage in english. She expects a lot for her students not academically but in a behavioral sense.Mrs.Pernicone is awesome because she is funny and although she may not seem to friendly at first she is. Now, I can go on for hours and hours about the amazing and brilliant minds who teach at the Bay all of whom are amazing teachers and people who care a great deal for the students. It saddens me that this is my last year at the Bay, but I graduate this year knowing that I went to the BEST middle school in the world. This school is truly the best and I highly recommend this phenomenal facility to others because it is really amazing.Please come here, everyone will care for you, parent or child, everyone fits in at bay and it is amazing. I cannot find words other than amazing, and phenominal to describe this school. Now, I hope i convinced you to come to this amazing school.  Thank you to all the great teachers who made my (almost) 3 years at this school amazing and memorable.",1,0,0,2016-01-21T23:31:38,0.5,0.017,0.09,0.012,0.40299999999999997,0.013999999999999999,0.387,0.28300000000000003,0.026000000000000002,0.08800000000000001,0.575,0.08800000000000001

21K098,Anon,brooklyn,Middle,1561,"Bay Academy, is by no means a bad school. However, as I graduate this year I cannot help but feel unfulfilled. The Bay Academy provides a comfortable environment, and has several opportunities for students. However, the curriculum is not challenging and it is fairly easy to achieve high grades. Several teachers (mostly those assigned to low level classes) teach poorly and slack off on grading work etc. I do not recommend the Creative Writing program! Very little actual creative writing, rather just a sweatshop of  students constantly fulfilling deadlines for contests. There are great teachers in the school, but only high level students qualify for their classes. The guidance counselors are fantastic,and are very dedicated to the high school process and students!

Im sure you will love Bay Academy. No, there are no lockers. They have this thing where you leave your coat in your 1st period class and come back to get it after your last period class. When you first start out, you'll find it pretty big, but then it will start to feel small, as it does get crowded in the staircases sometimes. It is a very pretty school, in my opinion. I really love the science classrooms especially, because they are well decorated. Homework depends on the teacher, although I didn't feel as if I got a lot, (there were days when none of my teachers gave homework) some kids say they get a lot. Though there will be days where you will be working on them for a while, so try not to do them at the last minute. So the amount of homework could range from nothing to a lot. The teachers here are absolutely remarkable. They push their students to do their very best. Plus, they always help you out when you have a problem and they are amazing people. Just never get on their bad sides to have a good time. Oh, and they just adore teachers' pets, haha! Which teacher doesn't?

21K098,AnonymousKiddo,brooklyn,Middle,1561,"I am an eighth grader in Bay Academy and will be graduating this June. Overall, it IS a pretty good school. I've managed to make so many friends while maintaining my old ones. I feel that many of the teachers actually care about teaching the students, which is a good thing. As a student in science talent, i have to complain. In sixth grade, us being a relatively noisy bunch, learned a suitable amount about Forensics from Ms. Musoff (who is also in charge of builder's club). In seventh grade, we had robotics with Ms. Katz. It was a completely student-oriented thing, with us getting little to no instruction on how to build or program, only getting tasks from her. It was basically survival of the fittest and we had to go to the students who actually had the expertise to build and program well, while we few not so strong in these skills, struggled along. In eighth grade, we are supposed to be building bridges, but Ms. Katz and our other talent teachers want a lot from us this year. Such as a virtual bridge that costs under X amount of dollars, a scale model bridge that's stable, and a research report, leaving us to figure out how to do each ourselves with little instruction, like in seventh grade. Even though my talent might be the hardest in the school (i can only speak for myself), I do admit that i like it and i've enjoyed my time at this school. I favor it over Mark Twain. Oh, and one more thing, the budget cuts HAVE affected our school slightly but one thing doesn't make sense to me; they can't afford to buy air conditioners for each classroom filled with sweltering heat in the summer, yet they CAN afford to hire new teachers, pay for Edline, AND supply each classroom, even the auditorium, with a highly unnecessary Activ/Promethean board? Some things just don't add up. We are also required to learn Latin instead of opting to learn Spanish, Italian, or French. Any incoming sixth graders, i have this to say to you: Don't waste the years you have here, they'll be some of the greatest of your life if you spend them well.

""I was appointed to the school in 1982 and worked under several administrative leaders prior to Mrs. Catalano. As a senior teacher I can assure you that during those years, the quality of education was excellent. Our qualified and talented teachers always worked hard, and were never 'apprehensive' or 'scared' to try new instructional approaches! Our instructional materials were current and in alignment with the New York City Department of Education's Standards. PS 121, along with many other city schools, first implemented the Balanced Literacy Program in September 2004, prior to Mrs. Catalano's arrival. Our teachers have always addressed the educational and emotional individual needs of each and every student in the building without the newly required assessment binder. (There is no social/emotional component within this newly designed binder.) Thus we named ourselves 'The School that Makes a Difference.' We upheld that statement and prided ourselves in making a positive difference in the life of each and every child. In previous years, PS 121 had the support of a very active parent population. However, parents are now reluctant to get involved. Why? Our most recent principal, who retired in January 2004, was loved by our students and their parents. He supported his staff and genuinely cared about the well being of each and every member of our school community. He had an open line of communication and positive working relationship with local city officials and religious leaders. We did not appear to be a 'family,' we were one. The picture you have presented of PS 121 is inaccurate. I do agree that the school is decorated nicely.

 my grandchildren are jammed into classes with more than 30 kids in 
them.  The principal accepted 200 plus special ed kids that run across 
all kind of kids with learning disabilities or with severe emotional 
problems.  Sorry, but in my opinion, that's no good.  It lowers the 
value of the school.  I like what's going on in the upper grades with 
computer programming and other stuff, that's great, but why do you have 
accept money for jamming kids desk by desk into classes where if you 
come to visit, you can barely get by because these kids tables are 
shoved too close together?  I ask you?  Is that a good trade-off?  Most 
mornings I drop my granddkids off at the front of the building, but 
occasionally if there is parking I park on E 2nd Street and walk them 
around.  It's a litttle frightening to see the school buses dropping the
 new special ed kids on the side entrance of the building, and see an 
army of teachers come out to get the kids one at a time to bring them 
into the overcrowded building.  Is that good?  Not to me.

And 
yup, I agreee with the bully problems at the school.  I think that 
because the kids are younger the school thinks problems will go away if 
they talk to the kid and dont follow through with a punshment like 
suspending, or whatnot.  Personally, I'm not too happy with what my own 
granddkids went through.  The kids that bullied them were pretty mean, 
and my daughter was up the principal's you-know-what when she found out 
her son's bully was slapped on the wrist.  That was when the principal 
did something, and the boy was brought up on charges, or whatever they 
do at the school.  I've talked to other parents and similar things have 
happened to their kids.  I think the school is lazy about these things 
because it's just kids, and nothing really bad has happened.  I guess 
we've been lucky.  This isn't a bad neighborhood, though bad things have
 happend, like that poor kletsky boy being kidnapped a couple of years 
ago by the school, and that coin dealer being kidnapped and murdered 
down the block on Kings Highway.  Bad things happen everywhere.  Like I 
said, we been lucky.

My suggestion is that the school be tougher 
on the bad kids.  I know thehy don't want to call them that anymore, but
 that's how I see it, and also enough with the overcrowding.

And for chrissakes, stop those teachers that scream from screaming in the kids faces so much!  Enough!",0,0,0,2013-12-02T04:10:49,0.75,0.233,0.163,0.047,0.9,0.032,0.59,0.248,0.015,0.253,0.47,0.213

Edible Schoolyard NYC is a non profit organization that partners with schools to engage children in learning that makes the connection between food, health and how the Earth sustains us, cultivating the knowledge, skills and environment required to change the way children eat for life. 

The garden, greenhouse and kitchen will support the Edible Schoolyard NYC program that already reaches every child at P.S. 216 and teaches them how every day food choices not only affect their own health, but also the health of the environment.  Edible Schoolyard NYC lessons foster sound nutritional practices, responsible food choices, and environmental stewardship in a four season growing environment. Lessons extend well beyond garden and kitchen classrooms to engage parents, energize the school community, and transform school lunch.

I will say that these three years spent at boody was the best.  The teachers are very kind, and are always there for their students whenever they need help.  There are teachers who are a little more laid back than others which isn't always good, but now speaking on assignments, the assignments are not always as challenging as I first expected in my first year at boody.  Some assignments will be challenging depending on what teacher you have, I had the easy teachers.  This school also provides honors classes, and again, my expectations were nothing like how it turned out.  As a student who has been in honors for three years, the work isn't always more challenging than the work regular classes get.  The work only changes when you reach the eighth grade, if you get put into a regents class (instead of just 8th grade math, you get a combination of Algebra 1 which is high school level math, and regular 8th grade math.  Instead of 8th grade science, you take a combination of Living Environment which is also high school level, and regular 8th grade science.  You will also get Earth science if you choose to be in a science magnet.)  8th grade will be challenging, but it really isn't that bad if you put the effort in.  If you end up taking those classes in 8th grade, good job you'll earn high school credits!!  Enough of assignments, I'll speak on bullying!  The bullying in this school is not that intense, but I feel that most teachers and staff can't really do anything to help.

Most of the teachers care about their students, and go out of the way to make their classes enjoyable. The 6th grade classwork could be slightly more challenging, but that's just my opinion. The dean isn't the greatest, but you get used to her. At lunch, they separated boys and girls on different sides of the cafeteria(meaning you could only eat lunch with your gender). The transition to remote learning was a chaotic but manageable one. However, only three of my teachers would host zoom meetings for help on the classwork, so kids who needed extra help didn't get much of it.

Bullying happens in this school. A friend of mine was targeted by a nasty group of girls that talked about her behind her back. We students don't know how to use the anti-bullying program BRIDG-IT to report incidents. Occasionally, there were fist fights.

21K228,Linette,brooklyn,Middle,1413,"My daughter attended David Boody from grade 6 to 8 till 2017.  She has always been a straight A student since young age with all her grades above 95. She is a good kid and plays piano at a high level Mozart and Tchaikovsky. Now let me tell you about this school David Boody.  This is a good school only if your kid doesn't required the school staff or principal to provide extra attention to your child who is in the general education. Maybe because this school is overcrowded so the staff can't be bothered if your general ed child needs assistance.They took my daughter out of some of her programs and placed her in programs that she and I did not want her to be in without my consent or informing me. My daughter was miserable. Even after I wrote the school a few letters to have her switch back they said no and it wasn't due to because my daughter had bad grades. I guess because the school was crowded so only certain kids get ""better seat"" and my daughter her skin is not white. Nor do I have any inside connections or belong to their parent teacher association.  
When I requested David Boody office staff and the teachers from their music department about the NYSMMA program from the New York state, they have no clue what I was talking about and told me they have nothing to do with it. They didn't provide me any help and were extremely incompetent. Very unprofessional.  New York state and the NYC board of education required the child's public school to provide information and application for  NYSMMA when parents make the request. I almost wrote a letter to the Board of education and district 21 to file a complaint against David Boody for their incompetent teachers and staff.   
Their school security guards are the rudest workers I have ever seen and one of the security guard even argued with me because my daughter arrived at their summer program at 7:30am instead of 8am for their breakfast which starts at 7:30am. He refused to let my daughter in and  told me my 7th grade daughter can't go inside for breakfast because no adult is supervising in the cafeteria and she should come back at 8am when class starts. I told him then the school should assign an adult because kids who attend summer school do eat breakfast at 7:30 provided by the city.  This went on the whole summer the guard was very rude to my daughter and me because my daughter wanted to eat school breakfast. I called the main office but they didn't do anything to rectify the problem. 
These are just a few examples what is like being a parent with a child who attends David Boody. Your child in the general ed program doesn't  get any help unless the parents fight for it... even something so simple as eating school breakfast.   The school is located in a good neighborhood and the students most of them are from that neighborhood which is one of the two reasons why it is a good school. It's safe in a safe location. The second reason why it is a good school it's because David Boody gets lots of funding from working class taxpayers like me and you. They have good art,dance, and music programs. They have good afterschool programs. To get into programs that your child wants require the parents to put in efforts either get inside connections or be part of their parent teacher association. Try to get to know the staff to get inside info. The good programs get filled up quickly.  Don't expect the teachers, staff, and principal in David Boody to be excellent and go above and beyond. They are there because that's where they work.  In David Boody you should rely on yourself as a parent that your child is getting a good appropriate education and don't rely on the school staff. Some of the classes my daughter was put in the teachers can't teach and my daughter ahd to teach herself from reading text books and online on her own with my help. Luckily my daughter graduated with an average of 95 because she is one of those who can learn on her own without any adult teaching.",0,0,0,2017-09-09T18:40:21,0.75,0.128,0.158,0.033,0.905,0.048,0.614,0.293,0.052000000000000005,0.254,0.392,0.155

In order to be good and competent teachers, you really need to find ways to intrigue and stimulate students.  The teacher needs to make students want to learn.  I find that even in some honors' classes, test questions were quite simple and lack depth.  Also, there is no need to boost up the grades by given out a 10 point bonus question.  We were just at the Science fair this month and the quality of these projects were poor and disappointing.  I have seen better projects from elementary school students.  Many of these chosen projects were not proofread and lack effort.  Most of them appeared to have put together their projects in a day or two.   Anyway, the only positive thing my daughter gained from this school is self-confidence.  Her self-esteem has been boosted because  the work load in this school is easier than her elementary school.  Students in this school are not as studious.  This school does not welcome parent participation in their children's education.  The school does not provide enough updates to parents or invitations for parents to come to school to view our child's progress.

21K228,person,brooklyn,Middle,1413,"This school is O.K. instead of particularly good or bad.  Most of the academic teachers are very nice and teach well though many are young and lack experience.  School of One is the math program the school uses which entitles the student's use of laptops to learn math with little teacher interaction.  It teaches but has many bugs that mess around with student's grades and screws up the learning experience.  I personally remember having tests with questions drastically harder than the practice the lessons gave and sometimes  being assigned lessons that were two years ahead of my grade level because I was an advanced student.  However, the honors math program is great and most of my class received high scores on the math regents. The teachers at this school definitely made the learning experience fun and memorable for the most part.  However the magnet department lacks many strong and caring teachers.  Other students have complained to me about their magnet, but I, who has never taken these courses cannot verify this as true or not.  The instrumental department has two great and hard working teachers that create a wonderful magnet experience, but I don't know much else about the other magnet teachers besides the vocal/musical theater magnet.  The vocal teacher has been shown to display favoritism among her students and often yells at them, especially nearing the time of a show date.  Nearing the time of a show date she also pulls children from classes for day rehearsals, though the number of day rehearsals she's had has been declining.  She really doesn't measure a child's talent by their ability to perform and more so by how much she likes them personally.  She acts much more like a strict director than a professional teacher.  I also wouldn't expect many special offers or awards from the school unless you as a parent like to show up to the school to complain every now and again.  The office and guidance counselor are also very nice and caring.  Overall. the school has great academics but shows many cracks in it's magnet courses.",0,0,0,2016-08-14T22:00:05,0.75,0.128,0.158,0.033,0.905,0.048,0.614,0.293,0.052000000000000005,0.254,0.392,0.155

The principal hires many per diems (subs) to teach classes instead of hiring licensed teachers. The school is typically known for coddling young teachers as per diems who are struggling to pass their teacher credential exams. Many of my college's present and former graduate students are employed at IS 228, and in my opinion, not competent to teach junior high students. Of course, this not reflect the college's ability to educate upcoming educators, because there are numerous students who have gone on to do wonderful things in the education field. Still it does not take away that IS 228 takes on prospective teachers who might have made unwise choices when it comes to their preparation in becoming educators. As a former teacher and now an education professor of 7 years, it bothers me to see many intelligent and qualified young teachers who are struggling to find employment in today's economy, because principals like Mr. D'Angelo prefer to save money and hire per diems who are not certified.

His hard work and guidance to his team of teachers and staff is very greatly appreciated.  His remarkable selflessness is visible in the long extra hours he puts in to make David A. Boody a great environment for his students each and every day.  

He can teach other principals how to turn a school around and make it exceptional.  I have only the greatest admiration for Mr. D'Angelo because of his profound effect on all of his students.  He is able to motivate his students while always staying positive.  I truly appreciate his leadership qualities.  Mr. D'Angelo is someone you know you can always count on no matter what.  His concern and sensitivity in dealing with all kind of issues is remarkable.  He is always there to help and handles every situation like a professional. 

I am sure other parents feel the way I do.  I cannot thank Mr. D'Angelo enough for being such a great example to all of his students.  As a parent it is important knowing that the school that you send your child to is a wonderful and safe learning environment.  I consider myself extremely grateful to have my daughter at David A.

Unfortunately, you are an unhappy person who was probably excessed and have nothing better to do by creating lies.  You as a person and as an educator should be ashamed of yourself. In the long run, you are hurting our children and your colleagues as well.  How could you sleep at night verbally attacking our children?

The experience was rich at Shellbank.  I have no complaints from the teachers who started working with Emanuel in the sixth grade.  They were awesome.  And to have two of them in the seventh was simply awesome.  While his final year was a challenge he rose to the occasion because Dr. Gill, Ms. Gonzales, and others were not having it.  Especially Ms. Gonazales who seem to understand much of Emanuel's needs.

At first I was so skeptical because of the distance and the location but I have found that some of the best teaching is areas where you least expected.  Well, enough of that.

Summer Emanuel got into The Trio program which will mentor him throughout his high school years.  I am grateful because it takes some of the pressure off of me worrying about this journey.  However, I plan on being as active as I can to support.

Well enough your summer and come back ready to begin a new school year with joy and excitement.  Our children need you.

22K139,Megan Demarkis,brooklyn,Elementary,880,"My son is a Kindergartner in Ms. Zafra's dual language class.  In our school search last year we looked at multiple programs at charter, public and private schools across  several Brooklyn neighborhoods.  We chose PS 139 not only because we think it's important to invest our time and collaborative energy in our local zoned school but also because we found that the school environment and philosophy is aligned to what makes young learners thrive: a child focused environment that is both  progressive and collaborative.  When I went for a tour and a classroom observation at PS 139 back in Spring 2016, I found a welcoming atmosphere where children felt special and parents were engaged as partners in building a positive culture.  Every classroom that I saw that day and since our enrollment this past fall is characterized by collaborative learning and small group instruction.  Teachers are energetic and professional.  They do not prioritize standardized testing but they do use intentional assessment so that they can differentiate instruction.  Teachers meet kids where they are so that they can develop confidence and grow.  Since joining the School Leadership Team, I have learned that enrichment through purposeful play, arts, movement, and the sciences are a school-wide priority.  Teachers integrate play, inquiry and creative expression through the core subjects (Math and Literacy) and every class schedule features at least one enrichment activity taught by a specialist every day.  There is an active core of diverse parents who serve on various committees as leaders and key decision makers in conjunction with teachers, counselors and administrators.  Parents collaborate to drive in external resources through grants and donations as well as lead community events and celebrations.  3 months into kindergarten, my son has a big roster of friends who speak multiple languages and he is embracing the challenge to become bilingual himself.  This December, he is obsessed with the sequential story telling skills he is practicing in his Reader's Workshop.  He is also singing in Spanish and learning to solve problems with pictures and logic.  I was worried that his profound love of play and his curious nature wouldn't be nourished in a large classroom....that he would be lost.  So far, I find that he is flourishing.  His teacher is keenly aware of his strengths and challenge areas and is always willing to give me a summary or a quick anecdote at the end of the day.  We have about 15 minutes of homework each day.  Just enough for me to connect to what he is learning and help reinforce some good learning habits at home.  In addition to teaching children to read, write and speak in 2 languages, Ms. Zafra uses a progressive games based math program and makes sure that there is a purposeful play period that integrates hands on social studies and science exploration.  In summary, my son is having fun while learning in a caring environment.  I would recommend this school to every parent who wants their child to develop a strong sense of empathy, appreciation for diversity and a lifelong zest for learning.",2,0,0,2016-12-12T17:52:32,0.75,0.161,0.18899999999999997,0.065,0.9179999999999999,0.122,0.665,0.191,0.249,0.423,0.106,0.2

22K139,emmessell,brooklyn,Elementary,880,"I am the parent of a student at PS 139, and I do not recognize the school in this review and in the comments.  We have had a very positive experience at PS 139.  We actually turned down a G&T spot at another district school in favor of PS 139, even though the mini-schools have been discontinued for incoming students.  

The school has a very strong community, and I appreciate that the principal is very present and attentive. I'm also pleased with my child's progress and I feel that he is being challenged. He LOVES school. He has joined the chess club and is in one of the many after-school programs on the campus.  As a working parent, I appreciate the excellent after-school options and the flexible schedule of PA meetings.  There are many opportunities and invitations to be involved in the classroom for parents who are able.

PS 139 has had low test scores, as this review mentions. However, the school saw a huge improvement in 2015-2016, and I feel that things are moving in the right direction.  Academics receive a lot of focus in the classroom, but not at the expense of play, exercise, or field trips.  

I am so grateful for this school community, and encourage other parents to tour PS 139 and talk to community members about their experiences with this outstanding school.",2,0,0,2016-12-08T15:04:42,0.75,0.161,0.18899999999999997,0.065,0.9179999999999999,0.122,0.665,0.191,0.249,0.423,0.106,0.2
22K139,Kelly L,brooklyn,Elementary,880,"My daughter is a current student at 139.  I find it to be a warm, welcoming and diverse environment.   Her classroom teacher is fantastic. She's kind, progressive and places a strong value on play. The classroom is big and bright. It's filled with books, blocks, artwork and student writing. I've been impressed by the approach to reading and writing. Students are encouraged to be ""brave"" readers and writers. They're taught to put themselves out there to try and spell a word and not worry if it doesn't look like adult spelling.  This approach works well for my daughter, who in the past has been hung up about making mistakes.  I also like that it acknowledges this type of learning can be difficult and scary for kids, and empowers them to be strong together.

Outside the classroom, each week my daughter has science, dance, art, music and gym.  All children go outside for recess first and have lunch after.  Parents are encouraged to participate in classroom activities.  It's not yet December and there's already been three invitations to take neighborhood walks with the kids (for example to study trees, or look for geometry in the ""wild""), a visit to a firehouse and a field trip to a farm. Once a month, there's a Family Visit day, where parents may sit in on an hour of class or activity. There was a Thanksgiving show (kindergartners singing and dancing! The cuteness!) and a classroom feast for kids and families.

Despite lousy reviews here, we were hopeful about sending our daughter to 139 based on the feedback of a few friends and a promising school tour.

I worked there for more than four years as a substitute, hoping to earn a position as a regular teacher, while having all the mandatory certifications necessary to practice. To my surprise, the school had an overwhelming amount of TEACH America and FELLOWS teachers working. i was not offered even an interview (by my own request to have one). After all my educational experience, since it was easily replacable with an individual who majored in philosophy out in the midwest and couldn't find a job in it!  All of this,  while not having the slightest amount of experience. During the course of my per diem work, (4 years) more than 12 teachers from fellows and teach america have been hired. I purposely did not send my own 6 year old to this school, because through my experienceI know that the thoroughness is not there. Some of the teachers have very little background knowledge in thier field. and they cut corners by hiring less qualified people to teach some of these classes. I opted for a charter school close by, although i was wait listed for quite a while. A lot of the teachers there are afraid to talk to each other or say too much in front of everyone. The atmosphere is very tense.The positive  attitudes are very artificial and smiles are plastered on. Everyone is afraid of each other. In the end, i got sick of it and left.

The teachers my children have are smart, caring and well rounded teachers.  I have been very happy with the quality of the teachers my children have had.  I like the fact that they have also been the same teacher for all 3 of my children which has allowed me to build a great relationship with each teacher. Have a good line of communication with them. I am able to email them with any questions or concerns. They have always been very accessible to talk to when I need to.
The mini school offers a open door policy, which lets parents come into the class room and volunteer and help the teacher out.  This was a very important factor in choosing this school, having access to my children class room.  I enjoy coming to the class and getting to know all the children in the class.
All the class rooms have Smart Boards.  Kids get gym and go outside every day with lunch. 

Enrichment:
PS 139 offers plenty of enrichment programs.
Art
Studio in the School
Music for the Brains - Keyboard
Recorder
Dance
Cook Shop 
Science
Chess
Gym
Computer


Plus great after school clubs:
Chorus
Band (Guitar, Violin, all the Brass instruments)
Extended day for those children in need of extra help in school
plus a 5 day a week after school program

They have a nationally ranked Chess Club.  The school has a full time chess teacher, each child gets chess in the school, plus there is a chess club 3 days a week after school. The children go to weekend tournaments and travel to State and National tournaments.

I have been very happy happy at 139, the teachers are good and we have a great PA who works hard in fundraising. They have planned great events at the school, such as science night, Fright night, and a Halloween pumpkin patch.

22K139,Former PS 139 Parent,brooklyn,Elementary,880,"THANK YOU FORMER 139 TEACHER FOR TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SCHOOL!!!  The CULTURE OF FEAR you describe does not only exist for teachers but for students and parents as well.  

For parents, one way this fear is acheived is via the administration's copious reports to ACS for the tiniest infractions.  Parents also become very susceptible being terrorized by this administration if they voice any disagreement.  I know cases in which wildly bogus charges were leveled against parents, most single moms, resulting in these parents being afraid to challenge anything about the administrations decisions for their children.  BTW, one of these moms told me that the ACS investigator told her not to panic about the report as the PS 139 administration's reports have earned them the reputation of being ""Drama Queen Central"" down at the local ACS office!  (Thank you 139 for distracting our already overwhelmed ACS investigators with bogus claims.  Somewhere in the city some parent is truly abusing a child while a city worker has to work out your grudge for you.)

The PA in no way functions as a bridge between parents and the administration but as some other parents have described - as principal Mary McDonald's ""spies.""  Really, I didn't believe this before I witnessed it but all evidence seems to point to this.  

Finally, please note that not only are many teachers ignorant of administrative know-how, some seem to have trouble putting together a sentence in proper English.  Many of these teachers are those hired in the late 70s and early 80s when anyone with a pencil qualified for a teaching job in NYC.  (Few wanted teaching jobs in NYC during the era of race riots and student walk-outs...So we hired the worst...and they just won't leave!)  Now these same unqualified teachers march around the halls of 139 with a huge chip on their shoulder because they've been employed for so long.  It's a disgrace with a 40 year history!

Ok.  I said my peace.  Parents be forewarned.  Unless you really dig drama and want to join the bogus PA so that you can bully other parents, PS 139 is not for you.  I pulled my kids out because after witnessing the mess at 139, I realize I'm interested only their education and have no desire to have them under the dictates of PS 139s fascist regime.  SANE PARENTS BEWARE AND GOOD LUCK TO FORMER PS 139 TEACHER.  YOU ROCK!",4,1,0,2011-09-28T16:02:23,0.75,0.161,0.18899999999999997,0.065,0.9179999999999999,0.122,0.665,0.191,0.249,0.423,0.106,0.2

22K139,Former 139 Teacher,brooklyn,Elementary,880,"This school has some great teachers and some not so great teachers, but the administration is completely incompetent and creates a culture of fear. Two of the Assistant Principals have very little experience with the subjects and types of teaching they are in charge of overseeing. And the Principal runs the school through fear. Teachers are forced to change classrooms with very little notice and written up for tiny infractions - or given unsatisfactory ratings - even after years and years of meritorious (or satisfactory) service. A teacher who vocally disagrees with the administration becomes very susceptible to being written up or given a low rating, hence a culture of fear is created which is not good for the students. Most of the talented teachers leave due to the administration's lack of knowledge and support. I would know - I'm one among many.",8,1,0,2011-07-14T00:43:40,0.75,0.161,0.18899999999999997,0.065,0.9179999999999999,0.122,0.665,0.191,0.249,0.423,0.106,0.2

Currently, I am running from the same situation. Inexperienced administration who runs the schools out of fear, sudden mid-year changes in schedules, unfair ratings, untenured union reps being preyed on, etc. Seems to be the new wave of the DOE.

http://abc7ny.com/education/father-arrested-and-injured-after-confronting-teacher-about-not-letting-young-son-use-bathroom/1219555/

I ask, shouldn't all allegations be investigated including the numerous against Administration?

 To be clear, I do not have a student at this school (hopefully I do not; come September). However, I am reading and hearing (as I still live in the neighborhood) about a lot of happenings- all surrounding insensitivity towards kids, including the rigid manner of speaking to students, adhering to mandates, at least 3 bathroom incidents noted recently and ""Drill and Kill"" type teaching etc. Something is happening here and it does not look good! 

Typically schools with active parents and a strong PTA have better successes that includes higher test scores and a higher rate of student progress but also social emotional growth; basically happy, bright, morally sound kids. It appears that the focus of the Administration is only on $$ (Budget) and # (Test scores), I mean why else is there very little enrichment, very few FT therapists, low number of school trips and allegedly kids that are mandated to stay in their seats all day. Is the thought that if they leave the class for 5 mins that they will miss vital test prep and cause lower test scores or does it cost the Administration money to let kids go the bathroom?

22K193,Ellie,brooklyn,Elementary,686,"Brooklyn Father Arrested After His Child Denied Bathroom At School Again!
February 24, 2016

Baseball player Gil Hodges represented the best in Brooklyn, the best in Baseball, and was known to demonstrate the best characteristics on how to treat people, especially during that particularly tumultuous time in the country.

Unfortunately, the school bearing his name on Avenue L in Midwood, Brooklyn can no longer be associated with the same stunning attributes.

Over the past three years, since Principal Tami Flynn was gifted the top job at the school by then Superintendent Rhonda D. Farkas, there has been a culture shift for the worse. The much loved and heralded school slogan of ""Be respectful Be Nice"" was removed and now many parents and children have documented instances of bullying, retaliation, and false charges and accusations all lead by the Principal Flynn. Many of the programs that made the school highly sought-after have been removed without explanation. The highly coveted Gifted and Talented program at the school is being taught by teachers that do not hold the required state license. Only two (2) out of the six (6) teachers in the program are currently licensed.

While today began no differently at PS 193, it surely ended with a very clear picture. If parents ask questions, they will be arrested. Parent volunteer and school advocate to many, Vinny, was the target today (as he is most of the days). Yesterday, his 7 year-old second grader asked to go to the bathroom and was denied by staff although there is a directive on file that Vinny's son must be able to go to the bathroom. He was not permitted to do so yesterday, and soiled his clothing. This also happened earlier in the school year, where he had an emergency, was denied access to the bathroom, defecated on himself, and was forced to sit in it all school day long. His parents were not contacted, his clothes were not changed and were only made aware at dismissal when the child informed him of what transpired.

Fast forward to this morning. Vinny saw the teacher who denied his son access standing on the sidewalk escorting students off of the school bus as usual. Vinny approached the teacher and informed the male instructor that his son has a mandate that he can go to the bathroom at anytime. The Principal who was also on the sidewalk jumped in and began berating the parent. The parent walked away and went to work. At about 1PM this afternoon, the parent received a call from officers at the 70th Precinct who informed him that he needed to get to the school now. Vinny was nervous, but his gut instinct lead him to believe that something was not right. He left work, picked up his wife, and headed to the school.

Once there, he waited in the school vestibule with other parents and two other officers as it was nearing afternoon dismissal. An officer who was already in the school entered the vestibule directed Vinny to remove his hands from his pockets, asked if he had any weapons on his person, and then instructed Vinny to put his hands behind his back. The office proceeded to cuff Vinny and make him do the perp walk onto the sidewalk in front of his son's school.

To make matters worse, the police officers lead him into the patty wagon. With his cuffed hands behind his back, the officer nudged him into the van, where he fell and hit his head. He laid out on the sidewalk in front of the school until a parent called for EMS services.

While parents stood on the sidewalk in complete and utter shock, the police yelled that parents would be arrested if they did not leave the school block or go across the street.

Parents have repeatedly reported the sick pattern of abuse of power at the school to the DOE, District 22 Superintendent's office, and anyone that would listen to no avail. Parents have long requested the Principal's removal.

Today is Vinny's child's birthday.",0,0,0,2016-02-26T02:14:54,0.75,0.19399999999999998,0.226,0.064,0.9470000000000001,0.057,0.561,0.17300000000000001,0.42100000000000004,0.14,0.19,0.177

22K193,Ellie,brooklyn,Elementary,686,"The parent coordinator, Ms Esper left as well - after only 1 year and during the summer without notice to the parents.  As a continuation of a string of odd experiences at the school with no notice to the parents (or lying by the administration that notice had been sent and then trying to guilt the parents into thinking they just are not good enough parents by staying on top of things), the PA president became the parent coordinator.  Thankfully, she had enough common sense to resign from the presidency.  But, yes, the former strong G&T or ""CIG"" program has gone downhill with the 4th and 5th grade classes being combined for the first time this year.  Awful awful idea.  And again with NO prior notice to the parents - it was a big surprise in September for all of us.  All I can say is they would NEVER do that to special education students, so why to gifted students?  French is being phased out with the 4th and 5th grade G&T students being the last classes to receive it.  And Spanish (for all students) is being phased in this year.  The Robotics program is long dead and likely will never be resurrected.  The music program which we fought so hard for under Mr. Cimino has been systematically dismantled.

Also, Mr. Cimino practically admonished the CIG kids directly in the first paragraph of his missive to the parents explaining the poor grade for the school.  Aside from that, CIG is barely given acknowledgement as a specialized program for kids who tested as gifted.  There is a culture of providing enrichment for all or enrichment for none.  In a competitive, dog eat dog world, and that world is what NYC is when you leave the cloistered environment of elementary school, one must accommodate the fact that there are those who have chosen a program for its enrichment purposes.  Had I known the CIG would be treated almost no differently from the gen ed, I would have chosen a different school or scrimped and saved for private.

To that end, the principal is un-interested in any attempts by engaged parents to effect change or add enrichment programs.  Even if said parents are willing to shoulder the burden of cost, time and effort.  It's a real shame.

With that said.  My child has forged strong friendships and bonds with classmates and since the CIG class moves together each year (only one CIG class per grade) I know they'll be together for the full 6 years of K - 5th (aside from attrition).

Mr. Cimino is very responsive to parents and does an exceptional job of making sure the students receive the best that the school budget can offer. He and the staff are always readily available for parents and students. The staff is truly outstanding. The family environment can be felt from the good morning smile you get from the crossing guard, to the welcome you get from the security guard Ms. Murphy at the front door. There are always parents from the Parent's Association at the front door throughout the day. My son started at Gil Hodges in grade K and is now in grade 2. His teachers Mrs. Abell and Ms. Rouse are absolutely fabulous. They pushed my son beyond expectations and he excelled in Reading and Math. His reading level is four levels above his grade level and his math skills are very strong as well. My son enjoys participating in annual shows. I don't think he gets differential treatment compared to the talented and gifted students. I wish Gil Hodges didn't lose funding for the music teacher, librarian and other programs. The ripple effects of the loss are significant and are evident even here by parent's comments about feeling left out and not having access to the same resources as the students in the talented and gifted program. In summary I give PS 193 Gil Hodges School 4 stars!! With additional funding - they can get the 5th star.

My kids are attending this school.  I cannot wait when this nightmare will end.  The teachers are only screaming and punishing.
That is all they do.  No art, no gym in
school. 90% of the kids have tutors and that helps school to get good results
and reputation.  If kids ask any add’l
questions – they will hear a scream back.

I'll never forget how in fourth grade(The Gifted and Talented class) my teacher used to pick on me or make me feel like i was dumb. I remember how we sat in groups and we would always compete with each other to get the highest score. If you got a question right, your team would get a point. One day, the teacher(I wont say her name) realized my team was in last place, so she moved ME to the winning team; team 4. I didn't understand her questions when she called on me so i ended up losing points for our team. Eventually team 4 lost the lead and the teacher said, ""Before (I) went to team 4 everybody wanted to be on that team, now nobody does because they are doing horrible."" It was one of the worst days of elementary school for me, the kids at my table all scowled at me, one even said, "" I wish you would leave our team! We'd be beetter of without you.""other said, ""I'm glad she's not on my team!"" I almost cried that day.

The principal, Joy Ann Morgan, is a self-centered tyrant, rude and unprofessional to parents, students, and teachers. Why the fact that 30 students transferred out after experiencing her leadership for not even one year,
complaints are stacked high against her, and students are allowed to run the halls, abusing other students, even throwing feces is beyond reproach. A once-wonderful school, granted in a tough urban area, that still has great teachers, has fallen into the clutches of Bloomberg and Leadership Academy, a private organization that teaches it's administrators to ""cut"" the fat, as they see fit. My child is not a number, and if Ms. Morgan HAD children, maybe she would understand. Anyone who defends this principal's ill begotten position is either seeking to promote their own interest or is totally misguided. It is a shame that parents do not unite to have her removed and replaced by a REAL principal, one that everyone respects, not fears, as they have in other schools. Your child's future is in your hands. Get them the educational justice they deserve.

22K206,M.D.,brooklyn,K-8,1518,"This school is a total disgust! There's only a handful of teachers/staff that is willing to do their job. 
Most teachers (it started with us when my kid was at 1st grade) don't check homework but assign other kids from the class to do that. Class work is often done same way - kids work in groups checking each other and making comments what should be done to improve. 
A kid that passes state tests at the 4th level gets a report card filled with 1-2 grades having most of the home and class work done. A well advanced reader gets 2 in the report card for reading. 
Teachers are highly neglectful and show total disrespect towards parents just saying ""I have 30/32 kids in my class, what do u expect?!"" When I was at school thee were 38 of us but teachers actually did their work (we only wished we could check our work ourselves).
The only thing they care is lunch forms and attendance (because school funding depends on attendance too).
For our 3-rd  grade state tests we were told that school lost its funding for test prep materials and we had to chip in for books ($15 each, better get both). It was in October. We got the books at the end of January given the fact that April is the test month. 
The program is weak. Even their ""enrichment"" class' one. Kids are bored. Try to avoid doing any work as it gets repeated over and over again. It's been three years so far that I see teachers practice working on one essay for 5 weeks just rewriting it and adding more details and small moments to it. 
One of the years they didn't have any gym for more than 2 months because school didn't get the gym schedule right. Was fixed by February. Another year they had gym twice a week and would often miss it as ""gym was busy"". But at the same time school provides parents with requirements kids have to be able to do physically for their PEd test.

At that time, the school was k to 8.  Not to discount high school or college, yet  the basic skills learned early in life that have had the most practical application, it seems.  The classrooms and teaching environment certainly seem more pleasant and conducive to learning than the rows of desk with inkwells in the upper right hand corner, which  were extant when I attended.

But she writes that ""oversight is lacking during the lunch period"" and ""complaints from parents to administrators fell on deaf ears."" She writes: ""Despite the opening of a beautiful new playground my son rarely gets outside to use it. Instead--all the kindergartners watch movies on a daily basis. Many of the movies are not age-appropriate. Watching 'High School Musical' four times during school hours is disgraceful.""  
<P>Principal Franca Conti responds: ""I appreciate the praise for our school, as we work hard to provide a nurturing, welcoming, and educational atmosphere. It is our policy that lunch supervision is very tight, while still allowing the children some important time to relax and socialize with their classmates. We, as a community, appreciate parental concerns and listen carefully. While we might not always be able to do things exactly as every parent wants, we always take their concerns seriously and respond expeditiously. 
<P>""With respect to outdoor play, I encourage it as much as possible. Weather permitting, we have physical education classes outside in the new school yard, and get the children out at lunchtime as much as possible. Currently, different grades go outside two or three times per week, and we are actively seeking parent volunteers at lunchtime to allow the children to go out even more often. I wholeheartedly support the need for children to get as much physical activity as possible, and asked the teachers to take their students outside to play after the state tests so the children could let off some steam. I believe in letting kids be kids.
<P>""When the weather does not permit outdoor play, we do often show movies in the auditorium. Some children watch, while others read or talk to their friends. The movies have been screened by parents and staff members, and sometimes they are 'educational' and sometimes they are shown simply because we feel the children will enjoy them. We try to tie movies into the curriculum - e.g. we showed Beverly Cleary and Dr. Seuss films to celebrate these authors' birthdays, and our school librarian has a large collection of films based on books. Because the children only watch the movie for approximately 15 minutes per day, we do show the same film on multiple days until it is completed.""</P>",0,0,0,2007-03-30T20:13:42,1.0,0.264,0.139,0.028999999999999998,0.8490000000000001,0.1,0.735,0.525,0.08900000000000001,0.16699999999999998,0.18600000000000003,0.243

 Comments on Inside Schools during Flynn’s tenure at PS 193 were sharply critical of her, and in the 2015-16 school survey, Flynn’s ratings

We didn't apply anywhere else. Overall, it's been fine.  Pros: Most of the teachers have been very good, my child is having trouble with math and the teacher this year has been very good about helping me help my child.  I like that the counselors follow the kids through their entire time at school - the class has had the same counselor since 6th grade and they've formed a good bond.  The parent coordinator is very good about responding to email and helping me address any concerns I've had. They organized an in-house high school fair that I found helpful.  There are a lot of opportunities for trips and the trips have been fun. My kid got a lot of music classes (the band teacher and chorus teacher were great) and they have a wonderful dance teacher.  Cons: We still have absolutely no idea how classes are assigned. Initially they said they try to keep all the kids together throughout middle school, but for 7th grade my kid was moved to a different class, and then he was moved again for 8th grade back to his 6th grade class. We never figured out why. We were told that my child was in an honors class, but at this point I suspect that they just tell every parent that their kid is in the ""honors"" class. My kid has a very strong interest in visual art and had absolutely no opportunity whatsoever to take a visual art class. We're trying to get into an art-heavy high school but are now at a serious disadvantage. There have been some enrichment classes of little value - like digital citizenship and some kind of ""invention"" based career readiness course and another computer course that initially sound good but somehow devolved into them watching a bunch of movies by the end of the semester. After-school activities are somewhat limited. Since I work I have very little time to get involved with the PTA - meetings seem to be held during the day. Still, I tried to volunteer a few times and was ignored.

To me so far my 2 years in this school right know (I'm in 7th grade) I have never seen someone getting physically hit at all (which is great!) This school is very good and most kids would be satisfied and say that this is a great school. The teachers and principals are very nice and they help their kids with their problems and everything. Yes there are strict teachers but personally that one strict teacher I had actually helped me and for the first time I got a 4 on my ELA test which I have never gotten before. The teachers take their time to help at their lunch time and some even after school (for a bit). They understand what the students problems and concerns are. Great programs, I had robotics last year which I really enjoyed and had dance and band. I'm currently in Band right know. Many concerts and plays and just makes the students enjoy school more. AMAZING school just to say. Comparing to other schools I have seen this is one of the BEST school that parents should decide sending their 5th grade graduates to and not regret a single thing. So don't wait after reading this. Send you kid to this school because IT ROCKS!",0,0,0,2015-02-22T20:57:07,0.5,0.099,0.153,0.046,0.873,0.068,0.5539999999999999,0.23800000000000002,0.165,0.147,0.43,0.193

A parent writes, ""The CIG program [at JHS 234] is challenging and children must test into it. It has been a mixed bag for us; my daughter is not bored, but is very stressed. The school has kept her class together for all three years. Again, its been good because she has made close friends (both boys and girls) but the same students win the awards year after year, while mixing them up a bit might give someone else a chance to shine. She has qualified for Arista, the honors society, for the past two years, but doesn't want to go to the awards ceremony this year; last year she left in tears because some students get to light candles or make speeches while the rest just sit there. Afterschool help is available if your child is struggling but for a CIG student to go in for it would probably be social suicide. There is sometimes a great deal of homework, even on vacations. Although the school is very large, the Guidance Counselor stays with the class for three years so he does know them, and ours was very helpful with the high school process. She will leave with a High School Regents exam behind her, and high school probably can't be any more pressure than this was.""",1,0,0,2013-03-19T15:57:31,0.5,0.099,0.153,0.046,0.873,0.068,0.5539999999999999,0.23800000000000002,0.165,0.147,0.43,0.193

Best school EVER. 
It multi-cultural , and the teachers are supportive , Theres only two ways to go.. Either You want to pass Or you want to fail. Its easy to decipher those students.The teachers are nice , and even the worst teachers ( You know the mean ones) They actually help you prepare for the next grade. I honestly don't want to leave this school >.< , Once you are accepted here its like your a part of family. Everyone knows your name , You can be the shyest kid ( Like me ) But you'll eventually feel cozy in your environment.

       THERE ARE SO MANY CLUBS!! Like the Drama club cx . ( I'm in it , 2 years running )  And the eighth graders aren't bully's , SO if your scared of that, don't bother.Urmmm... Honestly I think we have a lot of freedom , During lunch ( Which is 45 minutes) You can go to the chorus club , Outside in the yard , Or lounge inside and play some cards.There are two snack machines ( It's all healthhy stuff) And like 5 water machines.But besides all of that...


IF I TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE ALL OF THIS , DON'T YOU THINK THE SCHOOL IS LIKE ASUYHSIFDH; AWESOME? 

Please Join our Cunningham Family, You won't regret it c:

Yes, this school has many problems,but all can be solved and many fights may happen and that isn't the school fault. It's the kids that were all raised differently and have different prespectives on what the argument was about hence why they were fighting. Also you can't judge a school because of its students judge it by how smart the kids are and how the teachers, deans, and the principal deal with problems. Some good thinga about Hudde is that you can meet wonderful people and become great friends and you can learn how to type quickly even when the teacher is yelling. What do you expect for a teacher to do when they have about 28 to 30 kids in a class room? So you may be annoyed with the yelling of teachers and deans, but it could be the same reason your parents or relatives yell and that reason is to make you listen.

In addition, the new principal has brought chess into the school and wrestling.  The school has calmed down significantly compared to years ago.  There is a growing multi-cultural population in the school. The area is pretty safe.  I would advise parents to keep their children away from the Junction (where Flatbush & Nostrand Ave intersect) as it is too busy for middle school students. The immediate area around Hudde is residential with businesses on Nostrand Ave. Parents should always know where their children are.  I recommend this school to concerned parents.

My learning life is much easier. Hudde is the key for me to success. This school is also starting more safer programs as well. The people who say Hudde is a bad school, Hudde is much better than the other years most of these students from last year and beyond! I really want more students to understand our school much better.

22K240,CIGReviewer,brooklyn,Middle,689,"Doesn't matter in what program or grade you're in, this school is not good.
There is frequent altercations (such as fighting) on a weekly basis, and there has been many close encounters of me getting involved.
The classrooms themselves aren't good either. The desks are all filled with gum, candy wrappings, sticky substances, and leftover food. Not to forget to mention that the desks are all scratched up and littered with graffiti.
Staff constantly YELL at students to enforce rules, in which I believe in unnecessary and it shows hostility.
Special Education & Mainstream classes are just downright ridiculous. Yelling, screaming, cursing in the hallways most of the time, trying to grab attention and possibly even cause an altercation.
Not only that, but the teachers aren't even that good when it comes to teaching. Some have ""favorites"" in which won't punish at all or as severely as he/she would punish other students. And the methods of teaching aren't very effective, as many people don't understand and such.
The sanitation in this school is mediocre. You can come in the morning without a problem, but throughout the day, it gets pretty bad. Candy wrappers and bottles on the stairwells, etc. In a rare occasion, you can see a giant cockroach under the heaters in classes.
I've been in the CIG for almost 3 years now, and I haven't seen one MAJOR positive thing in this school.

The Principal does not have control of the school and the students know this and the get away with everything.  Many students in this school cannot read well or do grade appropriate work.  This school needs to be broken down and rebuilt with an administration that can take charge of the school and work with their teachers.  Most teachers at this school are scared to speak out because then know if they do there will be retaliation, and there maybe the lost of their jobs.

22K240,other,brooklyn,Middle,689,"<p>As a former teacher at Hudde Jr. High School I can fully agree with parents when they say the administration at the school is lacking.  O'Sullivan needs to be replaced along with her AP's.  I have witnessed firsthand one AP verbally belittle students and teachers.  The mainstream classes especially the 20s classes cannot complete grade appropriate curricula. I had to modify my lessons to a 5th grade level in order to have the majority of the students understand the material.  The students walk around the halls and there are no consequences established for students who come into class late or who are disrespectful.  As a teacher you can file as many referrals as you like but nothing is done.  The students are in a uniform school and it is not up held by the administrators.  I worked for a school that was a uniformed school and if a student did not come in uniform they were sent home to change and parents were called by either the administrators or by the deans.  The deans are over work\ed. if a fight breaks out in the hallway or in a classroom that is left unlock and no one teaches in that classroom nothing is officially done about it. Reading and Math scores while it is reported as improving. I have seen where testing has gone on and is not up to the mandates of the State. I had students who could not read or whose reading skills were well below average. The gifted and talented program is a joke. While there are students who are in the program who could do actual gifted and talented work, others are in there just because they know how to behave in a classroom. The school needs to be broken down and restructured starting at the top which is O'Sullivan. If you do not cover up what is wrong with the school or help cover up the many violent problems in the school, you as a teacher are harassed and found unsatisfactory no matter how many things you do for the school and students.</p>",0,0,0,2010-04-05T21:42:56,0.5,0.17,0.20600000000000002,0.073,0.5379999999999999,0.128,0.701,0.161,0.575,0.163,0.086,0.19899999999999998
22K240,parent,brooklyn,Middle,689,"Our son had some excellent teachers, but the overall environment of the school was awful - kids running through the halls, School Safety Agents screaming at the kids, and the kids screaming back, kids breaking light fixtures, etc. In the 3 years my son was there, he never had any specific problems, and made some wonderful friends, but if I had it to do over, I'd never send him there.

My son had some specific emotional/academic problems having nothing to do with the school, and we received next to no help from the guidance counselor or other staff. Many of his teachers were great, and went the extra mile to work with him, but the guidance counselor very candidly told us that his problems were nothing compared to the other problems she was dealing with. Luckily, we had the resources to deal with his issues on our own, but I don't know what we would have done if we couldn't afford to.

<p>The CIG program used to be the gold standard for gifted and talented middle school students. Kids from the brownstone neighborhoods used to charter buses to come to Hudde. That was in the past. The program was very watered down, the famous Johns Hopkins Math program was eliminated, the classes got larger, etc. The District de-funded the program. The parent coordinator is, well, she didn't even attend the first orientation meeting we attended, or most of the other parent meetings. What does that tell you? The only reason we didn't transfer our son out was that he had lots of friends, some wonderful teachers, and due to some of the emotional issues he had, transfer to a new school would have made things worse for him, even if it was a better school.</p>",0,0,0,2010-03-09T20:46:31,0.5,0.17,0.20600000000000002,0.073,0.5379999999999999,0.128,0.701,0.161,0.575,0.163,0.086,0.19899999999999998

I even graduated as valedictorian and was on the Yearbook Committee. It was really fun. I think that the best thing to do to be a good student is to accept everything, ask questions, don't be afraid to be curious, and try to be active in activities, like after school, extended day, and school events (dances, sports, etc.). Teachers are very fair, and they DO encourage thinking out of the box creativity. When I used to be in Pre-K and Kindergarten, sure, it was kind of hard to accept everything, like being given a role in school, such as attendance monitor, or participating in class. Good students were not those who ""sit still and remain quiet in class"", I actually did that for a year, and only turned out to be the invisible person, not even a good student because you actually get conduct comments for that. But, if you are curious, and attentive, most likely you will be successful in the P.S.255 society. The teachers are fair, gentle, and polite about everything, they don't scream, they just wait, and everyone gets the idea that someone has done something wrong. Students admit, and realize their mistakes. The faculty encourages kids to think out of the box, and try to look at things in positive ways, and different points of views. I think that P.S.255 is truly a great school to go to, and heck, there are many opportunities for long lasting bonds and friendships with teachers, and friends. Across the street is Cunningham, an outstanding middle school that most kids from P.S.255 attend, where friendships continue and blossom. Also, there is a nearby high school about 10 minutes away, where the friendships from middle school continue.

While I am glad to read that the school is no longer over crowded and that the students attend full days of classes, the facility has to be very old. PS 137 was ancient back in the fifties.

The students and the community deserve some modernization. 
The world has changed a great deal since I went to school there, the facilities change to meet the challenges of teaching in such an information centric environment. While I agree that a school is comprised of much more than brick and mortar, a facility designed with more current imperatives could benefit both the faculty and the students, alike.

Majority of the office staff is very inappropriate at times, snapping publically at students and parents for no reason at all, cursing and making mature jokes around students and parents. The school lunches are often still frozen when presented to the students (reported by MANY MANY kids on a very REGULAR basis). Students aren't given a chance to explain themselves if ""caught"" doing something and are often penalized without parent notification. A LOT of the programs listed in this article are non existent but will be resurrected for newspapers or internet articles and then dropped again leaving students confused. There isn't adequate spacing in the lunchrooms. Bathrooms are filthy on a DAILY BASIS. Teachers and faculty often dig up and find ways to reward themselves with city money, taking trips for themselves and often going the FULL SCHOOL YEAR without incorporating trips for students. Educational and recreational programs are dropped mid year. Students aren't allowed to express themselves artistically as stated in the article. Art work displayed in the halls are 3-4 years old and are left there to provide an illusion of steady projects. The arts programs, if any are an ""elite"" group of the SAME students and are not open to new students to participate. An example of that is the DRUMMING PROGRAM mentioned in this article.

23K184,Maryse Pagnard,brooklyn,K-8,506,"As an excessed teacher (ATR), I have had the opportunity to work throughout the Brownsville/Oceanhill district as a substitute. Many of the schools are deemed underperforming through no fault of their own: they are plagued by lack of funding, severe social issues, as well as lack of parental support. Day in and day out, teachers strive to do their best to educate but are met with many challenges. In the meantime, charter schools are taking over the public schools and the already struggling population of students are shuffled into neighboring schools, thereby putting further strains on the resources of those schools. There seems to be little hope left for the public schools in this area.However, there is a small gem of a school in the southern part of the district. PS184 was noticeably different. The first thing that struck me upon entering the building was that the Student of the Month pictures were actually in frames on the wall. Everywhere I looked throughout the building, I saw no evidence of the usual graffiti on the walls. The school itself is quite old with the beautiful and unusual characteristics of a building from that era, however the inside was spotlessly clean with everything working as if this was a new building. It was quite apparent that the custodial staff took pride in maintaining the school in tip top condition.The teachers were hardworking, devoted, and professional. They took a genuine concern in their students and the camaraderie between the staff was evident.The students were polite and eager to learn. They took enormous pride in everything they did.The principal, Mr. Lamson Lam, is a very calm, approachable, and inquisitive individual. He takes great interest in any ideas offered for improvements to his school. It is obvious that he wants nothing but success for his school, his students, and his teachers. He ends every announcement on the PA system with the following phrase: "" PS184, a place where the teachers want to teach, students want to learn, and parents want to help.""I truly believe it.",1,0,0,2012-03-06T03:49:19,0.75,0.04,0.29600000000000004,0.17600000000000002,0.92,0.21899999999999997,0.877,0.002,0.7,0.273,0.012,0.478

23K392,Tami G.,brooklyn,Middle,307,"My daughter just graduated June 2015 and her attending I.S. 392 was truly an unexpected blessing. Four years prior to submitting her application my son attended I.S. 383 Philippa Schuyler School for the Gifted and Talented and I had more negative experiences with that school than positive; don't get me wrong the school was OK at that moment in time when my son attended, but based off that experience with my son I had a far better understanding of the kind of school environment I did not want for my daughter.

At I.S. 392 my husband and I found the right school environment we were searching for our daughter.  From the moment you walk into the school building you are greeted by NYC's #1 school safety officers who are dedicated, firm when they need to be, nurturing and extremely attentive to all the children (as they know so many by name).  Being known by name and not an ID number is a definite component of the ideal school environment I envision for my children.  I.S. 392 is a small school with a
couple hundred students that shares 2 floors of the clean and vibrant school
building with an elementary school (***kudos to the janitorial staff***).  The school administration and staff are dedicated and nurturing with strong and supportive leadership from the school’s principal Ms. Joseph.  

The academic standards and uniform policies are highly enforced; academics can be closely monitored by parents through an online resource (pupilpath.skedula.com) that is frequently updated with grades (classwork, homework, project, quiz, test) and frequent communications from the school administration and teachers.  I.S. 392 also offers MANY afterschool opportunities and even free summer programs for their students; as a parent who was unable to afford dance (ballet, tap, modern,
African, hip-hop), photography, African drumming, vocal, theatre, violin…it was

This school is really just one big community. The teacher are kind and respectful, if treated with respect and give a fair work load. It prepares you for high school and even college. The teachers try to push you to your full potential. And for for the people who say this school is ""ghetto"", it really isn't. If you compare this school to some of the other schools in the area, there is a GAINT difference. Everyone is friends with everyone, there are really ever fights and with all the different programs this school offers, their is something for everyone.

The dances are really fun and they are not disgusting. Many kids dance like that today and if you don't like it, don't come. And we do use the dance studio such as the 5th graders for ballroom dance.

It's much bigger. Our school, had a budget cut, which actually made the 8th grade classes become bigger. Our school barely have fights, and it's actually quite orderly. Our bathrooms,are not dirty. Unless kids are using the ones on the floors below us. I got to admit, yeah the principal, may get in your face, but however, that shouldn't be a problem, if your child rarely get in trouble.Kids here say these things because they like those schools where they can do whatever they want. We're a magnet school, not some type of normal school. We have many after school programs. For being in after school, they took us out to see Sister Act in broad way, for being on the honor roll, they took us out to see Lion King. Trust me those tickets are a lot.  We have dance after-school, ceramics, photograph. Many more. Each year the 8th grade performs a show. Which is actually written by the students. We have 7 classes. Each homework is due on each day. Going to this school, can help you learn a lot, then what an average middle school teachers.

And also when there is poor leadership like a principal that doesn't take their job seriously a lot of corruption happens. And that is what happened at 332. And its sad to see my childhood school such as 332 go down like that because of Ms. Pierce lack of responsibility. Now 332 is down to only 1 floor. The Charter school needs to go.

Over the course of 7 months there have been over 12 fights at that school and 5 major lock downs! And I can guarantee you that when I saw fights break out all the security guards did was stand there and wither watch or laugh then wait at least a few seconds in to actually brake it up! 
-Students at this school are unhappy with the time they have spent here or are currently spending here, It has been said by many students that they would rather be left back at there old school than to have to come to this school!  They have said that the environment that they have to be in is so horrible that they'd rather never come back! One student has been slapped, Bullied and constantly picked on by other and all the school did was tell her to cheer up and that she will get over it!! They never talked to the bullies or further pursue the issue they just let it go and to this day all this girls talks about is wanting to kill herself and the teacher hear and do !NOTHING! 

You may ask what my goal is with this review, my goal is to save your kid from ever having to got through this horrible experience! The time they'd spend here they could spend at a school that cares about their emotional and physical health!

23K518,Rjjrayray1,brooklyn,Middle,196,"I've been a student at Kappa V under the care and protection of former Principal Anthony Shepherd. Honestly, Ever since he left that school, it started to go down hill. It will never be the same. It's impossible because no one can be like him and no one can discipline his students like him. That man was fired because he wanted to make a difference in his students even the ones that used to give the most trouble. He didn't want us to go out into the World with a bad reputation,  bad mentality and character. Ever since I graduated from KAPPA V, I became more responsible and more wiser. He was teaching us to be leaders and not followers. He was more than just a principal, he was a father to a lot who was fatherless. Yes he was strict but that's what you call a principal. They will have to be strict sometime. When you don't stand your ground , how can you be respected. It was ridiculous to see how many students disrespected him. It showed me that they didn't have any home training. Without him, I don't know what I would've done when I finished junior high. His motivation alone inspired me to become motivated. He was a man of his word. He wouldn't make promises he cant keep. It really amazed me to see how many parents and students of the graduating class after us hated him so much to accuse him of things he didn't even do. All of those rumors that I was hearing, I didn't appreciate it at all. It was so disgusting. All of those scavengers and crows picking at an innocent man that was only doing his job. I guarantee that if the board or whoever was to call all of the parents and students of my graduating class, he would be a principal again no doubt. I don't care what others think of him but I know that he was the best of the best and Principle Dellie Edwards will never take his place because he was the heart of KAPPA V, without the heart being there, there's no heartbeat. I apologize if someone feels offended  but I have the freedom of speech and I'm standing on my own two feet. I'm heading off to college with an Advanced Regents Diploma. I WAS IN THE GRADUATING CLASS OF 2007  AND I WILL PROUDLY SAY "" LEAD OR GET OUT THE WAY, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR YOUR SUCCESS, I AM DOING IT!!!""  THANKS TO FORMER PRINCIPAL ANTHONY SHEPHERD KNOWN AS COMMANDANT SHEPHERD.

i also appreciate the extra focus on improving reading and writing skills that the eighth grade provides, and parent-teacher night is very informative- most of the teachers can demonstrate the learning level the child entered class with, and the growth that has taken place since then. this school provides scholar and family support which i think is necessary for a successful student. the discipline is also excellent for young boys that have a high enery level. i have seen mr. meade go into a lunchroom full of busy children and say- I AM- and the children know to respond ""globally conscious and globally competitive."" it is wonderful to see the respect that most of the children have for their teachers and principal, which is rare these days. this school is a good combination of order and discipline balanced with strong academics and afterschool activities. and the five pm dismissal means my son is not traveling with the general school population at three o'clock. overall, i am very grateful for this school.",0,0,0,2012-01-30T14:26:34,1.0,0.0,0.325,0.017,0.9179999999999999,0.19899999999999998,0.647,0.0,0.88,0.096,0.0,0.17300000000000001
23K644,M. Aponte,brooklyn,Middle,292,"I Am A Proud Parent of An Eagle Scholar.   During the three years that my son has attended Eagle, I have seen a great deal of improvement in my son, not only in his educational confidence but in his emotional, social growth.    Another important factor that Eagle stresses is respect for yourself and others.  Respect, of course, begins with the parents at home but respect for educators and authority must also be instilled.  As parents we all have to work together not against each other, to resolve any problem we feel is affecting our child’s educational progress. Our sons, being minorities, will confront many things that will try to hold them back.  Some are faced with various obstacles which impede on their educational progress in their neighborhood, at home, etc.    The first thing we have to do is come together to protect our children’s education which is now being threatened by cuts in teaching staff, school funding for education programs, Title I programs which help our at risk students, schools being shut down,  funding for community services and afterschool programs for students, and summer youth employment programs, etc.  If we, as parents, do not come together to protect our children’s educational rights, we will soon be faced by problems faced in the 1970’s in education which include teacher layoffs, overcrowded classrooms and sub-standard education  for our children.  Parents need to get involved.  Our children have a right to receive a quality and well-rounded education and this is the new Civil Rights movement we need to keep sight of.  We need to come together not only for our children, but for those who fought for those Civil Rights for us in the past. 

We, as parents, do have a voice in our child’s education.    Let’s use our voices respectfully and with dignity not belittling or negatively.   All parent concerns matter.  Together, with positive action, we can resolve issues that we feel are affecting our scholars.  You chose Eagle for a reason.  Parent involvement is a strong requirement of an Eagle Scholars Education.  We have to work together to help improve all the educational conditions that affect the students citywide.   It really does take a village to raise a child and caring not just about our own child but all children is what matters most.   We need to help each other as much as we can in whatever capacity we have to give.  As parents we are the first line of defense in our children’s lives.  Their first educational and ethical values are learned from us, the parents.   Parents, be honest and ask yourselves the following questions:  Do you know what your child is learning at school? Do you know all your children’s teachers by name?  Do you attend the Parent /Teacher conferences, PTA meetings, SLT meetings, Community Education Council meetings, parent workshops?  What do I know about Title I and how does it affect my child?   Are you volunteering in any respect at your child’s school?  Do I  help out in my child’s school in any capacity? Do I volunteer my talents to my childs school? Do I address my issues to the Principal, Guidance Counselor, Parent Coordinator, Social Worker, or District Family Advocate?

We do not want our children to fail but want them all to succeed.  Let’s get together to make sure that we as parents receive the resources we need to help our children succeed.  We need to make sure our children receive a high quality and well-rounded education  that will help carry them throughout their lives.  Parent involvement is a key to student success.

Probably in ""Tony's"" day none of these groups were considered ""white"". It's hard to not sense a value judgement in his description and not to bridle at that. Stemming from before the 1930s, white was considered Caucasian (and if you recall the politics of the Nazi era, white was also considered ""good""). If, and this is problematic, one were to use the same construct, Italians, Greeks, and people from Baghdad were all loosely classified as Caucasian. The idea of Caucasian as white is deeply flawed pseudoscience from the mid-19th century (See the New Yorker article called The Hidden Past of Sochi). Recent genetic tests have underlined how political boundaries are ropes that tie very different peoples together. Iraq, Greece, and Italy, contain people that often descend from different haplogroups--or shared genetic ancestry. In the past, Irish and Britons have been considered prime examples of ""white"" and ""Caucasian."" That's interesting, because most Irish and Britons we now know are descendants of farmers who left Iraq some 10,000 years ago. In other words, those quintessential ""white"" people are, in Tony's lingo from ""Baghdad."" Race it seems exists in our imagination, and changes according to what we believe.

24Q016,lexi,queens,Elementary,1509,"I graduated in 2010 and personally i thought 
the school was pretty okay. It kept you busy in the afternoon with 
afternoon clubs, which was really cool. The school offered many 
opportunities, using connections, to allow students to experience 
ballroom dancing, ballet, and allowed many classes to participate in 
themed shows. The staff at the school was really nice as well. I do 
believe the school can improve and corrects it's small flaws, such as overcrowding, more diversity amongst the  schools population and more discipline even more than what they have now, but besides
 that i do believe it's worth enrolling into. Remember not every school is perfect, schools in general  can't control their population due to residential circumstances, and the amount of children that are enrolling into public school. Also if for any reason you think the school is terrible due to the way kids treat you, don't fault the school system and staff for that because it's not their fault. They can't control what people think about you, and react towards you. if you were smart enough you would bring it up to your teacher, assistant principal, or guidance counselor, and allow them to take the steps needed to resolve the situation. When i was at this school the staff was very cooperative and helpful when it came to situations like this. Bullying happens every where and the only thing you can do if it happens to you or if you witness it, is to bring it up to an official. Now i am in Louis 
Armstrong Middle School, and I'm going to high school next semester

Another down fall about this school is that students are asked to line up outside when it's 30 degree weather.

If you child is a little behind in anything they will never catch up here. They get lost. I am not just some angry parent making up bad reviews. It's true. Like the mom below wrote about kids walking around the building to meet their parents and being yelled at in the office it's all true. ,11,0,0,2012-03-25T13:59:59,0.75,0.066,0.165,0.039,0.9670000000000001,0.053,0.306,0.19399999999999998,0.011000000000000001,0.23800000000000002,0.539,0.113

Mr.Lombardi focuses on the arts and music, incorporating it into everyday lessons. He knows all of us by name and personally goes over each test we take and writes comments on them. This school is a major advantage to those graduating and moving on to High Schol. The exiting at the end is very hectic at some degree but considering how many children attend the school, is very organized. There is now presently a gym and for the 7-8th grade now a green club, karate club, will be after school gym program, senior trips, soon to be yearbook club committe and many more clubs. I am very grateful to be going to a school so inspiring and serious in learning. I hope everyone elses experience will be the same as mine.

24Q049,Parent,queens,K-8,1204,"Overall, this is a great school with strong academics. I am very happy with the education my children have received, and they are well-rounded, as they are exposed to lots of music and technology as well. They now have Science and Phys Ed teachers, which is great. Teachers are wonderful and there are lots of extra-curricular programs like band, string-program, chess club, newspaper, robotics. Test prep is important for State Tests and kids that need extra help, are invited to attend Saturday mornings. Principal does run a tight ship, but he cares about the kids and is accessible to parents. PTA is amazing.
On the down-side, there's a new math curriculum that not all parents are too happy with, it's experimental, but the principal is sticking by it. Accelerated math has continued with upper grades, but discontinued for lower grades which put those kids in a disadvanage, since they're redoing math from over a year ago. The office does not seem the most welcoming place. If you're late to pick up, or you have to sign out your child early, they may get really annoyed which is uncomfortable for parents. Ofcourse there's the mean lunchroom lady who loves to scream at kids and not too nice, but my kids will survive. Once in a while, she's nice.
My pros for this school outweigh the cons, and my kids love going to school, so I do recommend PS/IS 49.",2,0,0,2011-02-09T17:24:00,0.75,0.066,0.165,0.039,0.9670000000000001,0.053,0.306,0.19399999999999998,0.011000000000000001,0.23800000000000002,0.539,0.113

24Q049,parent,queens,K-8,1204,"<p>The school makes 9 year olds (4th grade) to go around the school looking for their parents / guardians. The school also does not like when the students are in the office waiting for there parents, if parents are late. Many times my daughter would get yelled at when she goes to the office to wait for me. A school should be the safest place for kids, but my daughter feels disrespected by some people in the school especially one of the school aids.  Someone needs to take actions regarding this matter. A Child age 9 should not be let out for dismissal alone. NYC laws states that a child who is under 14 should not be left alone at home, so I believe that same rules should be implemented as far as school dismissals at PS 49. CHILDREN AGE 9 SHOULD NOT BE LET ALONE DURING DISMISSAL. THEY SHOULD NOT BE TOLD TO GO AROUND THE SCHOOL TO FIND THERE PARENTS / GUARDIANS - SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING..

I recently went to the office to sign my 7 year old out early.  I waited quite a while for him to come to the office.  So I went to look for him and found the school aide repremanding him for going outside of the school to look for me instead of going to the office.  He's 7 years old and I believe its the teacher and schools responsibility to make sure our children are safe.  I think children that young need supervision and someone should have walked him to the office.  You're absolutely right when you say someone needs to do something.  I also don't like the way they'll dismiss your child to anybody as long as your child says they know the person.  Anyone can pickup your child from school and that is very scary.  ,5,0,1,2011-06-22T23:29:42,0.75,0.066,0.165,0.039,0.9670000000000001,0.053,0.306,0.19399999999999998,0.011000000000000001,0.23800000000000002,0.539,0.113

There is no stability for the teachers since they are moved from one grade to another year after year. How are they to improve their lesson plans for our children when they have to make up a new lesson plans each year because they are teaching another grade level. One year, a teacher will be teaching in the 6th grade and the next year, the 2nd grade. Let the teachers stay in the grade they are teaching so they can develope and improve their lesson plans each year and the test scores should improve (something that Tripoli wants so badly, yet isn't happening with the way she is moving the teachers around). You will never see her at the school greeting the kids or out in the schoolyard in the morning. If you are a parent with a child in kindergarten or 1st grade, you will see Principal Tripoli driving into her usual parking spot when you are walking your child to the blue door. I can say I have only seen Principal Tripoli in the schoolyard in the morning ONCE, that's ONCE in 3 years time. You will not see Principal Tripoli at the student of the month assemblies to encourage the kids at all. The principal is also very condescending to the parents. The Principal's Homework she gives the students are a joke. This year's 2nd graders were given poems to decipher that were too deep for them to even understand. Case in point, they were given ""Heal the World"" as their first assignment. The kids can learn Italian, but there are no homework assignment and I really don't any of the work they do in class for it. Each year, you are forced to do the parent survey before you are allowed to see your child's teacher. Last year, I was able to do it online, however, this year I was not even given that option. I have a couple of friends whose kids were bullied and Principal Tripoli did nothing to remedy the situation. One friend had to go to the district in order to get any help. Another friend's child is being placed in the same class with the kids who bullied him year after year for 4 years now.

When these words were said it helped me to remember that if we worked hard we could ... achieve anything we ever wanted to.""",0,0,0,2005-02-28T21:17:02,0.75,0.128,0.16,0.049,0.9640000000000001,0.057,0.531,0.39899999999999997,0.006,0.4,0.182,0.122

We were looking for a school that offered collaborative team teaching. Luckily for us, PS 58Q offered it. Another school in the area offered it too, but I chose PS 58Q based on the wonderful comments I received from both parents and students that attend the school."" She continues: ""At the time of this writing, the school year is half over, and I am amazed at what my son has accomplished so far. The teachers work with the parents to help the children. The PTA. is [composed] of a great group of parents. They work closely with the principal, the teachers, the staff, and the parents. [The school has] a wonderful open-door policy. In this school, the principal knows your name and your child's name just because they attend the school, not because they've ever had to 'go down to the principal's office' if they were misbehaving. Everyone in that building has one goal in mind: to help the children. You can't ask for more than that.""",0,0,0,2005-02-28T21:15:07,0.75,0.128,0.16,0.049,0.9640000000000001,0.057,0.531,0.39899999999999997,0.006,0.4,0.182,0.122
