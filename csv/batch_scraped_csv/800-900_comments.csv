I have been attending P.s 200 since pre-k and all of my siblings went or go there too. Throughout all these years I still have no complaints. The only complaint I have is that it is not a high school. I have made so many friends in that school including some best friends.  Whenever I was upset my teachers would know and they would help me through my problems, wether it was drama or stress from school. P.s 200 isn't a school it is a family and I would do anything to go back. P.s 200 is a school where every teacher knows your name and every teacher cares. I have bonded with all of my teachers and will miss all of them personal. I will even miss the teachers that I didn't have the pleasure to study with because no matter what all the teachers would check up on you. P.s 200 was amazing academic wise and extra curricular wise. I was never bored in that school. I was always looking forward to something, wether it was all of our amazingly fun assemblys, all the fun battle of the classes, the teacher verses student sports tournaments or the drama and music classes. P.s 200 is a place to explore your interests, every Friday we would have a free period to join a club, wether it was school photography, writing, leaning through media or drama it was always fun. I was in school spirit and photography and media, I always had a blast wether it was helping out at bake sales, creating posters, creating inspiring videos using all the diverse children in our school or cutting out paper hearts. All of the teachers inspire the students to work hard to achieve their goals. Even if that student showed no interest at all the teachers would not give up.

I can tell you one thing: this school has it's ups and downs over the years, just as almost every other school, but we have been better because of it. 
I enjoyed my many years at this school as a whole, and this school does an incredibly great job at making you feel welcomed and part of a family. 
The principal Mr.McAulliffe has honestly been the best principal our school has experienced and had in the years I attended here. He has brought about positive change and I can honestly say that our school is now headed to a brighter future. 
There are some teachers that may have problems with a lot of students, and in all honesty, there are some teachers here that are just plan nasty, rude for no reason, etc;
However, there are many teachers here at this school that I can count at the top of y head whom are incredibly great people and are teachers I have grown close to. 
The teachers and staff here really do care about a child's well being and education, and I cannot stress that enough. 
The education here is great, and the effort the teachers put in for making sure their student understands the material, is outstanding and is always helpful. I found myself graduating this school with a confidence in my education and a confidence about my future that being at this school has caused for me entirely. 
I'm currently a freshman in high school, and I still honestly miss this school and the great people that are there. 
I'm grateful to have been a part of the great class of 2015 at this school.
There's many fun activities planned at this school and I have memories of so many fun yet educational fundraisers and activities this school has put together in the past, and from what I hear, they still do.

25Q237,andy,queens,Middle,1377,"Alright, let me just tell you something now. I see these positive comments which were obviously left by staff who want something from their boss, and I'll just give you an actual look in on this school.

Well, there's a lot of bullying, the principal is demanding and the deans are willing to get you into trouble for absolutely anything. The dress code may seem glamorous at first but once you realize how meaningless to people who want to dress different it really is, you see the former in action. I remember getting in detention seriously just for the dean not being able to identify the color of my pants when they were so clearly black, as the dress code demands. The teachers are not motivational at all, they either give you a lot of homework or give you nearly nothing. And the latter is definitely present in lazy teachers. If you're not in an honors class (with people who don't deserve it whatsoever of course!) you're basically treated with so much disrespect. I was lucky enough to be in them all my 3 years, but seeing other kids being maltreated just for not meeting the school's scores is outrageous. The houses are made a big deal of, yet we barely even touch on them. Walking through the school feels unsafe, and you're constantly prone to being tripped or being screamed at by some bigot trying to scare you. The other intelligent kids are usually bullies, give or take 3 of them. I do not recommend this school, there is so much stress and negativity that comes with it. Save yourself and your grades and appeal as soon as possible. Don't let them deal with this.",0,0,0,2015-03-11T23:10:58,0.5,0.20800000000000002,0.12300000000000001,0.031,0.591,0.052000000000000005,0.6509999999999999,0.779,0.05,0.149,0.013000000000000001,0.12

The school occupied almost the entire fourth floor of the school, causing overcrowding and clashing among the students of both 237 and East/West. As for the quality of education at the school, I was in one of the honors classes and was challenged far more than the other students and still managed to keep my grades in the 90s.

Most of that information was before we switched principals. After switching principals, we do have recess outside when its warm and if the class behavior is appropriate. Its located in a very quiet neighborhood but it still has a few convenience stores a block or two away. Even though we don't have a community service program anymore, the school still participates in many events that give back to the community. Many teachers actually care about your academic goals and the principal does make rounds to the classroom every couple weeks to regulate the lessons. Personally, I don't think the teachers show favoritism unlike the comments posted below. Especially the comment about our gym teacher. I absolutely disagree with this. I have no athletic skill whatsoever. But, I change into PhysEd uniform during every class, I try my best and I still receive an astounding grade of 90 in the class. Also, the comment about our biology teacher, I actually think he teaches us a lot. He may tell a lot of jokes but that's just to keep everyone engaged into lesson. Because the school has a small population of around 350-360, all the students receive the individual attention. Most teachers know my name and I like that a lot.

25Q281,Adam Lu,queens,Middle,297,"Today I visited the East West School of International Studies, not as their student but as their alumni. I visited on a day that I have only seen offered by East West. The first Friday of every month, the school allows parents the opportunity to come observe their child’s class by following their day. They come in when the students start school, muster, to second period. I came in as the brother of my younger sister to see what her classes are like and how they differ when I attended. The first class I visited was my younger sister’s social studies class and I came to one of the most fascinating class I ever attended. The students were learning about the Vietnam War and the teacher brought in a person that lived through that time period and had firsthand experience of the war and the journey of a refuge. I loved that the teacher brought in a living piece of history to have a different style of teaching a topic. College was always about lectures, learning from the textbook and almost never bringing in an actual person to learn from a different angle.

The second class I visited was my sister’s health class. The environment that was created by the teacher seemed to keep a very open discussion about touchy health topics. Many of these topics within the health class were taboo within a family setting and many parents feel uncomfortable talking about it. The teacher created an healthy environment where kids can be speak their opinions about a topics and not be judged.

Overall, I have to say the school is a step up of what it used to be when I attended 5 years ago. I am proud to say I graduated from this school and can’t imagine how any other school can match East West’s growth and commitment to a child’s education.

25Q281,S Fahie,queens,Middle,297,"One Moment in East-West

High School is all about self-discovery. As I end my four-year journey, I have taken a few moments to sit back and reflect on what I have learned here at East-West. High School is that influence that helps one to examine oneself and to become a better person for the future. High School is the driving force, the transition from the person you once were, to the person you desire to become. No school accomplishes that more than East-West.

East-West helped me to open my shell and break down the walls I had built up over the years. From 7th grade to present day, I’ve grown to assert myself and stand firm to the ideas I believe in. This transition has helped to mold my personality. I am now an independent, ambitious, curious and outgoing young woman. I am eternally grateful to my past teachers and to my principal, Mr. Sherman, who have helped shape me into becoming who I am today.

East-West was only a small portion of the 4th floor when I arrived back in 2007. Yes, we are a small school and I am grateful that I was able to accomplish so much during my junior high and high school years. I was able to get to know many of my teachers as well as establishing a relationship with the school staff. From 8th grade to 12th grade, my teachers have seen and influenced me to grow from a shy student to a confident, bright young woman. My teachers have helped me into becoming not only a better student but a better person with morals and ethics.

However, what I enjoyed the most about attending this school was making so many friends from different ethnicities. This only fulfills the idea of East-West being so international. We are a diverse community; I’m friends with Asians, Whites and Hispanics. They have all given me opportunities to learn about their cultures. Over the years we’ve become a small family where I have embraced various cultures during my years of East-West.

Throughout the years I participated in so many school-wide events such as the 2010 Talent Show, the 1st and 3rd Annual Poetry Slam and other extracurricular activities that have helped me sharpen my interests and hobbies. In these events and clubs I’ve learned to express myself through song, writing and in my beliefs.

East-West has also challenged me to take difficult courses in order to challenge myself and better prepare myself for college curriculum. English AP was indeed a challenging course to take, however, the experience has made me stronger and more willing to take on more challenges. I am also appreciative that I was able to partake in so many first time events in East-West such as having our first Chemistry and English AP Classes as well as signing our Rachel’s Challenge banner which creates a zero-tolerance bullying zone and promotes the virtues of compassion and kindness in our school.

Both courses have not only accomplished my desire in taking challenging courses but have prepared me for college. While taking the English AP Course, I was required to write essays in MLA format and was graded on a college level scale. The topics ranged from modern education to argumentative essays where we were required to have a counterargument and analyze our evidence. East-West also has given me the opportunity to experience another college course in Queens College in a program known as College Now.

Another course I was able to take was the Chinese Language Course, that East-West offers for it’s students. From their first year of East-West, students are able to choose from the three Asian language courses offered: Chinese, Japanese and Korean. After taking Chinese for 4 years, I’m proud to say that I’ve learned more about Chinese language as well as Chinese culture (such as cooking, painting and calligraphy). This course has also prepared me for college as well as prepared me for my trip to China during the Summer of 2012.

As a high school senior, I am planning to go to St. John’s University in the Fall and majoring in the Pharmacy Program. Looking back towards the last six years, East-West has had a lasting influence on my life and has provided me with the morals, ethics and the intellect to assist me in the near future. East-West has never given up on me and has pushed me in doing the best I can by encouraging me to challenge myself and to be the best I can be. I will cherish for the rest of my life the good friends I made here at East-West, and the unforgettable lessons I have experienced.",0,0,0,2013-08-12T18:39:24,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05
25Q281,CDraga,queens,Middle,297,"Making the
decision as to which high school Ashley would attend after graduation from
East-West School of International Studies’ middle school was not difficult. She
had already made up her mind that she will continue at East-West.  She had given me every reason to go along,
notably the school’s commitment to excellence. I was comfortable with her
choice, if only for the fact she would not have to change school.



I am very satisfied with Ashley’s academic accomplishments. To be sure, Ashley has always been a good learner, a student
with a high level of achievement motivation, who tends to attribute her
successes (or failures) to her own efforts or actions. But she herself makes
the point that she has been fortunate to have “real good” teachers, the ones
with consistent interest in their students’ learning and progress,  the ones who, as they say, teach from the
heart, not only from the book. It’s a good feeling when a teacher shows
appreciation of parents’ readiness to be actively involved in their children
education. High expectations for student academic success are linked
significantly to direct parents contact with schools. This is why I never
missed school meetings. 



Ashley’s educational journey will in
not too distant a future take a new turn, as she transitions to college. This
by all accounts is a stressful event, physically, mentally, and emotionally- a lengthy
process that involves multiple tasks, requiring time management,
resourcefulness, steadfast supportiveness of home and school.  Like most college applicants Ashley experienced
spikes in anxiety and felt an intense pressure to comply with deadlines. She
commented, however, that consistent support had been available throughout.  She very much enjoyed her trips to Yale and
Columbia campuses, among others. These trips were relevant to the process as
important steps of achieving perspective taking.



Parents
frequently express hope that their children are happy and fulfilled at school,
both in their learning and socialization. In this respect, it is satisfying
that East-West offer a range of program activities for the students to develop
their social skills, showcase their talents and interests, and achieve their
strivings. Some activities are intercultural, while others are
culture-specific, such as judo, Korean painting, dancing, and singing. 



East-West also deserves praise for recognizing
how beneficial it is to encourage a spirit of volunteerism, to develop
citizenship skills in our young adolescents that in turn help to strengthen
community functioning. The aim is that they will eventually translate knowledge
and experiences acquired within the community to a wider world. 



East-West’s student population is ethnically
diverse. Cultural differences notwithstanding, there is no reported intergroup conflict,
a testimony to the quality of East-West leadership.  American born of Haitian descent, Ashley has a
long history of immersion in East Asian cultures, especially Korean, dating
back to her pre-school years.     



Besides being a dedicated member of
the dance team, Ashley is involved in a Korean tutoring program, tutoring
younger children, as well as classmates. She is also an active member of “Model
United Nations” club. Participation in Model United Nations has enlarged her
world view, providing her with insight as to how some of the complex issues
could be solved.  An issue of great
concern to her is Human Rights, especially for children. Ashley’s communication
and problem-solving skills have markedly improved as a result of her
involvement in these programs.  



Looking back, Ashley’s enrollment at
East-West was a right choice. Interactions with the school personnel could not
have been better. I held high expectations for my daughter’s academic success,
and East-West has been instrumental in making it come through. Perhaps more
important, it has given her the sense of purpose and direction. As someone said
quite appropriately, “The purpose of life is a life of purpose.”



As Ashley prepares to exit high
school and take her place in adult society, this is the time, my time, to
rejoice, and to say to you, “East-West educators, job well done. Thank you for
your time.” ",2,0,0,2013-02-21T19:04:17,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05

25Q281,S_Ramirez,queens,Middle,297,"East-West is a very unique school.  When I first came to this school, I was quiet and didn't know who to talk to or who to hang out with.  However, when the students and the teachers came up to me and started talking to me, I felt more at home.  The languages that were offered were very different.  The typical language in high school is Spanish or French.  Yet in this school, we have the option to learn Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.  These are some of the things that make East-West unique.

I think this school is great.  I say this because without East-West and its language options, I would have never gone to South Korea and Japan.  I took Korean in middle school and EWSIS students, myself included, had the opportunity to visit South Korea.  The rules over there are much stricter than in the U.S.  However I liked it because there was no litter anywhere, people were respectful, nobody was loud, the country, the mountains, old fashion houses, were beautiful.  We all had an amazing time; some of us didn't want to come back to the States.  South Korea was a great experience.

Now Japan was a life changing experience  The country is beautiful and the people are very respectful.  Everybody there has respect for each other.  Here in New York, the buses are loud and are filled with screaming bunches of teenage kids doing stupid stuff.  In Japan, the buses were quiet and the trains were extremely quiet, you could hear a pin drop.  Japanese people keep to themselves.  For example, if you put your wallet down and walk away and watch it, nobody will take it because it is not theirs, and it has nothing to do with their life, so they keep on walking.  My host family in Japan was very nice and they taught me some words and phrases, taught me how to use chopsticks better, joked with me, and they always had a smile on their face.  They made me look at life differently.  Japan changed my lifestyle.  I life differently and I act differently.

Because of South Korea, Japan, East-West, the teachers and my parents, I have been able to go to these countries and the fact that I can speak a little Korean and Japanese is even better.  I can cherish this in my life.  This is why I think this school, East-West School of International Studies, is a unique and great school.",5,0,0,2012-08-31T12:20:04,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05
25Q281,Parent_of_HS_Student,queens,Middle,297,"East-West School of International Studies is an excellent school to attend.  My son graduated from East-West Class of 2012 in June.  Before coming to EWSIS he had the hardest time adjusting with junior high school.  He was lost in a system with teachers who had no time or patience to deal with students' individual needs.  There were also a lot of violence and gang activity going on within the JHS.  It was like sending my son to war.  My son became very quiet and distant, his grades were horrible, and he never wanted to go to school.  I truly believe he would have dropped out of high school if he did not go to East-West.  Once my son began going to EWSIS he became a completely different person.  It was like a metamorphosis.  He was provided with a safe environment to grow academically, with social and emotional support that he truly needed to become the young man that he is today.  The teachers are amazing!  The Principal is the best!  The entire staff treated my son as if he was their own.  My son is a confident young man with high self esteem, he is now attending college.  The graduation rate for this school is 99% that in itself is a miracle.

My daughter entered East-West in the 8thgrade after
she had experienced some difficulties with academics in her zoned middle
school. She had struggled with math and English through 6thand 7thgrade
and fell behind with her grades. Unfortunately her school, which was enormously
overcrowded, did not provide her additional support and she continued to
flounder. She was fortunate enough to have been given a chance in the 8thgrade
at East-West. I say fortunate because every student at East-West is treated
individually and given the full academic, social, and emotional support from
the kind and dedicated staff. With this support she has made a true turn around
and is now excited to attend high school at East-West. East-West holds high
expectations for every child in the school while providing every child with the
necessary support and guidance to help them graduate and get accepted to an
accredited university.

One who is not just on the honor roll every semester, but also one that is involved after school and gives back to the East-West community and helps to interact and unite everyone.  I was encouraged to be a leader that represents the rest of the student body fairly and participate in public speaking as often as possible.  I hope to go into journalism, so I was able to have some experinece with the new internship.  My teachers always told me about scholarships such as the Project Bridge program I was psrt of from The Korea Society - a scholarship for a study tour to Korea.

One of the greatest things I've learned from East-West is the acceptance of other cultures.  I've gained this new desire to learn of other cultures and somehow make them my own.  I really love interacting with a diverse group of people and this school has given me that platform.  I have been given so many great opportunities and scholarships thanks to those in this school.  I have grown a lot since my first year-from being a 70s to 80s student in 7th grade, in my senior year, I became Class of 2012 Salutatorian.  From not being involved in any clubs, I became a student that spent most of her after school time dedicated to clubs.  From being someone whose heart pounded and palms sweated when presenting something to class, I became a student who can confidently speak in front of hundreds of people.  From being ""any other student"" I became someone who students and teachers positively recognize.  After experiencing everything I have and meeting some of the greatest teachers and friends in my life - I am proud to say that I was a part of the East-West family for 6 years now.

25Q281,Parent,queens,Middle,297,"

Dearest Mr.
Sherman,
 
I truly enjoyed our conversation yesterday afternoon. Your life’s experiences
have helped shape you into the caring man you are today. I am writing the
letter; you can use it verbatim. Please do not use my daughter’s name as I do
not want to embarrass her. Thank-you so much for all that you do, and all whom
you care about, it shows loud and clear!! We are blessed to have you.




I cannot say
enough about the East-West School of International Studies. I highly recommend
it for so many reasons, and quite frankly I feel that this is the absolute best
place for my child to receive her high school education, ensuring that her college
preparatory needs are being met. 


I have this
lovely 15-year-old daughter. She is quiet and reserved, although brilliant in
her own way and witty as can be. At home she shines as our star. Her school
experience had not been anything like this until she arrived at your school. As
a little girl she struggled with her schoolwork, and had a hard time forming
friendships. She repeated a grade at an age that affected her self-esteem.
School was never an enjoyable part of life, but a responsibility that had to be
endured. We did all that we could to help. She became a quiet, lovely
young lady, who just passed most subjects, and did well in the few that sparked
her attention. 


Applying to
high school made me very fearful for our daughter. High school is the most
important time in a child’s education. In elementary, if you just pass it’s not
so bad, because hopefully as you mature you catch on quicker and understand
easier. Middle school is important as you are now learning things like how to
study and work more on a higher level; and again, if you just pass, maybe you
are just a late bloomer and high school will be where you ""get it"".
That in life when you give it you all, 100%, it’s so much more rewarding to
you, and how you feel about yourself. 


We took all
the tests and my daughter was accepted into several schools, including catholic
schools. We wanted a small school, but none existed that we knew of. A client
of mine told me about East-West. It sounded great, but could it really be so?? Well
let me tell you....it is so, and so much better than any other school in New
York City. Even better than the 2000 schools! 


My beautiful
daughter, the quiet one....has made the Honor Roll three marking periods. She
strives to do better and enjoys it. She has made the nicest bunch of friends
from so many different cultures where no one shuts her out because we are not
the same!! Friendships were made quickly here and school makes her happy! She
never says, ""I don't want to go to school today"" anymore. This school
has the most caring staff I have ever met, a principal who loves what he does,
and students that are just as kind as my on child. 


I thank all of
the staff, from the bottom of my heart, for helping my daughter shine. You are
all wonderful at the many jobs that you do, and we are so much more fortunate
to have you guiding our
children!                               



Sincerely, 


Diane
Barbarito

It was my main reason for coming to this school. When I got used to the environment and the work, East-West can become a home away from home or an escape from all your troubles at home. The teachers are extremely nice.

My dream is to go to Japan one day and become a game designer. I view this school as part of the process of becoming a game designer. When I was in ninth grade, I wrote a story for a class project in ELA that I can use as a story line for a game, and the same year I learned that some games are based on history, like Assassin’s Creed. In short, this school has many opportunities for incoming students. Just being here, you never know what you’re going to learn next.

I have also always been fascinated about Asian culture and wanted to know more. I have been to both China and Korea through East-West and they have been the best educational trips I have ever been on. 

During my years at East-West, I produced a radio documentary for “Radio Rookies,” a show on National Public Radio, which showed my love for the Korean music industry. I wanted to share that it is okay for a non-Korean person to have dreams and goals in the Asian entertainment Industry. One of my English teachers encouraged me to apply. I stayed involved with NPR until I eventually became an intern as a college student. I am working on producing another show with them.

The administration provided a support group called the “First Year Teacher Circle”, in which we met to discuss various topics and concerns we had as new teachers. I was also a member of TEAM ELL, a professional learning group comprised of teachers from different fields. We met weekly with an ESL Coach to discuss how we can better support our English Language Learners and develop better practices. I received great mentoring support from the head of the science department inside and outside of the classroom and encouragement and advice from other helpful teachers which helped me accommodate to this school. Of course, without the support staff such as the guidance counselors, deans, secretaries, community assistants/associates and the school aides, many of the tasks I do outside of class would be difficult.  I was able to go above and beyond by offering physics tutoring on weekends and supervising a student fitness club.

25Q281,Rick Streicker,queens,Middle,297,"Last June, a chance introduction to Principal Ben Sherman gave me the opportunity to spend a day at the East‐West School of International Studies in Flushing, NY.

Julia Cheng, the school’s Community Associate, arranged for me to join a class of 11th‐graders for their courses in science, math, literature, art and history, as well as the Asian languages that are central to the school’s mission.

None of the 800 or so days of my own high school career were as absorbing or revelatory as a single day observing what goes on at East‐West, where the future is quite literally being invented in one of the most exciting and diverse neighborhoods in New York City. Although East‐West is a relatively new institution, the school has already developed a distinctive, cooperative culture in which the ubiquitous anti‐bullying posters of the public school system seem decidedly out of place. When Principal Sherman raised his arm to quiet the auditorium for morning assembly, the air was instantly filled with the upraised hands of teachers and students alike, and the normal morning hubbub quickly subsided in a triumph not so much of discipline as of dedication to a common purpose. This dedication, which was on constant display even on the Friday before the start of Regents Exams, did not snuff out the liveliness of class discussions or the very funny (and nondisruptive) side banter between class members.

I came away from my day at East‐West convinced that its graduates will form part of a new generation of bright, well-informed, internationally minded New Yorkers from whom the city, the nation and the world can expect great things.",9,0,0,2011-07-19T19:17:39,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05

25Q281,Christian Flores,queens,Middle,297,"East-West has a variety of services to offer to incoming as well as current students. To be more specific, East-West teachers are great resources for school work. Through the East-West e-mail system, most teachers are available to help students. Different extracurricular activities and student led clubs bring school spirit to East-West. Guidance counselors are readily accessible with outstanding work ethics and personalities. Teachers engage students through the use of smart boards, laptops and projectors. Our ever-changing global world is in need of Japanese, Korean and Chinese speakers; something that East-West prepares its students for. Everything that East-West offers to its students is whole-heartedly made to benefit and succeed in the real world.

I came to East-West, freshmen year, as a shy, not very out-spoken, antisocial individual. This all changed as I became more engaged with school activities and befriended many people. I graduated this year as the valedictorian. Through studying Asian language and culture, I became more aware of the world around me in terms of the global community. I’m proud to say that, when saying ‘hello’ in Japanese or Korean, one must bow. My experiences in East-West have taught how to be a leader in various clubs, mature as an individual, perform hours of community service as a humanitarian, become independent as a young adult and a better person in general. The East-West experience is unforgettable and will open many opportunities in the future with the all the skills and tools gained over four years. I left East-West as a completely different person, for the better. 

In East-West, I have also grown as language learner. Learning Chinese was hard, but a very rewarding experience. Recently, I was accepted into the Chinese Flagship Center Program at Hunter College, where I will be able to fluently speak Chinese after four years. The first three years of the program, I will have the luxury to learn Mandarin Chinese. Eventually, the last year of my career at Hunter College as a student, I will be sent to China to study at Nanjing University for a semester and then an internship in China, the second semester. This major in Chinese is a complement to my International Relations major, where I will be studying to pursue a career as an ambassador or diplomat to China in the future.

25Q281,EL,queens,Middle,297,"I am currently a graduate of this school, East West School
of International Studies. I remember when I went to a high school fair when I
was in 8th grade, looking for a good high school that wasn’t typical
or boring to me. When I first met Mr. Sherman and some of the other students
who are now alumni of our school, I instantly knew that this school would have
my attention.  liked that this school offered Asian languages, because not
many other schools do. I wanted to learn more about China.

I signed up for information about
East West because of the languages that were taught, the technology and the
school clubs they had offered. Due to some funding issues, we didn't have as
many clubs as we intended on participating in but the school did have some
technology that grew in number as the years went by. Attending East West, I
studied Chinese. We had the opportunity of choosing which language we wanted to
learn and Chinese was the language for me, as there is a demand for people who
are bilingual or even trilingual.

East West is an interesting school
with students who treat each other like family. As the years go by, people
became very close, often including newcomers into our humble family. Strong
friendships have been formed and I will definitely miss my family but attending

25Q281,Student,queens,Middle,297,"I have attended East-West since its' start. I've watched it grow from a school that included only two grades to what it has become today. I want to start off my talking about my first impression of the school. At first, I was against going to this school because it was new and I would have to meet a crowd of completely new people. From what I read about the school, it had many ambitions and promises to not only the students but as East-West as a whole. My first year was an interesting experience and it wasn't surprising that nearly everyone knew each other. However, the community didn't know much about the school, which was the main reason behind the lack of spirit of our students. The school itself lacked a lot, maybe because it was new. I remember one of the promises the school had made for us was giving every student their own personal PDA. We were promised this the second year and we still didn't receive them...Eventually the faculty stopped with this ongoing promise. Many students were also against the school uniform and found different ways to disobey the rules, knowing that they wouldn't receive a harsh punishment. The first year, honestly, wasn't the greatest for me because the students in the school had a very negative impact on me and I didn't feel the support from the staff either. But, we didn't have a few memorable school events that brought us together. By the end of the first school year, a number of students and teachers had left the school to move onto another one. The second year was interesting because it was the first step towards our growth; we had more students and more room. This was the year when there were several issues in our school...We didn't really have clubs and the students didn't get along right away. I remember the first and second year, no one really had a desire to be involved and make a change, including me. The year went by like any other and many of my friends moved onto what they labeled as ""better"" high schools. I really wondered if this school would lead me to less opportunities in the future. Through the following two years, our school began showing a spark of potential. One example of this was east-west holding the very first talent show. We began having more clubs such as Student Government. This really allowed the students to have a voice and to be able to communicate with the administration. We had our first graduating class and many of them ended up in great colleges/universities. Our school became more known in the community. It was a positive change for east-west. This has shown us the success of our school and students. Our students have achieved scholarships, high grades, and have been able to represent the rest of the school. We've have many events that have been enjoyable and a break from studies. This past year shows us that maybe this school will get somewhere.

I had the option to leave east-west a few years back but being able to find close relations with the people here, it was difficult for me to make that decision. One positive aspect of the school is the focus of east-asian studies. I enjoy being given the opportunity to learn about others and their cultures myself. It gave me a desire to want to learn and be self-determined. We are given opportunities such as visiting Japan, Korea, or China and even studying there. This is what makes our school stand our from the others. Honestly, before this school year, I wasn't involved in extracurricular activities within the school. But, once I joined, I enjoyed myself and I was able to learn with others, beyond the classroom. I also like how students acknowledge each other even if they've never talked to each other before. Many students are role models to our younger students and are able to help them when they don't feel comfortable with the staff.

What I believe the school still lacks is a challenge. Our students should be reaching high, not just being satisfied with passing grades. The students who work hard are able to obtain good grades with a breeze. But those who can't, struggle...I don't like that our school has students who aren't willing to work as hard as others. Students who hold us back from becoming the best are students who don't belong in this school. Another aspect which I would like to see in east-west is AP classes. Many other high schools have APs and it shows that students are just getting good grades in the required class but are reaching for a challenge. This may have a negative impact on the student's future for when they're applying to colleges. Our school also needs pride. There are too many students who hate going to this school and want to just make it through the year...There needs to be something to change their minds. If our students don't want to make a change, no one else will either. Two problems which I faced with this school was the importance of students vs. teachers and staff members. First off, there are staff members who are disrespectful and offensive to the students. This prevents the students from being comfortable to rely on the staff. I also had an issue when I had nearly $135 stolen from me in school...The staff members blamed me for this issue. They said I shouldn't have brought this large amount of money to school. I brought that money to school because it was my mom's birthday the next day and I had planned on buying her present after school. And our school should be a place where I can feel safe and not have to worry about safety of my belongings. Why do I have to be so cautious? I reported this incident to the teachers right after school and they told me to write a report on it. Days passed and nothing was done. I knew who the student was who stole my money but the staff claimed that I had no real evidence, even though I saw him with my money. Another case was when a teacher's wallet was stolen. When this was reported, the classroom was locked by the principal and the students were told that if we don't return this wallet, the police would be called and all of us would get in trouble. Eventually a student found the wallet and returned it...My objection is why isn't the school as concerned about the students as it is about the staff members. We are the ones who make this school a success therefore we should be given more rights. This means we need trust between our students and staff.

The experiences I've mentioned are those that I had a few years ago. It makes the school sounds really bad...But over the past year, I've realized that it isn't so bad. Sure, east-west isn't perfect but it is taking clear steps towards improving. The school just felt a better environment over the past year and the year before. It made me want to become involved and encourage other students as well. Several community members and organizations even know about school and appreciate its' efforts. It's getting better and I'm not ashamed of going to this school anymore, even though it took a long time for me to reach this point. I think we'll get there, one day we'll be able to reach to students as one of the ""better"" and brighter schools. I have had a few bad experiences in this school but I think I would have in any other school as well. I'm actually looking forward to the next school year and see what it brings for us.",3,0,0,2011-06-22T20:56:56,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05

East-West. It’s a unique school containing about 600 students who have an
opportunity to learn Japanese, Korean and Chinese. East-West school focuses its
studies on the Asian culture. I learned Japanese at East-West. It’s one of the

I was even given a scholarship to attend a free trip to Korea. I was exposed to
a completely new culture and observed how others on the other side of the globe
live their lives.  Our teachers also
traveled with us, one of them being Ms. Rhi, a Korean teacher, who helped us
travel around Korea and guide us around its amazing cities. 


 


The teachers here at East West also made it worthwhile. Most
of them offer tutoring and help on the subjects they teach. They really make
sure that almost all the students pass each marking period. I graduate tomorrow
and I can truly say that I am going to miss East-West. I have a lot of memories
here which I cherish, and a lot more to make as I leave with the things I
learned onto the road of success. Each step I take puts me closer to success and
East-West was one of those important steps. Every step takes me up closer to
success and there is no such thing as failure, just temporary failure disguised
as success, we just have to have our eyes and mind open when it appears. ",8,0,0,2011-06-22T19:27:06,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05

The teachers at EWSIS are very compassionate and caring, and they show respect for all students.  My son is just a ""kid"" with a ""simple"" mind (not diplomatic at all), who likes those he thinks are nice and dislikes those unpleasant.  My son always encourages his primary school classmates to switch to EWSIS for middle schooling, if they are not happy with their current middle schools.  The school spends a lot of time and resources on helping the ""at-risk"" students, hoping that these students can catch up with the syllabus and coursework.  My personal opinion is that EWSIS is the best middle school in the district, and I highly recommend P.5 students to consider EWSIS for their middle school and high school education - they definitely won't regret!",11,0,0,2011-03-05T23:07:34,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05
25Q281,Anonymous,queens,Middle,297,"Just wonder whether or not John is an ""at-risk"" student?  If so, you have made a right choice because EWSIS is definitely the best school for your son.  Since the school is a ""special"" school, which accepts an abnormally high percentage of ""at-risk"" students in the district, the school has designed a lot of enrichment programs for these students.  The teachers sometimes even ask the ""normal"" students to do their own work during classes, because they need to spend time with the ""at-risk"" students to help them catch up with the subjects taught.  I can't say it's wrong, but I think it just benefits the ""at-risk"" students at the expense of the ""normal and smart"" students.  I am not saying the school is not a good school, but I think the school can do a better job if it can assign students of the same or similar level to the same class.  If there are three classes for each grade, then divide the students according to their performance.  The top 25 students go to one class, then the next 25, and so on.  I think it's more fair to every student, and this plan can retain smart students to stay with the school when they reach high school level.  Of course, this plan benefits the ""at-risk"" students, too.  To be honest, it's time for my kid to think of high school education, and I am struggling with it.  However, if the school designs different programs for different levels of students, I will definitely want my kid to stay with EWSIS.  Again, if a school cares ""too much"" about the at-risk students, how can it keep the brilliant students?  At least, it should try to design a program that is fair to all students (even if not 100% fair, try to be as close as possibloe).",4,0,1,2011-03-11T00:12:10,0.75,0.094,0.128,0.0,0.9059999999999999,0.03,0.65,0.8109999999999999,0.017,0.135,0.027000000000000003,0.05

I hope to not be attending this school for my four years of high school. I liked it at first, made friends immediately, liked my teachers for the most part. I very much liked the trial period you get to choose your language. There are three languages: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. You get to try out each class to see what learning each language is like before you choose one. One thing I don't like about East-West is that there are no Black teachers and two Hispanic teachers. This website obviously hasn't updated it's EWSIS information because there are many more Black and Hispanic students. There are mostly White and Asian teachers. The school needs it's own building now that there are over 500 students. We have to attend one of classes in the auditorium with two other classes or in the library that doesn't really have enough space for us with those same to classes. Some teachers have a horrible accents so it is hard to understand them and nothing was done about it after my classmates and I complained about it. The teachers with the bad accents are mostly the language teachers so it's extremely difficult to understand instruction and the translation therefore hard to learn. Those also get visibly annoyed when asked to repeat what they have said so us students can understand it better. Since the school is small, there is constant feeling that everyone is in your business. Some of the teachers are actually good teachers and what they teach sticks while others not so much. Also, the uniform is very easy to go around. There are very many ways to bend the rules about uniform. Another thing is you're only supposed to use your locker for outside clothing (though it isn't, I have gym clothes, books, and shoes in my locker at all times), and only at certain times (no one follows this rule either).

25Q281,anonymous,queens,Middle,297,"Some points are fair statements, such as the use of lockers and the strong accent of the language teachers.  However, if students want to learn an Asian language during middle schooling, they have to adapt to the strong accent of the foreign language teachers.  In fact, how many people can master two languages at the same time without accent? There may be some, but definitely not a lot.  I won't say the school is perfect, because it does place a lot of emphasis on the ""at-risk"" students.  However, which school is a perfect school?  None.  Even Hunter College High School (HCHS) is not suitable for some students.  At least my son doesn't want to go to HCHS for his junior high and high school education (not because he's not brilliant enough to get into the school, but he just doesn't like it.)

My mother and I had a discussion before me entering the 6th grade about how I should go to a relatively smaller school because I would not be able to keep up in a big school community.  I was nervous at first because it is a huge transition from elementary to middle school. The current middle school assistant principal, Mrs. Poulos took me under her wing and made me feel very comfortable and safe in school.  In the seventh grade I had two teachers in almost every class. I can say that that was the most helpful thing towards my academic life. I had 85s and above in all my classes. As I went on to 8th, 9th and 10th grade I did not have an extra teacher in the classroom. I struggled, but it was not the teachers fault. The teachers did in fact the exact opposite and did everything in their power to help me succeed. During my junior year I had two teachers in almost every class again, which was extremely helpful because junior year is a tough year. For the first time I’ve had an average of 91 which is a huge deal for me. Our principal Dr. Werner has been at the school for only three years and has already made significant changes to better the school. Dr. Werner cares for every single student and helps out in any possible way she can.  She influenced me to join Student government my junior year and it was a way for me to express my ideas on how to improve our school as a whole or just a grade. Dr. Werner also asked me to join SLT (Student Leadership Team)  which allows teachers, administration, parents, and students to see our school as a whole and give our input and perspectives on ideas that could benefit the school and/or students. Not only Dr. Werner but also the teachers have made a positive impact on me. The teachers pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me do things I never knew I was capable of. They have the determination and ambition to see students succeed which is why I love the school so much. The teachers and staff are amazing. I know I can talk to any teacher because I feel very comfortable opening up to them and because we are a very small school, all the teachers and students know each other.  This allows students to create a connection with their teachers. It makes it feel more as a community rather than your average high school where there is a thousand kids in one grade and you don’t necessarily know everyone in your OWN grade. My friend Abigail and I put together an assembly in honor of teacher appreciation week with the help of our principal Dr. Werner. We came together and shared ideas on how we can get our message across to show that we truly appreciate the teachers. They are one of a kind teachers that you can never get anywhere else. We decided to make them personalized folders for each teacher filled with letters from their students.  I can say from the look on the teachers faces receiving the folders that this was a surprisingly amount of appreciation from the students. Teachers sometimes don’t even realize how much they can impact the student. We wanted to remind them that they are always appreciated.  The teachers is what makes WJPS definitely worth while.  As I enter my senior year I’m going to be very upset when I leave because the teachers have had such an incredible impact on my life and it is going to hurt not being able to see them on a routine basis.  The staff is always there to lend a helping hand or even just to be a listening ear. WJPS, not only to me but many many other students feels like our second home.  As the way it should be.

It took me a long time in 8th grade to decide where I wanted to go to high school and didn't know which school was the best fit. After months of discussing the decision with my middle school guidance counselor and parents, we decided on WJPS. Looking back , it was the best decision I've made. The small school environment and population gives students the opportunity to form close and supportive friend groups. In addition, the small school allows students to form relationships with the teachers and administration . Ask any student in the school , everyone has a teacher they can go to for advice , academic troubles , and just to talk. The teaching staff is amazing. They are supportive, always available and have a true urge to make sure every student has what they need to be successful . The administration has done a phenomenal job these past 3 years. Every administrator takes the time to know every student, to encourage student involvement , and always have an open door at all times. Anyone who tells you this school isn't academical challenging ... they are wrong. The school offers a variety of AP courses, and partners with Queens and Queensborough Community college to offer college now courses to every students. The school maintains high pass rights on regents and AP exams. Every teacher is more than qualified to teach these courses. Academics in WJPS are on par with other bigger high schools in Queens.  Students are offered a variety of extracurricular activities to take part in. This year the school has done a great job of making sure every club is running efficiently and has the resources they need to grow. If there is club you wanna start, the school willing will help students create their own clubs and will support the student until the end. If you are considering WJPS, you will not regret it. My high school experience so far has been the best and I am thankful for every staff member that has made it so great to go to school every day.

While I believe the basic tenets of learning, such as sharing and respect should be reinforced in the classroom, they should be taught first at home. My experience with WJPS  has never been less than impressive when it comes to a safe, inviting, caring and competent school environment.   My children attend WJPS, and have attended since 6th grade, my oldest is graduating 12th this year.   Yes, it is a small school, but the staff, teachers, the Sr Administration, are all deeply invested in educating well-rounded, world citizens who are prepared to enter any industry or academic discipline. From Student Government to Model UN to the twice yearly talent showcase, and everything in between, everyone has school pride!  I see the negative comments below and I must disagree.   My children’s needs were met, the work load, the AP classes offered, the tests, the social aspect, I have absolutely no complaints.  The teachers and admin staff has always addressed all my concerns, including when I feel my child needed more guidance, and help. They have also been very proactive in being strong with guiding all children who attend towards acceptance and empathy towards their fellow citizens. The Sr Admin is far from the incompetent accusation I saw posted below.  My child, who is graduating, was accepted to ALL colleges applied for with very decent academic scholarship offers.  My child's SAT score was in the 1300's without supers-coring it and I thank WJPS for setting the groundwork, and foundation, for what to expect in competitive colleges.  My youngest is doing very well also. This school encourages the students to think outside the box, ask questions and to see things differently sometimes, to help shape them.   I am a very happy and satisfied parent of a current student who is active in the school, and needs a little push here and there academically and my child gets it, the teachers, the staff, they are there and behind my child 100%.

25Q285,J.P.,queens,Middle,257,"My child attended WJPS straight out of elementary school until the eighth grade.  Biggest mistake of our lives and I want all parents to really consider your choices.  We liked the cozy student population and the journalism theme.  Unfortunately, we quickly realized that with the small number of students it meant that every class was slowed significantly so that the slowest learners can keep up.  So any above average student will excel in their grades but it's based on a very low curve.  Another issue came up when my child was ready to take a regents class and the school cancelled the regents class without announcement at the beginning of the school year.  The official explanation we received was that the previous classes did not perform well and the administration decided that instead of trying to pressure students to perform it would be better to do away with the regents class offering.  Sounds to me that they could not adequately teach the students and instead of reporting lower scores for students and teachers they decided that lowering expectations was the answer.  It sounds very convenient to the teachers involved but it's a tragedy for the students.  The overall vibe we perceived was that teachers were not up to par in teaching their respective classes.  And the administration was covering up for the teachers.  I can say this because I had to personally provide supplementary study sessions and we paid for after school classes.  So if you want your child to have fun in middle school and not be bothered by academic success then please choose this school.  But if you want academic challenges then choose another school.",0,1,0,2018-10-18T00:18:25,1.0,0.027000000000000003,0.179,0.0,0.6759999999999999,0.035,0.381,0.20199999999999999,0.023,0.405,0.342,0.157

If you're contemplating on sending your child to this school, and want them to get a good education, please do not send them. If it hadn't been for my motivation to be challenged, I would've never escaped that school. They pressure you to stay until the 12th grade, even though academically-gifted students might not want to stay in a school which don't even have staff who can challenge them and help them think for themselves. Instead, they have a ridiculous principal who acts all nice (I had an interesting experience with her when I was a 6th grader and she's just all-around rude. It was a horrible experience for an 11 year old). There's so much I could say about this school, but the main point is that this school isn't for kids who actually want a future.

Basically, there are two groups/two classes in each of these grades. So while students aren't ""screened"" academically upon entering the school, this method assures that only ""high potential testers"" are allowed to take the Common Core Algebra/Living Environment Regents. Sure, there are students slated for Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Townsend Harris etc. but what about the overall achievement of those who are not taking the Regents, and for whom no ""test prep"" is given.(I am not suggesting that testing /test prep correlates with achievement.)

26Q067,Paul Lee,queens,Middle,951,"As an alumni at MS67, I loved this school, because this school has given
 the challenges and opportunities to foreshadow what it's like to 
experience the high school years. Even though I wasn't in the magnet 
program, I was given classes that weren't difficult, but were a bit of a
 challenge. The teachers here, in general, are amazing! Depending on the
 teacher you get, you will either have a good year or have a frustrating
 year to work and study independently. MS 67 is a great school and 
offers ""electives"" that I think is one of the best factors about MS 67. 
The band is an amazing orchestra! The teacher, however, has retired. He 
was the best conductor and music teacher I ever had, so far! The new 
teacher, Mr. Peterson, is really nice and outstanding. The problem I had
 with MS 67 was the teachers were constantly changing every year! I 
mean, every year, from 7th grade to 8th grade, I saw new teachers that I
 never knew! Lol... that's not a big deal, but I think MS 67 should try 
and limit that habit. Other than that, MS 67 is a great school to be in.
 Guidance is amazing and the teachers here are wonderful! Come here and I
 will promise you 80-100% that your child or you (as a student) will 
attend/get accepted into NYC's best high schools. The education I 
received has helped me pass the SHSAT to get into Brooklyn Tech (not 
Bronx Science; I was just 2 points off!!!!) and Francis Lewis's 
University Scholars! Many other students show exemplary performance and 
high school acceptances. There may be some kids attending the zoned 
Cardozo, Bayside, Francis Lewis, or Martin Van Buren, but that doesn't 
make MS 67 bad. In general, MS 67 is an amazing school and personally 
recommend it to parents and students interested in coming here! Just a 
side note, if you become an 8th grader, MS 67 gives you the chance to 
skip the 8th grade Regents Core, which is Earth Science. The school provides an aptitude test, to show which Science Regents class you may have potential to take and do better in. I got the opportunity to take Living Environment and received good education on it. I took the regents and got a great score; a 96! It's not how the teachers teach that determines one's score; it's the student's effort to do well.

A lot of motivated and diligent students in the school, along with parents who seem to care about their children's academic and social development.  Parent-teacher conference is too chaotic and short- due to the number of parents the teachers have to meet.  The biggest adjustment I had to make as a parent - no more coddling by the teachers and staff (my child had attended a small elementary school where everyone knew each other), and the huge load of school work/assignments/tests.  The presence of other motivated and diligent students and the high expectation/standard set by the teaching staff - a plus.

I think you're getting confused here, but a lot of the kids here were zoned for Cardozo, yes, but you can't make the assumption that the kids who don't get into specialized schools go to Cardozo immediately. That's not the guidance counselor's choice; it's the student's choice of attending Cardozo. Plus, you have no right to say that. Unless you have valid evidence of what you're saying, please don't ever say that, because I'm sure you say things mindlessly. I'm sure you haven't been in this school before, I have been (Alumni Class of 2014). MS 67 is academically one of the best middle schools, so what you're saying is completely false. MS 158 is not a bad school either! I got a 511 on the SHSAT (getting into Brooklyn Tech) and Francis Lewis High School's University Scholars. I decided to attend Francis Lewis. Ok? There are many kids who do well and get into one of NYC's best high schools. My friend didn't get into a specialized high school, so does that necessarily mean that he's going to Cardozo? No! His zoned was Bayside and wound up getting into Cardozo's DaVinci. So, with my evidence, it's obvious that what you said was completely wrong. It's just that a lot of the kids do want to go to Cardozo, but they're not forced to. The counselors have no right to choose where every students go for high school. Do you think my counselor choose Francis Lewis for me? NO! I did, not him. Also, you may mean that the guidance counselor suggests Cardozo, not dump you.

26Q067,critic,queens,Middle,951,"MS67 shouldn't have combined regular classes and SP classes. The part about everyone taking Earth Science in 8th grade is a lie. You are made to take a ""placement exam"" in 7th grade, which by the way people think is rigged. Parents don't exactly care about the school, unless they're familiar with the staff and have had many children go through already. This article is a mixture of old information and new information. There was a computer class, but the only reason they stopped it was because the teacher retired. I'm not sure if it's still going though. I graduated last year, 2011, and now i heard from my little sister that the school's insane rules got even more restrictive. MS 67 is still a good school, but they're kind of blind. By kind of i mean very. Kids smoke on the corner, the teachers don't do anything, they could care less. One time during the summer, the man in the ice cream truck was selling cigarette packs to the 6th graders. SIXTH GRADERS.

Second, there aren't any 'insane' rules. It's a very free environment, and almost nobody I know got in serious trouble, and I know these people don't follow rules daily. I know I don't. Third, nobody smokes at MS67. Nobody. The teachers do something about it if they see someone juuling or smoking.

26Q115,ProudMamaof2,queens,Elementary,724,"At first, reading all the reports and comments, I was very VERY reluctant to put my kids into this school... I considered myself lucky when I got my son into PS 203 in PK and he's been there for the last 3 years - happy and in advanced classes. I tried to get my daughter in, but no luck. wait-listed for the 2nd year in a row.
However, circumstances change, and I was left with no choice and finally went to register my daughter for Kindergarten class for year 2016-2017.
I was greeted by a security guard as I would by any school guard, it's appropriate and acceptable. Proceeded to the office and was greeted with smiles and very nice and approachable staff who was very helpful, and again - nice. Didn't give me any issues, even though I was a week late with pre-registration, thinking I'd get a call from the other school. My daughter was approached by a Language specialist(I think), just so she can assess her skills, in a very nice sweet manner, asked her a few questions, which my daughter (who is normally extremely shy) answered all questions very comfortably. I met with the Parent Coordinator and spoke to him about my son who just scored high on G&T test and because they may have a spot for him, it would just work out for me to transfer him out of PS203 to this school, so my kids would go to the same school.

26Q158,Kelsey. Senior of 2011.,queens,Middle,1078,"I honestly hated this school.
The teachers were horrible, the students were abusive and the principal is extremely fake. I was in the 2009-2011 band and the principal didn't supply any funding for band. But, she'd waste money on unnecessary materials that other classrooms didn't need.
Most important thing was that we didn't have a senior trip for the seniors of 2011. Apparently, they gave us a poll if we'd like to go to 
1) Club getaway, which the seniors of 2010 went to and 90% of the people who attended were 7th graders.
2) A manhattan ""cruise"", which was really a 2 hour boat ride around the smelly Hudson river.
3) Something about Sports Inc. It was an arcade thing for 5+ year olds. Really? That's..so dumb.
NOW, this year, the 2012 seniors get to go to Six Flags.
What the heck is wrong with that?everything.
All we got was a senior barbeque that wasn't actually a barbeque.
It was really depressing.
Petitions were held to try to tell the principal that we'd like to go to Six Flags, where MS74 and MS67 went to D.C or other places overnight.

26Q162,Robertfromdanorth,queens,Elementary,643,"This review is VERY old. Margaret Allyn has not been PTA president there in about 10 years if not more.  There are a little more than 700 currently in the school.  Until June of 2011, there were few works of art to be seen in the school other than in the main hall and some classrooms.  The new principal (who was the AP) has an artsy flair and will hopefully bring more art into the classrooms as there is no art instruction at all in the school this year. In the past the PTA paid for the Studio art program but they are unable to do so this year. That alone is a poor reflection on both the principal and the PTA. Pay $13,000 for the whole school to have art for 6 weeks or pay $8,500 for the 5th grade to learn ballroom dancing?  They chose one grade to benefit because there is a competition involved. Better to disappoint the masses rather than give up a chance at winning a medal.  The PTA is slightly frigid and some members tend to look down on parents. They spend more $$ to fund raise than they make because they don't want to get their hands dirty. Meetings are a joke. Parents haven't had a say on school lunch or uniforms in years. Even the voting on the principal last may was limited to the PTA board members ONLY. Ms. Saunders herself claimed no one on the list could be reached. It's a school with a veil. Everything looks okay until you lift the veil, when you do, you probably won't like what you see.

26Q172,Justplainsimple,queens,Middle,979,"I am currently a student in this school. In this review, I will speak of the bad and the good. I was reading this, and this would have been fantastic if I was in school back when this was written. Back in 2008, when I was a 6th grader, there was no Exploratory Language Course. We aren't allowed to play during lunchtime in the adjacent playground. I know people who are smart and willing to learn; but are taught by teachers that do not know how to teach and help others, by instead blaming the student, and not attempting to help the person learn. Oh that reminds me, there is a BIG gap between students. Some, not all, some students in the Scholars Program put in good effort, time, and grades into their schoolwork. The conduct for the General-Ed on the other hand is not as good. They scream and yell a lot. BUT, it has gotten much better than before. No more people smoke, or do drugs or all that crazy stuff. We got nice, normal, but annoying kids with no effort to learn. Some people don't care at all; but some actually do.  There is a Student Government program, and I had a friend in the Student Government. My friend showed the council his ideas and had explanations on how they could achieve it; but he was given excuses in return, ""We don't have time....we cant do it now in the beginning of the year...etc.""  But, there are good things. They have a PTA association which is very active in the school.They have fundraisers and bake sales in order to get money to use for their school, as well as two school stores; one for money and one for kiosk machines. Some administrators (Ms. Kaplan, for example) work hard in order to keep the school in shape, visiting at lunch sometimes to calm the chaos that may erupt, and going to classrooms during the day. The teachers in the school are not all good, but many are pretty good at teaching. Some are strict but help you learn, while others are more calm and relaxed. The building itself is not in the best condition, but they try in maintaining its shape, with janitors cleaning outside, in the hallways, and everywhere you can think of. This may not be the 100% school. This may not be the place for those prep-students that want to go to Harvard, but it might be a good place for those students in the Scholars Program.

Principal Jeffrey Slivko responds: ""We are in the midst of a massive fundraiser dedicated to raising $100,000 towards replacing the obsolete computer equipment we recently discarded. We are also awaiting monies for computers and just (last week) received additional city monies which are being used to enhance our sagging technology infrastructure. This year, we have already placed eight Smartboards (which are shared) in classrooms and have trained teachers in their use. Many teachers do have websites, but all teachers do not. We continue to work with teachers to give them the technology skills to better assist students.

26Q178,Lanie,queens,K-8,514,"This is a great atmosphere for elementary and middle school students. Small classes allow teachers to individually help students. The projectors, Smartboards and computers in the rooms are state of the art. 

Because this school is so great, I am able to take 9th and 10th grade courses, while still in middle school. I am taking a biology regents in June. Biology is a 10th grade class. I am also taking Algebra which is 9th grade. Because of this, I can take accelorated classes in my high-school.

My teachers are insanely nice, and caring. They will go out of their way to help you. One teacher saw a girl crying in the hallway, and spent her entire lunch period calming the girl down and helping her, as well as calling the guidance counsler. The teacher didn't have lunch that day, because she cared so much about her student. That is dedication. My other teachers always make themselves available if you had trouble in class or with homework. You can visit a teacher before school, during lunch, free period, or after school. Teachers share much of their personal lives with students, making the bond greater. Sometimes I feel like I have personal tutors for each of my subjects, because my teachers are so close. They also have great senses of humor, and make class enjoyable.

The school recently built a new playground outdoors, which students in all grades enjoy. Tennis courts and a baseball daimond will be added to the school yard. At the moment we have basketball hoops and handball courts, as well as two large playgrounds and jungle gyms, so you are never bored during recess. Some students read in the shade during lunch, or create study groups and do homwork together. The small classes allow students to know everybody in their class. (There are only about 60 students per grade.) In addition, everyone is racially, culturally and religously diverse. Students are very open about these things, and proudly talk about their culture as others eagerly listen.

Sports teams usually practice once or twice a week, but you can be excluded for practice with a note from a parent. The teams have won numerous trophies which are displayed in the school. 

Academic teams also compete, and have brought home trophies, plaques and medals. The hallway outside of the main office is scattered with numerous awards that the school and students have won. Teachers encourage academic contests, and students have won cash prizes and other things because of their tremendous writing and drawing skills.

Students who wish to take extracurriculars will have no problem finding a program that suits them. Many students take part in multiple programs. Debate Team, Peer Mediation, Newspaper Club, Band, Recycling Club, Math Team, Vollunteering Club, NJHS, as well as mandatory art classes, computer classes and performing arts and theatre classes will keep anyone engaged. There are plenty of other extracurriculers, but frankly I can't think of them now.

Bullying is NOT an issue at this school. Weekly advisory meetings with the guidance counsler let students do fun activities in small groups that promote following virtues, building character, and stopping cyberbullying as well as regular taunting and teasing. The guidance counslers are extremely helpful. During the ever-stressful time of high-school applications, the guidance counsler made herself fully available to answer all questions, as well as reccomend schools that would interest students based on their academic and other interests.

The building itself was newly renovated, and is in great shape. It has 2 girls bathrooms and 2 boys bathrooms, which is more than enough room for the small student population. The cafeteria is spacious, and often times is only half-filled with students. It has a large, flat-screened TV hanging on the wall which is used for announcements as well as for advertising when students are running for student government.

The library is amazing. It is stocked with a variety of books to suit the needs of all ages. Simple books are kept for younger grades, but other more intellectual books are kept for the middle school. All classrooms have their own library, but the library I am talking about is used for all classes. Middle schoolers used library class as a study hall period. The library has 5 computers for students to use whenever they wish, which are always available. The library also has 2 printers, (one color, one black and white) and a scanner for documents and photos. The carpet in the corner has beanbags and cushions so that you can cuddle up while reading. Some of my favorite selections fromt the library are Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Romeo and Juliet, Nancy Drew, and a biography on Charles Shultz. The library also contains 2 or 3 full sets of encyclopedias, as well as dictionaries, thesauruses, and translators. All students can take out books whenever they wish, and then return them after about a week or so. Books can be renewed as many times as you want.

The technology lab has a full new set of 30 computers. They hold the newest versions of software such as Microsoft Word, Excell, Powerpoint and Onenote, as well as Macromedia Flash, Fireworks and Dreamweaver.  

The art room is filled with paints, brushes, pastels, shading pencils, newspaper, string, and all sorts of craft items. The walls are lined with student work, and is extremely colorful. The art room also has a set of Mac Laptops which can be used for digital artwork, or for downloading photos that were taken with a digital camera for projects.

Overall, P.S. /I.S. 178 The Holliswood School is the best elementary and middle school I have ever seen. It seems to tower over all of the other schools in the area. I will never regret going to this school, and I strongly suggest this school to anybody.

If you like to play sports or like to be in teams. This is a great school to be in. In the past years unto now I have been in soccer, volleyball, badminton, basketball and softball. And if you need extra help the teachers are there for you. Even if you need help on the state exam they have programs to help to you succeed. Teachers and staff actually care about how you do in school. They want you go on to high school and college. If you like to sing there is young people's chrous for 3-8 grade.

Our school houses grades Pre-K through 8 and has about 500 students, while a nearby middle school that many kids leave to go to, has over 1500! If you want a small atmosphere where teachers and staff know you personally, and you're not just a number, then you should definatly come here!",3,0,0,2011-11-07T21:42:19,0.75,0.07200000000000001,0.14800000000000002,0.013999999999999999,0.086,0.019,0.257,0.115,0.07400000000000001,0.086,0.7020000000000001,0.09

26Q178,treehugger64,queens,K-8,514,"P.S. /I.S. 178 is by far the best school I have ever seen. I've been going there for 9 years. You would think one would get bored with the same school, but not me. These 9 years were well spent, and honestly, I don't think I would have done as well going to another school. This school was a BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL! That's an honor respected all over the country may I note. Basically, the blue ribbon goes to schools that exhibet excellent work. I give credit to all of the teachers who try their hardest to help us succeed. Because of the low population, the class sizes are smaller than average, and teachers know your name and know you much more personally than in over-crowded schools. Even the principal and assistant principal know everyones names. And at the top of the page you see the racial statistics: I believe we're much more than a number. We have multiculture day, where everyone brings in a board and foods from their culture and shares it with the school. We have people from Korea, Russia, Germany, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Ireland, Colombia, Bangladesh, Italy, China, etc: so don't judge the racial factor from above. Smart boards are eqiupped in every middle school classroom. (This is a K-8 school.) The extra-curricular activities are also superb. We have competative and non-competative teams including sports teams such as: Basketball, Soccer, Rugby, Football, Badmitton, Handball etc:. For the acedemic student we have: Math Team, Debate Team, Think Quest (A club where people make websites), etc:. For the student who wants to help the world we have: Recycling Club, Penny Harvest (A club where people collect money to give to the poor.) And of course the others such as Drama/Theater, AV, etc: You can easily be involved in more than one club due to them being on different days. Finally, the biggest question. Homework load?- The answer is: In elementary school the homework is fair, for younger students you won't get much homework at all, then when you get to 5th grade the homework takes about an hour or two at the most. Once you're in the middle school, the work load gets harder and you have to pace yourself. An organized student can get done in an hour or two, but if you're like me, it takes me 3 or 4 hours because I tend to get distracted VERY easily.-But that's me. Overall, I'd say come to Holliswood, the best school around! -GO BULLDOGS!",3,0,0,2011-05-02T20:47:08,0.75,0.07200000000000001,0.14800000000000002,0.013999999999999999,0.086,0.019,0.257,0.115,0.07400000000000001,0.086,0.7020000000000001,0.09

26Q188,CreativeKid,queens,Elementary,684,"As a former student, I loved this school. I can say that there is social seperation from the Magnet and ""Normal"" classes, but people do mingle in the afterschool programs. For the kids who enter the Magnet program, in 3rd grade for example, from one of the ""Normal"" classes tend to combine their old friendships with the ones developed in the Magnet program. I am strongly against the idea to develop a citywide test for PS188. PS188 is not that type of environment, and some of the upsides of PS188 is that all the kids usually live near each other, they have known each other for a while, and they have even seen their teachers around town. And lets say a child from Brooklyn gets accepted into PS188--What if they have a half an hour commute? You would have to wake the child up earlier than normal, and it is more that likely that their parents work in the opposite direction of PS188. That would put unnecessary stress on the child and the parent.

Instead of spending money on creating a testing program and having children be sent out of their neighborhood to another to get a good education, maybe the city should spend money on making schools in less educated districts better.

This is a great school for smart kids and even a better
school for kids that need additional help. Teachers do not make excuses for
anyone. It's elementary school after all and ALL kids regardless of their
innate ability should be able to master the material.  So advice to parents, don’t blame the school
if they can’t keep up – work with the school to demand more from your
child.  The moment you lower the bar for
your kid, you have given up on him or her!

26Q203,lucky to be here,queens,Elementary,860,"I don't believe anything in your note. My child is a minority in P.S. 203 and has been for  two years now. When I brought my child to this school I had no knowledge of how wonderful an experience it would be. My child was a student in a private school that didn't have the funding to help, so they just kept passing him to the next grade. My child started this WONDERFUL SCHOOL in third grade with a first grade reading level and was given all the extra classes he needed to sucide within record time. We were told right away that my child might be left back at the end of the year. However, P.S. 203's Principle,teachers and staff worked harder then I could have ever hoped for and my child not only passed but earned 4's on both state test.
I am so thankful to the teachers for all their hard work and love,to the staff for all their compassion and to an amazing principle that isn't afraid to bring the best out in her teacher. Being ""THE BOSS"" is a hard job and I have never seen anyone in all my years do it as well as Mrs. Nussbaum. Her job is to make the children in her school sucide, to make sure the staff is doing their job and if that means she comes off ""mean"", you need to realize, that's her job and THANK GOD she does it well enough to be one of the top N.Y. public schools. You should feel blessed that your child has been given the chance to be apart of this school rather then complaining about unfounded feelings. 
I don't know where my child would be today if it wasn't for all of these wonderful professionals.

The cleaning staff maintains a clean environment for productivity. The teachers go above and beyond to providing successful students education. They offer their time to hold tutoring and keep in touch with parents to keep them updated on progress (good and bad). I would like to think that because they have a good principal,  Dr. Landeau, to lead by example.

Because of this I have probably met about half of the teachers at this school and each teacher has been encouraging and supportive. From the moment I went to orientation with my son for 6th grade I felt right at home and I felt that my kids were going to be okay. The principal, Dr. Landeau, is an amazing speaker and quickly captivated the crowd.  He spoke of his personal experience in middle school which really resonated with me. I can’t say enough good things about this school. The Parent Coordinator, Mr. Nicholls, is not only a parent coordinator but a friend, his door is always open. The teachers are phenomenal, talented and go above and beyond for their students. The students are just as amazing and I have met some of the very best parents at Ryan. This is a school of about 1500 kids and it runs like clockwork and offers so much to the kids academically and for after school activities.  I know when they walk into Ryan they are safe.

When she went to Ryan I asked myself will she be able to that does the school provide such activities will she be able to adjust in her new school. My daughter was participating in many clubs from dance to leadership program. She was highly active student more than elementary. The school built her personality, her skills, her goals, her dreams. The school tought her the skills , showed her the way of success and she achieved her goals she was one of the top students. And now my son will graduate from the same school. This school improved my son’s academic levels in overall the school helped him to be in honor roll after 6 months and he is still in honors roll. Such school I will never forget and I will always be thankful for everything they did it to my kids. Five years I never had a single complaint about the school in anything.

If I had the chance to place my own child in any of the schools I have ever taught or attended, it would be this school.  Everyone here is nice, from the principal to the guidance counselors to the lunch personnel to the janitors.  I really appreciate the fact that this school is so diversified and caring.

I have always had good communication with parents and really appreciate the new parent coordinator.  The parent coordinator is compassionate and caring, and I always know he and the guidance department truly care about our students.  I am proud to work here and the parents of this school are proud their children attend this school.  There's no wonder this school is working at capacity.

The leadership team is a group of professionals who are authoritative and respectful.  It all starts with leadership, and I believe we have leaders who are tough and fair.  I respect them immensely as they are empathetic and appreciative of my hard work.  I appreciate they have brought bragging rights back to Ryan.

My fellow teachers are very hard working and talented.  They are technologically gifted, implement a vigorous curriculum, and have many different levels of experience.

at Ryan. I remember a young lady, an eighth grader, speaking about her
experiences at Ryan and how much she loved the school. I looked at my son and I
had the same hopes and dreams for him. 

I have always had faith in my son’s teachers and therapists. The
administrators and staff at his schools have been wonderful, too, and never
more so than at Ryan. I was very anxious when he started sixth grade. That
transition is a tough one. I realized right away that the work was tough but
the teachers, administrators and staff always support these kids. They never
feel alone, they always have guidance and help. I saw my son turning into a
young man these last three years. He's taking ownership of his life and
choices. It has been incredible to watch. 

I really don't even think I can express how grateful I am to everyone at
Ryan. My son would not be in this place without this school community helping
him, guiding him and encouraging him. It is truly a special school. I feel

PS 221 is a beautiful school building. PS 221 is a clean school. The rooms, floors, walls and desks are always clean. Carpets in classrooms are vacuumed. Being in a clean school helps us learn better.

The cafeteria at PS 221 is where we eat. In the cafeteria, we can talk to each other. They serve good and healthy food. There are a couple of different food choices. Lunch is never boring. In the cafeteria, the lunch ladies are very nice. We all have a spot to sit in. There are lots of tables in the cafeteria.

PS 221 is a National Blue Ribbon school. We study hard for our tests and we never cheat. We work hard to take care of our community. We listen to each other and our teachers. We are respectful and peaceful. We work hard and don't give up.

27Q043,Alex,queens,K-8,808,"I hope that everyone who has posted has an opportunity to read this post. I entered the education system within the walls of PS/MS 43 in 1997. It was a ground of care and discovery. Teachers aided this environment, the parents and students created it.  I graduated in 2004. I am now a Midshipman at the United States Naval Academy. If that is not success, please tell me what it is. I was instructed by the same teachers your children have. I resolved issues with the same ""overwhelmed"" guidance counselors. I wrote essays in the single computer lab. I studied under Mrs.Classie when she was Ms. Stublick. I was under the command of Principal John Quattrocchi. 
The success of students is not solely  dependent upon the discipline of their instructors, but also the respect of the students. The respect is instilled at home. If parents forget to instill this paramount value within their children, then lack of response to authority should be expected. 
I studied in overcrowded rooms. I read the inappropriate comments on the bathroom stalls. Yet I had the determination to work hard and make it through. If I can do it, your child can do it.

They have terrible teachers that have no idea how to handle bullying and like so many misguided teachers that fall for the bullies' lies, they end up blaming the victim. Look up the number of kids in elementary school that have been traumatized by this sort of negligence. 

There are some things that are blamed on my son that cannot be him because of the environment he lives in. How would he know about the behaviors of parents when he only lives with his two older siblings for the last 5 years and he's only 9? 

This school needs to get its facts straight. I have seen him get bullied and when I confronted the teacher that wasn't paying any attention she blamed it on him because the bully lied and said my brother hit him.

However, what is most disturbing with this school's administration is the lack of direct and immediate action to appropriately handle incidents that are brought to their attention.  In fact, it is clear that the manner in which numerous parental concerns have been handled involving unsafe conditions, physical confrontation and injury is unacceptable.  Many schools take these matters VERY seriously and have little to no tolerance for acts of malice, horse playing and especially bullying.  Actually, there are times when the punitive consequences are delivered to heavily, as I have personally experienced with my own children and former students who I taught in private schools.  I do not favor one extreme over the other.  However, I do expect strict rules with contingency plans in place.  I expect swift response time/notifications and thorough investigations that will satisfactorily address the concerns of parents who entrust this institution with the care of their child.  I also expect proactive measures to ENFORCE a no tolerance policy for any unsafe condition.  These are basic, imperative necessities a school should and must provide.  Hopefully, the voices here are heard and action will be taken to address and reverse the negative reputation gained due to the inability to embody simple communication and protocol.

27Q124,Lorraine,queens,K-8,1134,"It has to be terrifying for a parent to have their children in a school where they have to be concerned about their safety.  We know that bad things happen and that there are bullies, but the least a parent should be able to expect from their child's school is that when such incidents happen, that they are dealt with appropriately so as to properly care for any children injured and prevent further incidents.  And, in such incidents, if a parent is upset and showing concern for their child, rightfully so!  This should not be ignored or pushed aside. 

It’s evident that the school is overcrowded and understaffed.  But when we are responsible for the children in our community, then we need to step up and ensure that their safety is primary.  There needs to be some type of resolution, and the school could stand to use some input from the community.

27Q124,Ryan Nasim,queens,K-8,1134,"The administration of P.S. 124Q is disgraceful, disrespectful, and concerning. As a community member with nieces and nephews who attend this institution, I am highly concerned for the type of care, education, and accommodations our children receive when they walk into P.S. 124 five days a week. Specifically, the Assistant Principal is rude, disrespectful and unprofessional with concerned parents. The Interim-Principal at the institution demonstrates a lack of empathy when dealing with conflicts that involve bullied children, as well as children who have suffered permanent physical injuries as a result of such bullying. However, as constituents of the community we need to raise a concern of the administration of P.S.124 to those who employ such unqualified individuals such as the Assistant Principal and Interim Principal at the institution. After a further investigation, I have learned that P.S.124 also have never executed a by-laws. Rather, P.S.124 employs a ""grab out of the hat"" voting policy that ensures anonymity and protects it from any claims of bias or interest. It is also highly concerning that the administration at P.S.124 become so involved and interested in the conflicts of students and parents that they take sides of other parents thereby demeaning the concern and requests of a complaining parent. This comment responds from the most common bullying incident where a 7 year old boy was bullied by another. The school not only refused to write an incident report but failed to find an appropriate disposition; refused to empathize with the complaining parent, refused to accommodate the child who is suffering physical injuries; intentionally placed the victim child back into a dangerous position where he is susceptible to injuries from his bully; negligently managed lunch aides during the lunch hour [which is when the incident occurred; the lunch aide did not even know a child was being bullied]; negligently managed the nurse aides who place victims of bullying back into public areas of the school; unprofessionally involved themselves in parental conflict by yelling at a concerned parent at a meeting that was intended to be restorative in nature, but not in practice; and the school administration, specifically the Assistant Principal was negligent when she failed to fill out the necessary paperwork correctly, which she had a duty to do so, and she failed to carry out such duty.

27Q124,Selina,queens,K-8,1134,"While I'm not clear on how the law works in NYC, here in NJ something called a Harassment and Bullying (HAB) Report is filed for every claim made by a child or parent, followed by a thorough investigation with both parties. My understanding is that not only was the decision to label this ""incident"", as an ""accident"", almost instantaneous, but the handling of the matter thereafter was treated with seemingly zero compassion for both the victim and his mother. Literal insult to literal injury. I also understand the story on record indicates there was a game in place, involving hand movements. How a hand game led to a smashed face in a table resulting in permanent dental damage, becomes lessened to a mere (hands in the air) mishap, is beyond me.  How a Principal's office and Superintendent's office alike, can rehash the words ""accident, accident, accident"" to a mother who has to (a) come up with the funds to repair what she can of her son's teeth, (b) come up with the words to repair what she can of her son's spirit and (c) come up with patience to keep her composure while be shooed away and snickered at, is also - beyond me.

27Q124,Mala Sookdeo,queens,K-8,1134,"On Tuesday, June 16, 2015 during the last School Leadership Team meeting of the 2014-2015 school year, I asked the parent coordinator about the process of having a CBO (community based organization) join the SLT team at P.S. 124. She informed me that for as long as she has been at the school, no CBO’s are allowed on the team. 

	As per the Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 (Article II - Team Composition, Attachment No. 4, Section 4, pgs. 1-2), it states: “Community based organizations may also serve on SLTs. The SLT will create a process for the organizations to apply for membership. A member of the team may also recommend an organization for membership. This will be done on an annual basis. Community based organization members will be included in the total number of team members, but will not be counted when determining the balance of parent and staff members.” I asked her to please advise as to the process the SLT of P.S. 124 should have in place for CBO’s. 

	In addition, when I asked the SLT team what the process was for choosing parents to serve on the SLT this past school year, the response was that names were chosen out of a brown paper bag for those positions. When I asked if that was the customary process for choosing parents, the response was “yes.” When I asked how long the term was for parents, the current PTA president looked at the rest of the team and asked, “What are our Bylaws?” as the entire team looked perplexed. The interim principal finally interjected and said it was 1 year. When I asked what the Bylaws of P.S. 124 are in accordance with this matter, there was no response. I am unclear as to why the Bylaws of the School Leadership Team of P.S. 124 are not completed in written form.

	As per the Chancellor Regulation A-655 (Article II- Team Composition, Attachment No. 4, Section 4, pg. 1), it states: “Election of Team Members Parent and staff SLT members must be elected by their own constituent group in a fair and unbiased manner determined by each constituent group. All elections must be advertised widely, with reasonable advance notice given. Elections must be open to all members of the constituent group and must be held in accordance with the term limits set forth in these bylaws. Parent member elections must be scheduled after PA/PTA elections are held each Spring. Parents must be provided a minimum of ten calendar days notice prior to the election. The PA/PTA is encouraged to stagger the terms of the non-mandatory parent members of the SLT.”

27Q124,Mala Sookdeo,queens,K-8,1134,"On 5/29/15 my 1st grade son was a victim of bullying when his head was smashed into a lunch table by one of his classmates. The child broke my son’s front, permanent teeth. The school aides should have been watching my son’s class and was not. I have been going through the proper protocol of speaking with the AP (who deals with the younger grades), the guidance counselor, and the principal to address my concerns. I requested a meeting with the child’s parents to which the principal declined to be present. The AP yelled at me during the meeting, creating a very hostile environment. The child that did this to my son was not suspended as per the Chancellor’s Regulations that addresses infractions linked to disciplinary actions. 

There was another bullying incident with my daughter 3 weeks prior when two classmates kicked and punched her in the schoolyard during recess. The school aide took a written statement from my daughter and made a copy for her to give to me. She was supposed to give her copy to the guidance counselor. She put the statement in her bag and went home. I was not notified by the school.  When I went to the school the next day to address the bullying issue, the AP was completely unaware that anything happened. She took statements from my daughter and the bullies as well as other children involved. On 6/3/15, I asked for the copy of the online report she should have filed. She told me she never filed a report because my daughter had no injuries. I responded saying that it is a bullying incident report that should have been filed. She claimed she gave the bullies 3 days of lunch detention. When I reminded her that she previously called me and told me she gave the bullies 5 days lunch detention, she then yelled at me in front of everyone in the main office and said, “‘I’m done with you! Have a nice day!”

During that same week my son was injured, another child broke his arm during recess. 

On 6/11/15 there was another incident with a 5th grader on the school bus who pulled a knife on his classmates. He threatened to kill them if they told on him. From what I understand, the child was on medication. This child should have been supervised at all times. The mother said the school did not call her about the situation. She found out from her son when he got dismissed from school. 

A parent came up to me who said a child was being bullied and had water bottles thrown at him. The administration told the mother it was her son’s fault because he made a racial comment. 

The school is excessively overcrowded and there is not enough lunch aides to handle over 1,300 children.  I am disturbed by the pattern of particularly violent children who are not being reprimanded for their physical attacks. Instead, the victims are made to feel as it is their fault that they have been targeted and attacked. 

I went to the DFA and superintendent for my district. They both said the child involved in my son’s assault will not be suspended because they did a full investigation and concluded it was an accident. They have yet to take a statement from my son. Therefore, a complete investigation was not performed. The lack of adhering to the chancellor’s protocol and the unprofessionalism the administration shows to the parents is an outrage. 

Today I went to Councilman Eric Ulrich's office to explain my son's situation and request for them to help facilitate a fair resolution. The Community Relations Advocate told me I had to go through the Department of Education and that she could only give me the chancellor's phone number and address. 

I am going to contact the Chancellor's office but it seems that going through the proper protocol gets me less results and more red tape. It's very frustrating and in the meantime my son is still in a school where bullies are not disciplined according to the Chancellor's Regulations for serious physical injuries.

27Q124,burderop,queens,K-8,1134,"History and Reflection

How Crowded?
The web site “insideschools.org” reports the “building was meant to house 650 kids”.  “Meant” is the operative word here for 650 had to be the intent when the building was constructed at the end of the third decade of the last century.  Suggested by the statement is a situation likely to mortify most of us with the thought of oppressive overcrowding rather than inspire us by a community of parents and educators determination to teach and to learn under challenged conditions.

My nine years at ‘124’ covered the late‘40’s through the mid ‘50’s.  Simple extrapolation of the headcount of my graduating class picture suggests a K-8 student population of about 700 pupils.  A similar headcount of the ’61 graduating class points to a 33% student enrollment growth in just five years.  The decade of the 1950’s was a period of explosive population growth in the city’s outer boroughs and surrounding suburbs.  I have no substantiating data but the social upheaval of the time and my own memories lead me to conclude my class was likely also on the order of 33% larger the class five years before its time.  The old building would have indeed been under utilized, back then.

The Harry Potter Prelude
The west wing addition to PS 124 was incomprehensible back then.  Numerous empty classrooms at the far ends of unlighted hallways sat in shadowy silence.  Nooks and crannies in that building beckoned unto me, but those fascinating places of intrigue were locked and off limits to the dangerously curious like me.  Fortunately, the terrific architectural features were out in the open and therefore mine to enjoy to the fullest.  Stepping out on that second floor front balcony to retrieve a flowerpot under wary eyes of teachers and the wide eyes of fellow students was a thrilling experience.  I was a really little guy back then so my recall of the physical world is that of space so much bigger then it was in actual fact.  The dual front entrance atriums contained open stairways, both broad and grand and I loved the tall and sometimes arched windows of the great rooms of the auditorium, the gyms and the first floor lunch areas.

Scandal!
Too young to comprehend the issues of the time, I recall an attempt in the early 50’s to close the school.  An obligatory community meeting was called wherein city/education officials expected to deliver the harsh facts-of-life in cold perfunctory style to a gullible and complicit collection of simple homeowners.  Among the citizenry someone or some group had done homework and came prepared.  During the public meeting errors in the ‘facts’ were exposed.  I am not sure of the details, but it may have involved faulty, doctored or missing maps.  The meeting imploded, the humiliated officials routed, and plans to close the school were never raised again.  Wish my parents were still alive to have them explain that story to me one more time.  Additional information regarding moment of victory for the people would be welcomed.

Race and Relations
The student body was all white with Italian-Americans the apparent ethnic majority.  African-Americans lived in a far away place known as Jamaica, just accrosse the newly built Van Wyck Expressway.  Late in 8th grade the first black students were admitted, one boy and one girl. Viewed with distant curiosity they did not absorb into the existing social order of our class but I recall no expressed bigotry or vitriolic racism.  Understandably, they were shy and perhaps apprehensive but any student would have felt awkward and out of place entering a class late in the school year where the already forged friendships reached back to kindergarten.

Students were not the first African American in our school.  Somewhere in the middle grades word came through the grapevine that Miss. Zuill was “Coming back”.  An aunt (born circa 1918) informed us that Miss Zuill had once been her teacher. That would link this educator to the school’s very beginning.  I was terrified of the woman, not because she was black but because of the stories of her strict manners.  Indeed, she had a hard veneer, but she was fair, she was professional and she was always confident.  As we came to know her we learned that while we had better not challenge her we could also find solace in at least knowing that she did not take herself too seriously.  In the midst of an oft-heard recital (The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere) or during stern rhetoric she would sometimes burst into brief but brilliant smiles that boarded on giggles.

All has changed.  That lonely schoolhouse on the old Bergen road and isolated by the Belt parkway built in the late 1930’s is relevant and vibrant, bursting at it’s seams…or so it seems. Today, it has a student body twice the number I knew.  The all white student population has dwindled to a mere 3%.  So what!  How delightful to read the performance reports found on the various web sites that report this information. If there were formal reviews in my day to determine student learning I never knew PS124’s standings.  All I knew was what I accomplished there was enough (barely) to get me into high school. 

Legacies and Evolution
Urban and close-in suburban upbringing in a pluralistic society is an enriching and enlightening experience.  It can also be difficult for the nostalgic inclined.  To flourish in whatever the future holds for us both individually and as a community we must welcome the inevitable if we have any hope to help form it.

History and
Reflection


 


How Crowded?


The web site “insideschools.org” reports the “building was
meant to house 650 kids”.  “Meant”
is the operative word here for 650 had to be the intent when the building was
constructed at the end of the third decade of the last century.  Suggested by the statement is a
situation likely to mortify most of us with the thought of oppressive
overcrowding rather than inspire us by a community of parents and educators
determination to teach and to learn under challenged conditions.


 


My nine years at ‘124’ covered the late‘40’s through the mid
‘50’s.  Simple extrapolation of the
headcount of my graduating class picture suggests a K-8 student population of
about 700 pupils.  A similar
headcount of the ’61 graduating class points to a 33% student enrollment growth
in just five years.  The decade of
the 1950’s was a period of explosive population growth in the city’s outer
boroughs and surrounding suburbs. 
I have no substantiating data but the social upheaval of the time and my
own memories lead me to conclude my class was likely also on the order of 33%
larger the class five years before its time.  The old building would have indeed been under utilized, back
then.


 


The Harry Potter
Prelude

The west wing addition to PS 124 was incomprehensible back then.  Numerous empty classrooms at the far
ends of unlighted hallways sat in shadowy silence.  Nooks and crannies in that building beckoned unto me, but
those fascinating places of intrigue were locked and off limits to the
dangerously curious like me.  Fortunately,
the terrific architectural features were out in the open and therefore mine to
enjoy to the fullest.  Stepping out
on that second floor front balcony to retrieve a flowerpot under wary eyes of
teachers and the wide eyes of fellow students was a thrilling experience.  I was a really little guy back then so
my recall of the physical world is that of space so much bigger then it was in
actual fact.  The dual front
entrance atriums contained open stairways, both broad and grand and I loved the
tall and sometimes arched windows of the great rooms of the auditorium, the
gyms and the first floor lunch areas.


 


Scandal!
Too young to comprehend the issues of the time, I recall an attempt in the
early 50’s to close the school.  An
obligatory community meeting was called wherein city/education officials expected
to deliver the harsh facts-of-life in cold perfunctory style to a gullible and
complicit collection of simple homeowners.  Among the citizenry someone or some group had done homework
and came prepared.  During the public
meeting errors in the ‘facts’ were exposed.  I am not sure of the details, but it may have involved
faulty, doctored or missing maps.  The meeting imploded, the humiliated officials routed, and plans
to close the school were never raised again.  Wish my parents were still alive to have them explain that
story to me one more time.  Additional
information regarding moment of victory for the people would be welcomed.


 


Race and Relations

The student body was all white with Italian-Americans the apparent ethnic
majority.  African-Americans lived
in a far away place known as Jamaica, just accrosse the newly built Van Wyck
Expressway.  Late in 8th
grade the first black students were admitted, one boy and one girl. Viewed with
distant curiosity they did not absorb into the existing social order of our
class but I recall no expressed bigotry or vitriolic racism.  Understandably, they were shy and
perhaps apprehensive but any student would have felt awkward and out of place
entering a class late in the school year where the already forged friendships
reached back to kindergarten.


 


Students were not the first African American in our
school.  Somewhere in the middle
grades word came through the grapevine that Miss. Zuill was “Coming back”.  An aunt (born circa 1918) informed us
that Miss Zuill had once been her teacher. That would link this educator to the
school’s very beginning.  I was
terrified of the woman, not because she was black but because of the stories of
her strict manners.  Indeed, she
had a hard veneer, but she was fair, she was professional and she was always
confident.  As we came to know her
we learned that while we had better not challenge her we could also find solace
in at least knowing that she did not take herself too seriously.  In the midst of an oft-heard recital (The
Midnight Ride of Paul Revere) or during stern rhetoric she would sometimes
burst into brief but brilliant smiles that boarded on giggles.


 


All has changed. 
That lonely schoolhouse on the old Bergen road and isolated by the Belt
parkway built in the late 1930’s is relevant and vibrant, bursting at it’s seams…or
so it seems. Today, it has a student body twice the number I knew.  The all white student population has
dwindled to a mere 3%.  So
what!  How delightful to read the
performance reports found on the various web sites that report this information.
If there were formal reviews in my day to determine student learning I never
knew PS124’s standings.  All I knew
was what I accomplished there was enough (barely) to get me into high school. 


 


Legacies and
Evolution


Urban and close-in suburban upbringing in a pluralistic
society is an enriching and enlightening experience.  It can also be difficult for the nostalgic inclined.  To flourish in whatever the future holds
for us both individually and as a community we must welcome the inevitable if
we have any hope to help form it.

Everyone is kind to each other. Mr. Lopez is the best. We won gold in NYSSMA. THe only problem I would believe this school has is the security guards. They don't know how to speak with the students. Also, they are just plain stupid. Some of yell at you for no reason. If you have to give something to a teacher and you walk back into school like 30 seconds after you have been dismissed, they yell at you for trying to sneak in, although I clearly told them I had to give something. The APs are extremely nice. We have many fun events now like Field Day and The Melting Pot. This year, I graduated and it was amazing. They have not been many fights also. I totally forgot, this lunch aid Edith is just plain stupid. SHe blows the whistle in your ears and tells you to sit even though you already are. Also, when we get our lunch She tells us to clean the table. The only problem with this school is some of the security guards and some lunch aids. The rest of the school is amazing.

-Ive been bullied here.
-Teachers are really lazy. They do not teach. They sit in a classroom all day long not teaching. All they do instead is tell students to open a book and answer the questions and yell at them!
-Students on the other hand are really rude. They are very distracting, annoying, undisciplined, uneducated. They would not listen to staff members.
-However, I commend two teachers in the 8th grade. Mrs. Gloria Brown and Ms. Nia Brown. They are the teachers that know how to educate students! (I want to thank you both by the way if youre reading this)
-So whoever is trying to look for a school in the Rockaways, I do not recommend this school for anyone. Your child will not get a proper education here.

I rest my case.

27Q210,someonewhoisattendingms210,queens,Middle,1884,"Hello, i am a fellow student attending MS 210. I am in the 8th grade and am in an accelerated/AP class. I will be taking four regents this year and let me tell you, this is school is much better than the reviews written below. The principal described in the article was fired and replaced by a man named Mr. Singh. Ms. Butcher, the old principal, was not the greatest in keeping the school in top shape. She did not have the best methods and harassed a couple of the staff members (this was the reason she was fired). However, she has left and Mr. Singh is doing a much better job.
   Our school is divided into academies and have certain programs that students in their individual sections can do. For example, the Visual Arts academy has classes such as theatre and can perform during our spring and winter festivals. In addition to that, rumors about teachers being ""terrible"" are not true. The staff at our school are nice people and can teach well. Many say that the teachers are bad due to their behavior and attitudes towards the teachers
   There are fights that occur in our school but that should not affect you in any way unless you're involved. Many also say they do not feel safe but absolutely nothing has happened that can ruin your life. The students are not threatening or very dangerous but they do have bad behavior; it's just a case of a ""bad attitude."" 
   Lunch isn't the greatest but that is not the school's fault, every other middle school in New York City is serving the same food. The cafeteria can be dirty due to the students who aren't capable of throwing out their garbage but, there aren't things such as food stuck to the walls.
   Personally, I love this school for the way it is but I wouldn't say it was your best option for middle school. If you're here to get a good, regular education, Ms 210 is the place for you. However, if you'd like an amazing education, you can earn it by getting grades to get you into an accelerated class (90 and above but, try striving for grades in the principal's honor roll range which is 94 and above. It'll guarantee you the chance of getting into an AP class). The curriculum is better and you get preparation for the regents (high school credits!). Being in an AP class gives you a larger work load but, if you aren't good with large loads of homework, a regular class would be best for you (I typically get 2-4 medium sized assignments everyday but that also depends on your teachers). 
   I hope this review helped and can help you choose your child's new middle school. If you are a student who is already ATTENDING the school, look on the bright side if your days here are going rough. You can ask for a transfer for a new class or maintain grades that will get you into an accelerated class (less troublesome students) for the next year. If you do have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them ASAP :)",0,0,0,2019-12-11T02:26:07,0.25,0.16,0.165,0.055999999999999994,0.768,0.066,0.6779999999999999,0.295,0.046,0.5920000000000001,0.04,0.242
27Q210,XxBAGELxX,queens,Middle,1884,"okay so most of these comments are old and you're probably looking for a more recent one. Well, here it is. Elizabeth Blackwell HAS CHANGED. They fired the bad principal and replaced her with a new and better one: Mr.Singh. He likes to enforce better rules, make us work harder, and make sure we have a good learning environment. Before he came these things didn't really happen often but now it does. He even created clubs for us which we did not have until now. Sure there are some problems such as how crowded it can be when you're going to lunch, and fights but doesn't that happen in other schools too? There are always going to be ups and down to schools to you can't really be sure if it's good or bad until you try it yourself. I personally think all the teachers are great and the staff. You shouldn't worry about your safety because there are security guards on every floor.
SOME PROS:
ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES FOR 6TH,7TH, AND 8TH GRADE
ADVANCED CLASSES EITHER TAKE 2 OR 4 REGENTS BASED ON THEIR CLASS
AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS

SOME CONS: 
VERY FEW FIGHTS
CROWDED WHEN GOING INTO THE CAF FOR LUNCH
SCHOOL LUNCH IS OKAY (but I mean..isn't all school lunch just okay?)

FALSE RUMROS:
""the school is so bad""

TRUTH: 
In reality no, no it isn't. It's only some kids that make it look bad when really it's an amazing school and kids don't go around looking for fights. They mostly keep to themselves cuz we are awkward paranoid tweens and teens who don't want any trouble.

27Q210,Anonymous Ex210er,queens,Middle,1884,"Hello teachers, parents and current/past/future students of Middle School 210,

One year ago today, one of the worst things happened in my life at Middle School 210. I will not describe it but today, I have come to speak the truth, the full and complete truth of Middle School 210.

First off, I am, unfortunately, an alumni of this place I am not proud of.
Thank God I graduated in June (of 2015).

Let me tell you, I was in ARP and the teachers were pretty good. I would like to give a shout out to those teachers (who I should keep nameless to conceal my identity if they or anyone who I mention in this reads it) Some administrators and most Deans (specifically Mr. Yulfo) there are completely unreasonable and are obnoxious. Especially Mr. Yulfo. He thinks he's above everyone and is better than everyone. He has a superiority complex.

Although I was in ARP, the kids still did drugs. There are drugs EVERYWHERE in 210, you just gotta look closely.

Contrary to what the people said down below, fights don't happen very often. But they do happen. (Just stay out of people's business and don't cause any issues with fellow students) And when they do, it is usually an isolated situation between two people who most likely had previous beef (issues). In my experience, the teachers were nice and fair but the students are backstabbers and fake.

Watch out for fake friends or people, because trust me, they can and will 
turn on you IN A HEARTBEAT. IN AN INSTANT. Everyday, I dreaded being in that place and I prayed every night it would be over. And when it was, I was the 
happiest person ever.

********************
FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THINGS IN TERMS OF ACADEMICS: 
The school has an Advanced Regents Program that allows students to take the
 Living Environment Science/Common Core Algebra Regents in the 8th 
Grade. As well as Spanish I and II in 7th and 8th grade.
•Homework is usually in medium level, 2 hours if you understand the material and concepts
•STUDY HARD FOR THE REGENTS !!! (ESPECIALLY OUT OF SCHOOL, AT HOME) I received an 87 on the Living Environment Regents and 79 on Math (and trust me, I don't get very good grades) I studied every other day for 1.5 hours. Half math and half science.
****************

TIPS IN GENERAL:
•STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. THE DEANS WILL PUNISH YOU VERY BADLY, EVEN FOR THE SLIGHTEST THINGS. ESPECIALLY MR. YULFO. IF YOU ARE WRONGFULLY PUNISHED OR ACCUSED, DEFEND YOURSELF! DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY THEM. TRUST ME, IT'S HAPPENED TO ME. (THAT IS ONE THING I REGRET NOT DOING WHEN I LOOK BACK AT MY 210 YEARS)
•Most people (both ""good"" and bad kids) there might be cool with you or be your ""friend"", but they are just fake. Unless you have been friends with them since Kindergarten, TRUST NO-ONE!
•Mind your own business when people are doing bad OR POSSIBLY ILLEGAL things or things they SHOULDN'T be doing, just walk away. (THIS IS ANOTHER THING I REGRET NOT DOING. SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN AND IT WILL NOT, I REPEAT, WILL NOT END WELL FOR YOU OR ANYONE)
•Don't act like the sheep or act scared, be yourself and if someone pushes you around, defend yourself!
•Definitely do your homework and classwork but don't try TOO hard. Do it enough to get a good grade. 
•Get to school ON TIME, some Houses will penalize you for be late, possibly detention or parents being called.
•Read the first tip!!!

This school has taught me lessons that I will always take with me in the 
future (in terms of street smarts), it has made me tougher, and stronger in my experience. I will never forget the things that have happened 
there. 

Make TRUE friends, do your homework, stay strong and you will have a decent time!

First of all if your child is late, that's your problem. They should be standing outside in the cold, rainy or even hot day just so they can learn there lesson. So, the next time they will manage to come in time! I went to this school a while ago. Yes, i must say the environment has changed. But that's only because people has changed. Kids know more about bullying, drugs, alcohol, sex and etc that's what makes kids react to such things. Kids are more mature now. You see 6th graders, forget 6th graders 4th graders with cellphones. Who's fault is that? The society not the school itself.
The school is loaded with amazing teachers, and staff members!!! It is actually a very nice neighborhood and a safe one too.

27Q262,Rockaway Mom,queens,Middle,414,"Comments below are fairly old. My son has attended this school for the past two years, and I can say that it is a safe and caring environment, and the teachers are committed and enthusiastic. Coming from a Catholic school, he was shocked to find that it was equally, if not more, strict than his old school: the uniform code is narrow and there are few ""dress down"" opportunities, and students are never unattended in the building. However, the discipline is rooted not in punishments but in high expectations for achievement and good behavior. Students do seem to rise to those expectations. What's more, the teachers and other staff really push students to do their best, and to keep raising the bar for what their ""best"" might be. 


CVSR is housed on a large campus with other schools, but there is little interaction between them. My son has not had any incidents regarding safety, bullying, or general lack of respect since he started, and he feels completely safe in the building, as well as walking to and from school (we live a half mile away). There are metal detectors, and they cannot carry cell phones at all, so there was some apron string cutting to be done on my part, but he's a big boy and that's for the best if you ask me. 

Overall, we are very, very happy with Channel View, and I do recommend it to anyone in South Queens who is looking for a tightly focused and gimmick-free education for their child. Test scores reflect the fact that the school doesn't take just top performers--it accepts students of varying abilities who are hard workers and who have no disciplinary issues. There is an honors class in each grade, so advanced students can take 9th grade regents in 8th grade, an important factor if you are hoping to get into a competitive high school. But most kids do stay on through high school (CVSR goes from 6-12), with good reason.

27Q306,sue dev,queens,Elementary,360,"I have to agree that PS306 has not been the same since Flandro left.  The many wonderful teachers that started that school and made it a family have slowly dissipated.  The bonds they created with our children are priceless and immeasurable.  My oldest son was able to be a part of that complete warmth and love until 4th grade, but sadly my youngest was not.  If not for his friends and the teachers, I would have transferred him.  Up to recently I was asked ""When is Mrs. Flandro coming back, I miss her"", my oldest prayed that Mrs. Flandro would surprise them for graduation and be there, he said she should have been the one that was there, and he was so disappointed that the yearbook didn't even mention her, he said her picture should have been there in the front. His almost entire existence at 306 was with Flandro.  She knew how to treat her staff as well as the parents and children. 

It would always surprise me at events of how many of the teachers would be there with their family.  It was such a wonderful and rare thing.  I used to boast about how wonderful the school was and how much it felt like family, where all the teachers knew all the children and parents alike.  We were encouraged to be a huge part of our children's education at school as well, not just at home, and we were made to feel welcomed by the school.  The teachers and parents didn't mind putting in the extra time and effort because there was mutual respect and admiration for one another, and boy did the children benefit, so much love and concern at school from teachers...(I mean who ever heard of such a thing)...it seemed like something from the movies, but it was our wonderful reality. When it came down to it, Flandro would get to work with the teachers and help everything, even at the events.  She was a genuine, welcoming smiling face whenever you walked into the school and will be sorely missed.  She knew every child's name, their sibling and parent or relative. She was truly a leader.  She created a wonderful school and it is so sad to see what it has become. 

It feels so cold and uninviting now that I don't even feel comfortable calling in to ask questions anymore.  I used to be able to call the office and say ""Hi, my name is so and my kids are"", but before I could say who my kids were, Mrs. Basso, another great loss and wonderfully genuine smile at the school, would say, Hi. Ms. so and so, and she already knew who I was.  But even if she didn't know my name you could tell she was smiling and easy to talk to.  I pray that Mr. Kalamaras, another great leader at the school does not go, as well as the other wonderful teachers there.

I hope the Board of Ed really takes into consideration what the parents are saying and takes notice and even question why so many teachers who were here from the opening of this school are now suddenly leaving under new management.  Why are our teachers so unhappy after years of nurturing and happiness with our children and with Flandro.  

Many children have also lost the respect that Flandro instilled in the kids when she was there.  You wouldn't see kids running in the hall or shouting out.  She taught the kids to have respect for everyone, teachers, parents and each other.  She also made sure kids kept their hands to themselves, no hitting or touching, playing or otherwise.  Her motto, ""We keep our hands and feet to ourselves"".

I can only hope that the chance to revert the negative comes soon through communication, flexibility, understanding, and above all unconditional love and care for the children, because at the end of the day, money and reputation will never replace the sincere admiration, gratitude, cooperation and love that we used to have. My suggestions, make the children feel welcome, Mr. Kalamaras was always outside in the mornings waiting for them, Mrs Flandro was always talking to the children, she showed them love and respect, Mrs Marino an excellent teacher. Leadership is not just a title, a salary, ego, or a benefit, leadership is a skill, is being able to be flexible, is know how to listen, and care, leadership is about be a fair team player, and most of all an approachable person so that all the people below will have the encouragement to work together and keep us parents supporting their hard work and goals.

27Q309,Emely Martinez-Pichardo,queens,Middle,226,"I am currently a rising 8th grader who attended this school for approximately 2 to 3 weeks. However short my time was, I still have a vague idea of how this school treated me. The teachers were incredibly respectful; however, they moved quite slowly, and I often found myself bored within the classes. As this school does not offer advanced programs/classes in middle school, I dreaded having to come. I also recall having to wait in line for the metal detectors, making the place seem more like a prison than a school. A school needs two main things: emotional support and academic support. AMT has only fulfilled the emotional support, and I feel that their academics in their middle school program could have been much better.

You complain about text books, yet you would prefer your child to ""memorize"" what is being dictated, rather than learn and apply what is being taught by a different learning style.

27Q323,Olivia M,queens,Middle,660,"I graduated Scholars' middle school in Spring of 2016. Although I left to attend Bard High School Early College Manhattan, I keep in close contact with those of my friends who stayed for the high school. In complete honesty, leaving Scholars (not staying for the high school) was the best decision I ever made going into adolescence. Yes, the school is rated high for diversity, but it handles that diversity SO poorly. Racism, sexism, anti-semitism, xeno-phobia and queerphobia is rampant, there is no concern for mental health of students, and administrators/teachers, in mine and my friends' experience, have never done anything to deal with this. The amount of rules that restrict students from expressing themselves to the most basic extent are absurd- separate academic and gym uniforms are required, and students are asked to pay a dollar if they want to wear normal clothes on assigned ""dress-down days."" Even then, there are rules prohibiting self-expression; the Parent Handbook (accessible on www.scholarsnyc.com) states that students can be punished for wearing things considered ""disruptive"" or ""inappropriate,"" such as scarves, jewelry, any piercings, any dyed hair (even natural colors), and skirts (of no specified length). Students wearing shirts that are considered ""political,"" i.e. graphic tees with slogans of movements such as ""Black Lives Matter"" or even ""Love Wins,"" may be asked to **take their shirt off or miss class until their parents can come to school with new clothes for their child.** The Arts Department is extremely underfunded, with the theatre department only allowed $500 a semester to produce shows with complete sets, props, costumes, sound, and lighting, while the Athletics department is overfunded, receiving annual grants for new uniforms. Juuling and Vaping are also extremely popular among both high school and middle school students. In my time at Scholars, I have had person experiences with explicit anti-semitism, queerphobia, and a lack of concern for my mental instability. In reality, the social environment of Scholars' Academy is geared towards the prosperity of cisgender-heterosexual, white kids who are good test-takers and come from supportive middle-class families. Nonetheless, if you/your child prioritizes the school's academic and athletic reputation over the social environment and a promotion of critical thought/self-expression/self-exploration a child may need as they edge closer to adolescence, the Scholars' Academy may be a place where you/your child can thrive.",1,0,0,2018-10-28T20:14:53,1.0,0.002,0.111,0.0,0.882,0.017,0.235,0.259,0.136,0.182,0.408,0.032

There was an incident that occurred on January 19,2011 with my second grade child Abigail and her teacher Ms Qianie Dolvin. Ms Dolvin saw a rash on Abigails face and asked Abigail what is that on ur face my daughter states I think its wing worm ms Dolvin stood up n the front of the class and told all the students to put away there books and clean there desk because Abigail has wing worm and she’s spreading her germs around the class and due to her comment to the class my daughter was teased and taughted for three days and came home Friday jan 21 2011 and said to me ”mommy no one wants to b my partner on the trip” so I ask her why and that’s when she told me what ms Dolvin did… I was very up set so I called her school an the secretary told me all staff members are gone so she took my statement. So Monday morning I went up to the school to follow up on this problem I spoke to two staff member but I didn’t feel secure in what was going to happen so I asked for the principle. The principle  (Angela logan) came out her office and my husband asked her for a minute of her time an she said I don’t have a minute for you so her asked again an told her y and she stated what do u want me to do! I will investigation and get back to you my husband and I being very uneasy with the issue left the school. I called 311 to make a formal complaint on the teacher and the principle due to the disrespect and attitude we received. The school distric rep call me the next day telling me because the teacher said she didn’t say it there nothing they can do.My husband call the school to set up a meeting with the teacher and the principle on jan 24 2011 because no one ever got back to us, the secretary gave him an appointment for jan 25 2011. My husband and I showed up for the appointment only for the principle of the school to come out her office an say I will not meet with u because u called in a complaint on me so I will not meet with you. So I was upset so I told her to do her job and stop being so emotional this is about my child, she called for security and said get her out my office. So I sat in the auditorium until my husband came out. I got home and called 311 once again only to get a call later that day and have a lady tell me because I didn’t respect the principle they wont follow throw with my daughters problem at the school. So I ask what am I to do when my child get ostracized by her teacher and then the teacher lies the principle doesn’t care about what goes on in her school and the district doesn’t do any type of investigation but ask the accuser what happen an take there word  for it. What about the problem at hand, My child was ostracized by someone that she is defenseless again and no one seems to care.

28Q099,Parent,queens,Elementary,781,"I am very happy with this school. I think that the Principal is doing an outstanding job, as are the teachers and other administrators. I see a very strongly coordinated effort to make sure that the children are being taught not only on an intellectual level, but also an interpersonal level. Being able to get along and communicate with one's peers is critical in today's world. The caliber of education that my children are receiving is excellent. I know because I've done my research.  I, also, appreciate that the principal, teachers, and administrators are instilling a strong work ethic via homework and other projects ----- a strong work ethic that will be carried by our children into adulthood. My children are given a chance, on a regular basis, to exercise at the school's playground. It is a small playground, but the staff manages the play period well. I know because I've made it a point to stand outside, and actually watch what is going on in the playground. I also appreciate that sound eating habits that are encouraged. I know a lot about what is going on at the school because I speak with my children every day, and I ask them about what is going on at the school. I also make it a point to reach out to the teachers with any questions, and they are diligent about responding.  The Parent Coordinator has been very helpful in directing me to the appropriate parties if I have any concerns outside of classroom activities. I have also spoken to other staff members, and they have been very helpful. The Principal has instituted a very good chain of command at the school, and has surrounded herself with an excellent staff. As such, any concerns I may have had were addressed quite well.  I appreciate the organized fashion in which the principal runs this school, and the discipline she insists on.  I feel very confident that the well-balanced approach that the principal is utilizing in managing this school, is preparing my children for the rigors of the work world in the future. I also feel confident that my children will succeed in life because of the superb partnership I have in our very dedicated staff, teachers, and excellent Principal.",0,0,0,2010-11-15T23:47:17,1.0,0.124,0.215,0.049,0.858,0.13699999999999998,0.49200000000000005,0.23600000000000002,0.057999999999999996,0.387,0.26899999999999996,0.145

-Class size in most grades is now 30+ kids as almost all grades that had about 100 kids in 4 classes (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th) are combined into 3 classes.
-Only ""seniors"", which were 6th graders and going forward will be only 5th graders, have opportunity to participate in the school play.  No other theater is taught at 101.
-4th, 5th and 6th graders have had no art instruction AT ALL until the 2012-2013 school year, when they went from nothing to art sometimes every other week (and sometimes not at all).
-4th and 5th grades participate in a truly wonderful ballroom dancing program, but there is no other dance at the school.
-Physical Education at 101 is truly ""education"", in that the kids spend 90% of time writing in their notebooks and really only get to run around when there's a substitute teacher.  The school is very good at picking select programs, like ""Mighty Milers"", to get good public relations spin for something to hold up as how great their PE program is.
-Hot lunch food is truly inedible (my kids eat anything/everything and they refuse to eat the school food).
-Afterschool program is run by the PA, which is comprised overwhelmingly of stay at home parents.  The program offers a nice break for stay at home parents who need a little extra time in the afternoon as it runs only part of the school year (starting a month or so after September school year start and ending about a month before last day of school) and adds an additional 1 1/2 hours of occupied kid time after school dismissal (afterschool is over at 4:30).  Kids enroll on a semester basis and there is no ability to participate in the program on a ""drop in"" or one day basis.  Unlike many other elementary schools' afterschool program, PS 101's does nothing to accommodate needs of working parents.
-101's PA does hold meetings sometimes in the early morning and sometimes in the evening, and PA touts this as accommodate to working parents.  Diversity of PA meeting time is mandated by DOE.",5,0,0,2013-07-23T16:38:08,1.0,0.040999999999999995,0.14800000000000002,0.011000000000000001,0.312,0.011000000000000001,0.11199999999999999,0.295,0.028999999999999998,0.177,0.42,0.102

Insiders are those who volunteer and donate a lot; outsiders are everybody else. You're wrong on this and it's part of what's holding 101 back: 101 is a public school and is is there to serve, not a school co-op and not there to be served.

101 answers to the citizens and parents, not the other way around.
But yes, yes I did do a lot of volunteering, donating, giving up work clients to work as a recess volunteer, etc. And when I did, I heard your attitude expressed many times by people in power. Any time a problem came up in conversation with an ""enfranchised"" person ... staff member, PA Officer, volunteer ... they would sing the chorus about how parents have to go about complaining the right way and that you don't go about complaining if you haven't volunteered and donated.

The children I saw were never shoved, nor ripped away from parents, nor did they get chastised for asking for some more, Sir.  My child loved school, loved his teacher amd loved his principal.  He is very much looking forward to first grade as well. Nearly all the children seemed to feel the same way.  Certainly there were a few exceptions, and a few children continued to cry right until to the very last day, but, invariably, those very same children (at least in my child's class)  were happy and engaged by the time I saw them during school activites like Friday Sweet times, during which parents may come to class and read, do a craft, etc., with the kids.

Other schools have principals who say no, there are no parents allowed in the auditorium on rainy days because the aides ""need time alone with the kids"" (why is anyone's guess,) and no, children are not allowed to take books into the auditorium during Sponge Bob time or the book will be confiscated.
There are even principals right within this very district who say Yes Please, we DO want parents helping 4-year-olds to open their milk cartons at lunch, and Yes Please, we'd love to have parents start a volunteering rotation inside the clasroom because we don't have enough school aides and our classes are enormous.

28Q101,SaneMomNo9,queens,Elementary,654," Good for you! They must have fixed their first day of school problem. Apparently it was well-ordered, friendly, organized, and made the children feel welcome.
So the kindergarten teacher called each child by name, greeted them with their parents, and had them all together as a group before they walked upstairs together? The Kindergarten teacher knew exactly which kids were there that day and which were not before leaving the gym where the parents were? Glad to hear it.
Also glad that your child liked Developmentally Inappropriate Kindergarten. It IS good for a few kids. Of course, research shows that it's not the best education, but we wouldn't want our schools to be driven by -- um - scholarly research, right?
Instead, most parents either think their kid is too smart for a play-based program (even gifted children should learn through discovery play at age 5) or are afraid they'll give the impression that their kid isn't smart because they advocate for play. I got that; my kid is plenty smart, but everyone told me that maybe my child wasn't ""ready"" for academic kindergaten.
Hey, what can I tell you. One of the things I learned in public school was how to do research; and the research shows that playful kindergarten leads to -- drumroll please -- higher test scores.

28Q101,SaneMomNo9,queens,Elementary,654,"The school has now learned the consequences of hiring someone who is connected rather than someone who has a strong intellect. This is a neighborhood full of doctors, lawyers, academics, journalists, entrepreneurs, investment bankers and other highly urbane, sophisticated hardworkers. It needs a principal with the guts to stand up before a crowd of parents and actually answer questions as if this is a modern institution -- this is not the 1950s where the principal spoke and everyone bowed down. Parents expect accountability, not just to the DOE but to the taxpaying public.
It needs a principal who is willing to examine curriculum and make changes and admit mistakes, whether the mistake is made by the principal or a staff member.
Most of all, it needs a principal who treats children as if this is the 21st century, not London under Dickens.
These are children being educated, children who need to be guided over time into correct school behavior with an appropriate school-readiness program in Kindergarten. Many schools have open houses on the first day where parents can visit the classroom with the children; 101 just shoves everyone into the gym and then the 4- and 5-year olds either run to find their teacher or are ripped from their parents at the door.
When a first grader is throwing a tantrum at the door of the school in late November, as I witnessed last year, the solution must go beyond a call to the parents and punishment for the child.

28Q101,Jenny ,queens,Elementary,654,"PS 101 seems far from a way to an ""A""...by discontinuing their account with Artsonia where every child is an ""artist"".  Only a few pieces of artwork and ""artists"" are named on a weekly basis on USTREAM.  They used to stream the PTA meetings on a monthly basis, which I found to be quite informative and convenient since I work...but that has been discontinued as well, for whatever reason.  A strong music program or perhaps chorus for all grades would be a tremendous benefit because by reading the lyrics, children will learn to read in no time.  The after school program needs revamping.  I would not hesistate to enroll my child, if the program offerings were creative and enriching.  Do we really need 3 martial arts programs? children need to be challenged with fun and educational programs like instrumental lessons, robotics and chess from 1st grade & up [god knows we need it based on our math scores], modern dance or glee or kids, basketball lessons, more language lessons [french, chinese] and science experiments.  Next,  science and social studies, boy do we need to pull up those test scores.  A $4-$5 fee per child from 1st grade - 5th grade should be included on the supply list so that each class may subscribe to Kids Discover magazine, which will enhance PS 101's science and social studies curriculum.  The teacher can make photocopies of the articles and have the children read, summarize in writing and quiz them on a bi-weekly basis.  Lastly, teachers have a difficult time bringing the class up to standards if they have to teach a class of 24 children of various reading and math abilities.  The advanced children are left to work on their own, while the teachers spend most of the day/week bringing the others up to speed.  Starting from 1st grade - 5th grade, divide the children into 2 advanced classes and 2 average classes.  It is a win win situation for the teachers and parents.  If I was a parent with a child in an average class, you bet I will push my child to work a little harder to make it to the advanced class the following year.  This will bring us from a ""C"" grade to an ""A"" grade in no time...otherwise the bright kids from 3rd - 5th grade will leave for better schools in other districts.    ",2,0,0,2012-03-20T05:17:53,1.0,0.040999999999999995,0.14800000000000002,0.011000000000000001,0.312,0.011000000000000001,0.11199999999999999,0.295,0.028999999999999998,0.177,0.42,0.102

How about having the after school program start when school starts in September and running on same schedule as school (and not starting mid-Semester in October and ending before the last day of school)?  Or having after school program run until 6:00 every day so that it is truly available to working parents (and not until 4:30, which requires working parents to hire childcare)?  That's how it's done in most public elementary schools and not a crazy idea - just an idea beyond the conception of 101's PA.  My personal thing is to have field trips connect to our children's curriculum so that, for example, a third grade class studying the rain forest goes to the Museum of Natural History to see the Butterfly Exhibit and the Hall of Biodiversity - instead of to Sony Wonder to play video games and have no before or after trip discussion of the technology they saw.  Curriculum at 101 is flat and uninspired and taught wholeheartedly to the middle.  Agreed.",1,0,1,2012-07-15T23:18:48,1.0,0.040999999999999995,0.14800000000000002,0.011000000000000001,0.312,0.011000000000000001,0.11199999999999999,0.295,0.028999999999999998,0.177,0.42,0.102

How they treat me tells the environment my child will be in. If office staff has an attitude, how are teachers? If office staff can not show my child w/ a warm smile, how do teachers respond? If it is unpleasant for a parent to deal w/ your office staff, how unpleasant will it be to deal teachers? I understand that I can't  generalize what teachers will be based on an unhappy woman.The school atmosphere is reflected by every staff.Again, this is my experience &no one else has to agree.When I experience rude people,I don't get warm fuzzy feeling.P.S. 121 should want the parents feel good their child is in this school not that they have to choose this school(b/c there is no other choice).",0,0,0,2013-06-21T23:50:57,1.0,0.044000000000000004,0.133,0.037000000000000005,0.855,0.031,0.535,0.54,0.16899999999999998,0.131,0.019,0.264
