McAuliffe is a school that is filled with teachers who are passionate about their subjects.  I often marveled about the number of truly experienced teachers under one roof.  Although each Academy has different electives, the core subjects are the same.  Subject departments meet to discuss curricula and Academies meet to discuss how to best meet the needs of their students.  Due to the Academy system, the school is basically 3 small schools within a larger one.  This atmosphere allows students to get a lot of personal attention.  It is true that many students do a lot of extracurricular academic work; however, my son did not and was able to be extremely successful in his academic endeavors.  The majority of graduates do attend Specialized and/or Screened High Schools.  This is a school for earnest students and families who take their child's education seriously.  Additionally, the school has a strong community with Parents and extended family enjoying potluck dinners, together.

The school should appreciate the heavy population of Asian students and their parents. It wouldn't be able to keep good grades and high ranking without those kids' great contribution on extra studies and homework from private classes after school and on the weekends. Not from the teachers, period. I don't think most of them are good educators. The English curriculum has never really worked out. To my kid’s academy, for example, during the last two years, if without some serious writing homework from one of the teachers (non-ELA subject), I don’t think those kids could write anything good after middle school.\nThe most unpleasant thing about this school is that the attitude from some of the teachers, including the administration is unacceptable. They prefer to simply send the students to the administration office without caring to talk to them. If you want your kid be treated as a kindergardener, be quiet, and listen and follow,  then this is the right school for them. If not, then  you’d better be ready to hear something uncomfortable about your child, making you feel like your kid had done something unforgivable. Don’t get me wrong, my child is an honor student.

Honestly, this school sucks so bad, it\'s a joke. Out of the many kids that graduated, approximately 10 kids (should be a little less than that) received admission into a specialized high school, that\'s not the worst part, the teachers don\'t give the attention needed to failing students, they just spoon feed us the information, they act like they care, but yet they don\'t (this does not apply for EVERY teacher)My class ( I can\'t say from the others but I\'m sure it wasn\'t only my class) was, how can I say, lustful. This guy who got a 1 on the math state test, instead of actually realizing he\'s failing school and should help his grades, just disturbs the class with sexual noises with others laughing and joining him hoping to drag everyone else down with him. I barely saw the principal in my 3 years of attending this school, less than 10 times I guess? It was like the assistant principals did everything. I appreciate the dean\'s help on trying to discipline students when they do wrong, but she does it the wrong way. She instills fear into them hoping they would do right instead of just asking the guidance counselor for help, not like the guidance counselor does much either. We had no recreational activities to interest us to learn, no field trips (like BARELY), my class personally never had any field trips except something like six flags when we were graduating. In 6th grade our English teacher just made us feel bad she didn\'t take us to the aquarium and mocked us because we were talkative, like hell, she put it in our faces for a whole week before she went. There were some memorable teachers, but I do not prefer their teaching, for example, in 6th grade, our Social Studies teacher let us play on the laptop for the last 2 months before summer instead of actually learning something useful. Sure, I might have enjoyed it at the time, but I still don\'t agree with what he did.The atmosphere is also intense, we have certain kids trying to pick fights with others and we have others who were extremely invective. We had our 8th grade English teacher saying that 10 years ago, it was way worse, but it still is. I almost had to ask my parents to call 311 because my class and several others stayed in the auditorium because some of us kept talking and by the time we got to eat, we had 2-5 minutes to eat, which is barely enough time to have a proper lunch, which I can personally say doesn\'t feel legal to me, nonetheless the fact that our grade was the last grade to eat lunch, so we were hungry enough. I mean I was fully aware that some people in my class were failing some subjects in school, I was also fully aware that if I knew, I\'m pretty sure that the teacher could figure it out too considering she has all the test scores and etc. And yet we were denied any REAL help with issue we have in mind. Hell, in 8th grade, I have to say my math teacher was a nice person, in times, but I felt like screaming at times when she threatened to call my parents for using the word ""Hate"" in her class in the context of hating group work, because at times my group was full of slackers. The ONLY, AND I MEAN ONLY, memorable teacher I had if anyone was my 7th grade math teacher, who at the time when he became my math teacher was his first year teaching, and you know what most of my class mates did? They exploited that fact, and talked all year long and misbehaved when he tried his best to help them excel in their work.\nI know this school is one of the many that are not the worst, but I truly hated this school with all my heart, I liked some of my friends that I made but if I ever came back to this 3 years worth of memory in my life, I would not enjoy recalling it.', 'Nice']"

My opinion that this is a great school and the fact that I would recommend it to anyone has not changed. But I cannot stress enough that my own mental state during 7th grade was not a byproduct of the teachers. It was my own perfectionist and stubborn nature which led to the crippling anxiety and stress I felt. I know many other people who were able to get averages which were 90 and above, which handled the situation a lot better than I did . After my one week break I will start studying for the SHSAT and Bard entrance exam. I know i'll try even harder next year to get VERY high grades because i'll be attempting to be valedictorian.

20K686,"['Speaking as a former student here, 8th grade class of 2017. Highly do not suggest this school for many reasons. As a disclaimer, the former principal Donna Taylor left the same year I did, so I cannot speak to the recent or current experience at the school. At the same time I don\'t believe it possible for the school culture to drastically change or shift in a few years. \n\nIssue #1: The academics. BSI masquerades behind the facade of ""good"" test scores, and a rigorous education, but it left me duly unprepared for the high school I ended up attending. BSI has no mandatory homework, instilling a sense of perpetual laziness amongst the student body, with no desire or motivation to really complete work. Sure, some kids are naturally driven to complete good work, and they do, but a lot of kids don\'t. While not giving homework falls in line with the ""untraditional"" ethos of the school, it just ends up disadvantaging students later on. \n\nIssue #2: Student behavior. Racism, sexism, and homophobia were rampant amongst the student body. No exaggeration there. From the 5th graders up to the 8th graders, this type of behavior was tolerated by the guidance counselor and administration, and never punished. Students have a complete disregard for authority and the teachers and administration allowed for such an environment to grow. I guess it made sense during my time at the school considering our principal made racist remarks to prospective parents on a school tour. \n\nIssue #3: Facilities. BSI is a small school with only 1 or 2 classes a grade, meaning a personalized and individualized education... right? Nope. It\'s a K-8 school crammed into 1.5 floors of a school building. The gym is shared, the library is shared, the cafeteria is shared. My spanish class of 25-30 students was held in a literal broom closet, no one had chairs or desks and everyone sat on the floor. Even in general classes like Math and Humanities, there were not enough desks for students and students had to sit in the back of the room working against a wall, more or less. The building looks nice from the outside, and the halls, bathrooms, and classrooms are less dingy than traditional NYC public schools -- but that doesn\'t mean much considering how cramped we are. \n\nIssue #4: Faculty. It would be inaccurate of me to say I did not have good teachers at BSI. Most of my teachers cared about what they taught and cared about their students. What\'s unsettling to me however, is the high turnover rate in teachers. I recall between the year I entered and the year I graduated, most of the teachers who were thoughtful and committed to their work, ended up leaving to go onto other schools. Not to mention the former principal who was offered a lucrative job at the DOE despite citing Spanish learning as necessary for students so they can communicate with their ""housecleaners""... Go figure. I don\'t know the status and quality of the current batch of teachers, but I know in my time the good teachers did not stick around. \n\nIssue #5: Academics again. The whole ethos of the school is not to teach for tests and not to drill work... most of 7th and 8th was spent preparing for the NYS regents. \n\nTAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. I don\'t know if the school and it\'s culture has changed or how much it\'s changed. It could be a completely different place now than it was before! This is simply my experience from the years of 2014-2017 as a middle schooler. My assessment may be nowhere near the current realit', 'Does attending BSI or Q300 lower your chances to attend a screened middle or high school?\nIs this the case for other citywide G&Ts?  \n\nOur child is a 5th grader at a citywide G&T that falls in the category of BSI and District 30 (Q300).  Our child’s fourth grade report card was all 4s, state test scores were double 4s (ELA/Math) and perfect attendance. We put NEST+m first on the application list for middle school as it is geographically easier to get to for us, but our child is on the wait list behind more than 200 other applicants.  We are content staying at our current school as it goes to 8th grade, but what caught our eye is the selection criteria/ factors for selection to NEST+m middle school.  Specifically for students from BSI and District 30 (Q300) where the “Performance Indicators” is weighted at 20% whereas at other schools it is less or not a factor at all.  We asked our current elementary school and they had no idea what “Performance Indicators, as assessed by the elementary school” is, nor did they report anything other than: report card grades, attendance and state test scores for admissions.  \n\nDoes anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is?  And why are the Performance Indicators weighted the highest (20%) for BSI/ District 30 Q300?\n\nDoes anyone know the percentage of ""Performance Indicators"" for Anderson and TAG?  Is it 20% as well?\n\nWe realize that students from other districts/ schools may be less represented at NEST+m so can understand the need to give different weights and have different criteria to obtain diversity at NEST+m middle school.  At the same time, we feel that parents should be aware of the process/ criteria so they can make informed decisions.  We are simply looking for transparency.  Parents considering/ deciding on an elementary or middle school like BSI or Q300 (or other G&Ts) would probably like to know how their current decisions will affect their future options.\n\nThat said, are “Performance Indicators” used in the high school admissions process?   \n\nSpecifically: do screened high schools use the same criteria/Performance Indicators?  Ie. Millennium, Baruch, Lab School, Bard, Beacon and Nest+m high school.  Or was it purely based on merit for admissions announced in 2020?  \n\nPicture quality is low as InsideSchools has a format/size constraints.\n\n https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf28640d031b894277032bf88e80757547021e66683b247eca7791cd6bdcb513.jpg', 'By the time your child reaches middle or high school, screened admissions may be a thing of the past-------\nhttps://nypost.com/2020/05/02/doe-could-end-screening-for-top-nyc-schools-after-coronavirus-pandemic/', 'If your child is 200 on a waiting list it is a waste of effort to find the reason why he was not accepted to NEST. If he were in the single digits on the wait list then it might be worth the effort. The question you ask should be posed to NEST rather than other schools that in all likelihood would brush you off as they a)don’t know what a competing school’s admit criteria is, b) don’t want to lose a high performing student. Perfect 4’s all around is great but as you can see many others score the same and it is no slam dunk to get into a school that probably has no space for incoming 6th graders to begin with.', 'Exactly. That is my point. We completely agree with you that there are thousands of children out there with similar scores.  That is why we listed our child’s scores and stated the position on the waitlist to show how competitive it is.  To give a point of reference. \n\nOf course there were more applicants than seats at NEST+m middle school.  There are always more applicants than seats for the city-wide Kindergarten seats as well and all city-wide seats go through middle school.  \n\nTo achieve diversity schools are increasing the chances for children from certain districts and schools and since it is zero-sum they are lowering the chances of children from certain districts and certain schools.  It looks like BSI/Q300 are on the list of schools where their chances are lowered.  How?  If many children have all 4s on report card and double 4s on state test the admissions at the schools change the weights by district such that some will be favored.  When you have thousands of applicants and very few seats you can go the straight merit/ score route or the lottery route. If you want certain outcomes you weight certain factors more than others to get the desired results.  \n\nAs we said we are content at our current school.  We are simply using the NEST+m results as an example as to what can and might happen in the high school admissions.  Our primary concern/ question is whether this has happened in high school admissions to other citywide G&T students.  Have BSI 8th graders experienced this and at which schools?  Bard and Baruch have changed their admissions in a different way.\n\nhttps://ny.chalkbeat.org/2019/9/27/21121861/two-coveted-manhattan-high-schools-lab-and-baruch-tweak-their-admissions\n\nPeople considering whether to attend BSI as a kindergartner might want to know whether they are unknowingly lowering their child’s chance to earn a seat at a screened high school.  That could happen if other high schools purposely convolute their process. \n\nhttps://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/4/23/21233687/aiming-for-greater-student-diversity-in-nyc-gifted-programs-the-anderson-school-tweaks-admissions\n\nhttps://ny.chalkbeat.org/2019/10/23/21121803/parents-were-surprised-to-find-an-admissions-change-on-anderson-school-s-website-but-officials-say-i\n\nAnderson changed their admissions as well.  Looks like many of the G&Ts and screened schools are going this direction.  \n\nI think that there should be transparency in admissions so that everyone understands and knows the process so that everyone can make informed decision.  I am looking to see if others have insights/ knowledge to the process on the high school admissions.', '""Does anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is? And why are the Performance Indicators weighted the highest (20%) for BSI/ District 30 Q300?""\n\nI\'m not sure how you are reaching your conclusions unless you\'ve figured out exactly what the ""Performance Indicators"" are. After all, how do you know whether they might raise or lower your child\'s composite on any given school\'s final rubric score? In other words, if your child had a perfect score on whatever that measurement is, then he or she would receive the whole 20% for that part of the rubric. How could that hurt in chances of admissions?\n\nMy child is in a school in District 2. For fourth grade, he had all 4s on his final report card, 4s on the state test (4.09, 4.14), and four absences. District 2 has one other component that can be evaluated for screened schools: social growth and work habits (perseverance, asks for help, etc., where my son also had high scores). But as I understand NEST+m\'s rubric, the only factors are grades, state test scores, and attendance. My son is 300+ on NEST+m\'s waitlist, and I\'m attributing that to his test scores. If he\'d received 4.5s on both, then he would be higher up the waitlist.\n\nLike you, I\'ve been trying to find greater transparency in this whole process of applying to schools in NYC. It\'s been frustrating! My son received his fifth choice of middle schools, and his waitlist placements have not been encouraging. At his top choice, where he received a 98.3 on its rubric, he is 44th on the waitlist. Another school, where he received a 98 on the rubric, he\'s 93 on the waitlist--and the school has less than 100 seats for sixth grade. Another, 66th on the waitlist.', 'beardobees-\n\nWe are navigating the middle school process for the first time and trying to figure it out.  We presume that the high school process will be more convoluted and are trying to glean insights so we can be aware of the options.\n\nThe logic behind my theory about the purpose of ""Performance Indicators"" is that the trend of admissions at screened and G&T schools has been to change the criteria such that underrepresented districts get seats at highly sought after schools.  Seeing that BSI/Q300 (both City-wide schools) had the same 20% weighting for ""Performance Indicators"" with the description of it being purposely vague we presume that they would not try to INCREASE the chances of those two schools.  We are looking for insights to see if our theory is correct.  Basically we are hoping that if that is what it is why doesn\'t NEST+m simply state that is the case?  The rubric from the NEST+m site is dated and clearly didn\'t match up with what we received in the results.  What was district 2\'s ""Performance Indicator""?  What other districts were listed on your results?  \n\nBSI- proudly states its diversity of admissions.  Baruch and Lab are also listed.  All of the schools should do the same and be transparent about their process.  \n\nhttps://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enrollment-help/meeting-student-needs/diversity-in-admissions\n\nAsdgf-\nIt was a typo when I wrote Bard- as we meant to write Lab.  That said, per the above link Bard in Queens does have a diversity program as well-\n\nBard High School Early College Queens (24Q299) | Program Code: Q74B | Priority to applicants eligible for Free or Reduced Price Lunch (based on family income) for 63% of seats\n\nIt would not be shocking if Bard in Manhattan followed suit sooner or later.  \n\nAlso- to your point of ""No one will turn down an offer from BSI for what might or might not happen in 9 years"" point.  We 100% agree.  If someone receives an offer to BSI they obviously already made the decision/ first step to attend the school.  The question we will never know if if there are people who do not LIST BSI and what the reason is.  We will never know whether it is because of what might/might not happen in 9 years, issues with the new principle, location, etc... \n\nBSI will continue to admit great students who agree with the philosophy of the school.  We really like BSI.  We are simply asking questions/ looking for information and seeing if others from BSI have seen/ heard or experienced the same for middle school admissions and more importantly about the high school admissions process.', ""So I'm really trying to understand you here. Is your theory, based on the program/district where your child attends (BSI and District 30 (Q300)), he or she was subjected to a rubric for admissions by NEST+m that is unique to that program/district? \n\nNEST+m says its admissions rubric (and, I'm assuming, how it orders its waitlist) is based on these three factors: grades (55%); attendance (5%); and state test scores (40%) (what I'm also assuming here is a student only receives the full 40% if he or she gets 4.5/4.5 on the state tests; anything from 4.0 to 4.49 lowers the percentage). \n\nBut you're saying your child was evaluated on the following rubric for NEST+m: grades (35%); state test scores (35%); attendance (10%); and performance indicators (20%)?\n\nAnd the photo is showing that other districts also had unique rubrics for admission into NEST+m? So, for instance, if a child attends school in District 11, the rubric NEST+m used was this: grades (35%); state test scores (35%); attendance (10%); punctuality (5%); and performance indicators (15%)?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, my child's school has these four quantifiable factors on his report card that can be fed into a computer for each screened school's rubric: grades; state test scores; attendance; and social growth and work habits. District 2 doesn't have performance indicators--or if it does, we haven't been made aware of them. \n\nNEST+m had possibly hundreds of applicants who earned the full 55% for grades (straight 4s are common) and the full 5% for attendance (it's 10 day or less). So the only factor for differentiating applicants at the school is the state test scores. For my child, with 4.09 and 4.14, he's 300+ on the waitlist. You said in your original post that your child also received 4s on the state tests--so I'll assume he or she received higher state test scores (but not 4.5s), which is why he or she is waitlisted in the 200s. In the end, it's just really hard for me to believe NEST+m is using 14 or more rubrics to determine its admissions for possibly 10 middle school seats."", 'beardobees-\n\nExactly.  The reason we posted a picture of our child\'s results in the original post was to show the fact that Each District has its own rubric.  We were only shown the weightings for the listed Districts- i.e. District 2\'s weighting/ rubric was not listed.  We are curious to know what the weighting is for other districts.  In your results letter did you receive a sheet that showed District 2\'s weightings/ factors and that of other districts?  A sheet like the one that I posted in the original post. \n\nThe results that we received show that the rubric on NEST+m\'s site is not up to date.  Or they use it as a general rubric without the per district weightings.  Our point is/was how is ""Performance Indicators"" calculated.  Our child\'s school had the same 4 quantifiable factors, but from the results form ""Performance Indicators"" is an additional factor.  Our child\'s elementary school has no idea what it is and didn\'t report anything other than the report card grades/ state test scores/ attendance/ lateness.  Which makes us think that it is a district/ school ranking system done at the DOE or admitting school level.  \n\nPer the Chalkbeat story on Anderson, schools aren\'t as transparent as parent\'s would like.  We are only focusing on NEST+m, because it is our only example as this is our first time in a middle school admissions process and we want to understand the process as we presume that high school admissions will be similar.  Did other middle schools have the different admissions policies for students from other districts?\n\nMentioning our child\'s score/ place in the wait-list seems to have distracted from our main point.  Our primary motive isn\'t for our child to be moved up the list or to be placed at NEST+m.  Our goal is for more transparency in admissions.  To better understand the process/ system for admissions.  BSI does an exemplary job of being transparent about their admissions policy and gets students/ parents that subscribe to the idea/ philosophy and culture of the school.  We simply feel that all schools should do the same.  Not just NEST+m, but all of the schools at all levels/ boroughs.  In lieu of schools sharing their admissions policies we are hoping that parents can share their experiences/ insights so others can benefit from the knowledge.  The NEST+m middle school admissions info is for others to benefit from as we just went through the process and are sharing our experience.  People can use or not use the information that is for them to decide.  We simply are looking to gain more insights and hope that by digging deeper on this we can learn about how the admissions process is at the high school level because that is the next time we will start the process.', 'No one will turn down an offer from BSI for what might or might not happen in 9 years.\n\nNone of the articles you linked have any mention of Bard changing admissions procedures.', 'I just called the school to find out Kindergarten wait-list status.  After the she put me on hold for 15 min. she came back to ask me if I received a letter regarding the wait list.  I told her that I spoke with student enrollment and I was told to call each school to find out wait list status.  I also told her that I called each week since the G&T results came out to find out wait list status.   Then she said to me ""It was a wait of my time to look it up when you did not even have a letter from us.""  These people are rude.  Will the kids learn to be respectful other than good grade?', ""Last year, about 21 fifth graders left for other middle schools.

If you believe that lots of homework throughout elementary school is what makes smart kids smarter, then it is the wrong place for your family.

Kids in this school mainly care about appearance (like if you wear Gucci) and even though we have a no bullying policy, there is bullying.\nYou will find fights occurring occasionally in the hallways, which will become normal to you. In Latin, you don\'t learn Latin, it\'s basically another English class. Yes, people vape here, but it\'s really rare.

If you got accepted into Bay, just have fun! The best advice anyone can give is do all your homework, study for tests, be respectful, and you'll have a perfect experience. A little shout-out to the science and computer math departments, you guys were my favorite! <3"", ""If anyone is going to Bay, you don't have to stress too much. The first year is where teachers try to help you the best they can. That's the year you try to adjust. But, There are a lot of things you should know. For Latin, its not like you are actually learning Latin, you're only learning the prefixes and suffixes, not the actual language. For gym, the teachers honestly don't care how well you play or how talented at playing a certain sport you are. If you aren't having as much fun in this school as you thought you would, there are many different afterschool activities for you to join. If you like science, join Science Olympiad, where you get an opportunity to compete against schools and win medals. If you like sports, you can join the soccer team, boys basketball team, and/or the girls volleyball team. If you like cooking, there is a cooking club. There are other things that the afterschool program provides like music, dance, art, and the school is even introducing a student newspaper. Then, you get into 7th grade, where teachers will be very tough on you. They expect high 80's and 90's. This is because most schools like Goldstein, Midwood, and Beacon want those kinds of grades. If you are into art and you are really good at it, start making your art portfolio in order to apply for art programs for LaGuardia, Murrow, and other big schools. This also applies to people who are into performing arts (music, vocals, dance, drama). You should also find a shsat tutor, if you haven't already. The shsat gets you into specialized high schools, like Brooklyn Tech, Stuy, Brooklyn Latin, and Staten Island Tech. 7th grade is also when you should help monitor for teachers in order to get credits to get into arista/archon. Then, there is 8th grade, the year when everyone cries. Not just crying over the fact that it is their last year, but over other stuff as well. This is the year when you apply for high schools, when you get you results back, and when you graduate. Don't slack off in 8th grade, because your acceptance can be revoked. You should try to apply for arista/archon again and try to get very high 90's in as many subjects as possible. This is because you many receive an award during senior awards ceremony. On graduation, bring your arista archon pins from the past two yeas, bring you medals (Olympiad and Senior Awards), and be happy as you walk down to your seat. I hope you enjoy Bay Academy as much as I did."", 'are lockers there. :P', ""Hi, i'm not sure if you are already attending the school, but the answer is no.

The teachers are amazing, they take great care of their students and they do not get enough credit.  I have so much respect for all of these amazing teachers. For example, the amazing Mrs.Maiorana who makes english class fun and easy. She knows how to gain respect from her students while obtaining a high level of intelligence in her classroom without yelling at her students. She is hands down one of the greatest teachers a student can have and I am absolutely honored to be a part of her class. I hope she continues to teach her classes at such an amazing level as she does now. Other great teachers like Dr.Cubbin who help unleash the hidden talents of the science talent students. He inspires us each and everyday. He pushes us into competitions we never though we would be doing.Who ever knew that I could build a bridge that would rank internationally as #13? Thank you Dr.Cubbin for your daily inspiration and for pushing us to our full potential. Thank you to Mr.Souer for being an amazing teacher who makes science class fun by teaching us hacks on ipads after teaching biology to 8th graders. He is a true hero who deserves an award for his amazing teaching. Thank you to Mrs.Herman who (isn't even my scinece teacher) everyday welcomes other students into her room and teaches us. She invites girls from Science talent to her room and teaches us that girls deserve a chance in science and inspires us to achieve our dreams and reach for the stars and that boys are not dominant, we are.Thank you to Mr.Lilly who taught me earth science in 7th grade although I didn't do so well. He is an amazing teacher who deserves more respect for the difficult job he does. He is  absolutely phenomenal!!!!! He is very very bright ! I truly regret not listening to his wise words when in his class. he was an amazing teacher. Mr.Lilly, if you are reading this thank you for trying your best to accommodate me when my foot was broken and for sending me extra and advance notes to help me. Thank you for being such an amazing teacher. I hope you forever remain the amazing ecstatic, full of energy and life teacher that I was lucky enough to have in the 7th grade. Let's not forget Mrs.Koltunova, a rare species of teacher. She is one of the brightest people in the world. She is caring and calm. Her tranquility adds to our learning experience and it helps us progress in Algebra. She is brilliant because she writes songs for us to learn the material to. She is amazing and no wonder she has been teaching for the past 20 years at the Bay. I hope she lasts another 20 years because her brilliance will come in handy in the future. Ms.Reznik is amazing as well she is very close to all her students and she teaches well and thoroughly which shows on her state test results. Ms.Lord is another great teacher whom I greatly respect she may be strict but she gets things done in class and is great. I am in 831 a class with an overwhelming amount of boys in it,27, and they are very rude and Ms.Lord knows how to put them back in place. She is very special because she may seem mean but she is actually amazing. Mrs.Pernicone a Latin teacher who I'm now having for a second year is also very good. She doesn't teach Latin but she does a much more important job, teaching us affixes and Latin roots, giving us an advantage in english. She expects a lot for her students not academically but in a behavioral sense.Mrs.Pernicone is awesome because she is funny and although she may not seem to friendly at first she is. Now, I can go on for hours and hours about the amazing and brilliant minds who teach at the Bay all of whom are amazing teachers and people who care a great deal for the students. It saddens me that this is my last year at the Bay, but I graduate this year knowing that I went to the BEST middle school in the world. This school is truly the best and I highly recommend this phenomenal facility to others because it is really amazing.Please come here, everyone will care for you, parent or child, everyone fits in at bay and it is amazing. I cannot find words other than amazing, and phenominal to describe this school. Now, I hope i convinced you to come to this amazing school.

I really love the science classrooms especially, because they are well decorated. Homework depends on the teacher, although I didn't feel as if I got a lot, (there were days when none of my teachers gave homework) some kids say they get a lot. Though there will be days where you will be working on them for a while, so try not to do them at the last minute. So the amount of homework could range from nothing to a lot.

So if anyone from the school would like to tell me about the school, I'd be most happy."", ""Congratulations!  This school is not that good, but not too bad.  I graduated this year in the most unpredictable way.  I will say that these three years spent at boody was the best.  The teachers are very kind, and are always there for their students whenever they need help.  There are teachers who are a little more laid back than others which isn't always good, but now speaking on assignments, the assignments are not always as challenging as I first expected in my first year at boody.  Some assignments will be challenging depending on what teacher you have, I had the easy teachers.  This school also provides honors classes, and again, my expectations were nothing like how it turned out.  As a student who has been in honors for three years, the work isn't always more challenging than the work regular classes get.  The work only changes when you reach the eighth grade, if you get put into a regents class (instead of just 8th grade math, you get a combination of Algebra 1 which is high school level math, and regular 8th grade math.  Instead of 8th grade science, you take a combination of Living Environment which is also high school level, and regular 8th grade science.  You will also get Earth science if you choose to be in a science magnet.)  8th grade will be challenging, but it really isn't that bad if you put the effort in.  If you end up taking those classes in 8th grade, good job you'll earn high school credits!!  Enough of assignments, I'll speak on bullying!  The bullying in this school is not that intense, but I feel that most teachers and staff can't really do anything to help.  To avoid trouble and bullying, find good friends to hang out with, you can go for counseling, or you can join STOMP to have a chance to make new friends and have fun with staff!  It really is a shame that you won't be able to experience that full first year of middle school feeling, I'm sorry.  Alright, I hope this gave you a little insight of boody.  I hope you will like this school as much as I did!"", ""I'm going to be a 7th grader at Boody this September. So far this school is okay. Most of the teachers care about their students, and go out of the way to make their classes enjoyable. The 6th grade classwork could be slightly more challenging, but that's just my opinion. The dean isn't the greatest, but you get used to her. At lunch, they separated boys and girls on different sides of the cafeteria(meaning you could only eat lunch with your gender). The transition to remote learning was a chaotic but manageable one. However, only three of my teachers would host zoom meetings for help on the classwork, so kids who needed extra help didn't get much of it.\n\nBullying happens in this school. A friend of mine was targeted by a nasty group of girls that talked about her behind her back. We students don't know how to use the anti-bullying program BRIDG-IT to report incidents. Occasionally, there were fist fights.\n\nOverall, if you stay with the right crowd and focus on academics, you'll have a great experience at this school. Good luck in the fall!"", 'So am I! Nervous but excited. So sad that it will probably be remote learning though.', ""Currently i'm a student at this school 6th grade, and so far a lot of the students treat others like crap if they want to.  I've also been bullied by this group of kids who literally jumped at me in the playground pretending to attack me, (won't share their name) and the 6th grade staff didn't do a single thing about them. But this school has good teachers horrible staff and just some horrible students."", 'so am i! i don’t like it either and my classmates bully me.', 'A recent show, performed by David A Booty students, showcased the schools dance and music programs, as well as the school\'s internal and external collaborations, as reported by <a href=""https://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2018/20/bn-bb-david-boody-dance-show-2018-05-18-bk.html"">Brooklyn Daily</a>.', 'My daughter attended David Boody from grade 6 to 8 till 2017.  She has always been a straight A student since young age with all her grades above 95. She is a good kid and plays piano at a high level Mozart and Tchaikovsky. Now let me tell you about this school David Boody.  This is a good school only if your kid doesn\'t required the school staff or principal to provide extra attention to your child who is in the general education. Maybe because this school is overcrowded so the staff can\'t be bothered if your general ed child needs assistance.They took my daughter out of some of her programs and placed her in programs that she and I did not want her to be in without my consent or informing me. My daughter was miserable. Even after I wrote the school a few letters to have her switch back they said no and it wasn\'t due to because my daughter had bad grades. I guess because the school was crowded so only certain kids get ""better seat"" and my daughter her skin is not white. Nor do I have any inside connections or belong to their parent teacher association.  \nWhen I requested David Boody office staff and the teachers from their music department about the NYSMMA program from the New York state, they have no clue what I was talking about and told me they have nothing to do with it. They didn\'t provide me any help and were extremely incompetent. Very unprofessional.  New York state and the NYC board of education required the child\'s public school to provide information and application for  NYSMMA when parents make the request. I almost wrote a letter to the Board of education and district 21 to file a complaint against David Boody for their incompetent teachers and staff.   \nTheir school security guards are the rudest workers I have ever seen and one of the security guard even argued with me because my daughter arrived at their summer program at 7:30am instead of 8am for their breakfast which starts at 7:30am. He refused to let my daughter in and  told me my 7th grade daughter can\'t go inside for breakfast because no adult is supervising in the cafeteria and she should come back at 8am when class starts. I told him then the school should assign an adult because kids who attend summer school do eat breakfast at 7:30 provided by the city.  This went on the whole summer the guard was very rude to my daughter and me because my daughter wanted to eat school breakfast. I called the main office but they didn\'t do anything to rectify the problem. \nThese are just a few examples what is like being a parent with a child who attends David Boody. Your child in the general ed program doesn\'t  get any help unless the parents fight for it... even something so simple as eating school breakfast.   The school is located in a good neighborhood and the students most of them are from that neighborhood which is one of the two reasons why it is a good school. It\'s safe in a safe location. The second reason why it is a good school it\'s because David Boody gets lots of funding from working class taxpayers like me and you. They have good art,dance, and music programs. They have good afterschool programs. To get into programs that your child wants require the parents to put in efforts either get inside connections or be part of their parent teacher association. Try to get to know the staff to get inside info. The good programs get filled up quickly.  Don\'t expect the teachers, staff, and principal in David Boody to be excellent and go above and beyond. They are there because that\'s where they work.  In David Boody you should rely on yourself as a parent that your child is getting a good appropriate education and don\'t rely on the school staff. Some of the classes my daughter was put in the teachers can\'t teach and my daughter ahd to teach herself from reading text books and online on her own with my help. Luckily my daughter graduated with an average of 95 because she is one of those who can learn on her own without any adult teaching.', 'I completely disagree. And I have a question for you lunette, if your daughter gets straight a’s then why would she need to go to summer school? Anyway about the school, it has been amazing going to dab! The staff in its entirety is amazing the security guards are not mean at all! One time they caught me sneaking out of class and all they did was tell me to go back , no trouble! I think that you are making this wonderful school sound like a prison and I am in complete shock!', ""Linette: I shared your disappointment in his school.  I think most of the teachers that are in this school are new graduates and lack experience. In order to be good and competent teachers, you really need to find ways to intrigue and stimulate students.  The teacher needs to make students want to learn.  I find that even in some honors' classes, test questions were quite simple and lack depth.  Also, there is no need to boost up the grades by given out a 10 point bonus question.  We were just at the Science fair this month and the quality of these projects were poor and disappointing.  I have seen better projects from elementary school students.  Many of these chosen projects were not proofread and lack effort.  Most of them appeared to have put together their projects in a day or two.   Anyway, the only positive thing my daughter gained from this school is self-confidence.  Her self-esteem has been boosted because  the work load in this school is easier than her elementary school.  Students in this school are not as studious.  This school does not welcome parent participation in their children's education.  The school does not provide enough updates to parents or invitations for parents to come to school to view our child's progress.  The school website has not been updated since the current principal started, I think, with the exception of the calendar."", 'I can not believe the incompetence that you have! This school pushes their students to the limits! Take me for example, after dab I went to Brooklyn tech then to Harvard. Now I am a brain surgeon at the Indian hospital of pediatric Nuro surgery. I help save children’s lives and it was all thanks to this school!', 'People have different perspective and experiences.', ""This school is O.K. instead of particularly good or bad.  Most of the academic teachers are very nice and teach well though many are young and lack experience.  School of One is the math program the school uses which entitles the student's use of laptops to learn math with little teacher interaction.  It teaches but has many bugs that mess around with student's grades and screws up the learning experience.  I personally remember having tests with questions drastically harder than the practice the lessons gave and sometimes  being assigned lessons that were two years ahead of my grade level because I was an advanced student.  However, the honors math program is great and most of my class received high scores on the math regents. The teachers at this school definitely made the learning experience fun and memorable for the most part.  However the magnet department lacks many strong and caring teachers.  Other students have complained to me about their magnet, but I, who has never taken these courses cannot verify this as true or not.  The instrumental department has two great and hard working teachers that create a wonderful magnet experience, but I don't know much else about the other magnet teachers besides the vocal/musical theater magnet.  The vocal teacher has been shown to display favoritism among her students and often yells at them, especially nearing the time of a show date.  Nearing the time of a show date she also pulls children from classes for day rehearsals, though the number of day rehearsals she's had has been declining.  She really doesn't measure a child's talent by their ability to perform and more so by how much she likes them personally.  She acts much more like a strict director than a professional teacher.  I also wouldn't expect many special offers or awards from the school unless you as a parent like to show up to the school to complain every now and again.  The office and guidance counselor are also very nice and caring.  Overall. the school has great academics but shows many cracks in it's magnet courses."", '.................', 'Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña announced that 15 schools with existing Dual Language programs will become Model Dual Language Programs, including IS 228 David A.

Many of my college's present and former graduate students are employed at IS 228, and in my opinion, not competent to teach junior high students. Of course, this not reflect the college's ability to educate upcoming educators, because there are numerous students who have gone on to do wonderful things in the education field. Still it does not take away that IS 228 takes on prospective teachers who might have made unwise choices when it comes to their preparation in becoming educators.
