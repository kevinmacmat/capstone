27Q323,"['I graduated Scholars\' middle school in Spring of 2016. Although I left to attend Bard High School Early College Manhattan, I keep in close contact with those of my friends who stayed for the high school. In complete honesty, leaving Scholars (not staying for the high school) was the best decision I ever made going into adolescence. Yes, the school is rated high for diversity, but it handles that diversity SO poorly. Racism, sexism, anti-semitism, xeno-phobia and queerphobia is rampant, there is no concern for mental health of students, and administrators/teachers, in mine and my friends\' experience, have never done anything to deal with this. The amount of rules that restrict students from expressing themselves to the most basic extent are absurd- separate academic and gym uniforms are required, and students are asked to pay a dollar if they want to wear normal clothes on assigned ""dress-down days."" Even then, there are rules prohibiting self-expression; the Parent Handbook (accessible on www.scholarsnyc.com) states that students can be punished for wearing things considered ""disruptive"" or ""inappropriate,"" such as scarves, jewelry, any piercings, any dyed hair (even natural colors), and skirts (of no specified length). Students wearing shirts that are considered ""political,"" i.e. graphic tees with slogans of movements such as ""Black Lives Matter"" or even ""Love Wins,"" may be asked to **take their shirt off or miss class until their parents can come to school with new clothes for their child.** The Arts Department is extremely underfunded, with the theatre department only allowed $500 a semester to produce shows with complete sets, props, costumes, sound, and lighting, while the Athletics department is overfunded, receiving annual grants for new uniforms. Juuling and Vaping are also extremely popular among both high school and middle school students. In my time at Scholars, I have had person experiences with explicit anti-semitism, queerphobia, and a lack of concern for my mental instability. In reality, the social environment of Scholars\' Academy is geared towards the prosperity of cisgender-heterosexual, white kids who are good test-takers and come from supportive middle-class families. Nonetheless, if you/your child prioritizes the school\'s academic and athletic reputation over the social environment and a promotion of critical thought/self-expression/self-exploration a child may need as they edge closer to adolescence, the Scholars\' Academy may be a place where you/your child can thrive.', 'Hi what are there skedule', ""If I live in Disctrict 27, how much higher are my children's chances of being accepted into the middle school?

This appeared on the Hechinger Report,  a nonprofit, non-partisan education-news outlet affiliated with the Hechinger Institute on Education and the Media.\n\n \n\nHere‚Äôs the piece:\n\nBy The Faculty of P.S. 167\n\nImagine your first day at a new school. You are surrounded by new faces and new teachers and are navigating a new building. What are you concerned about? Making new friends? Liking your new teachers?\n\nWhen they enter our school each fall, our sixth-graders write about their hopes and fears for middle school. This year, 35 percent said their greatest fear was failing the state tests. At one of the most socially difficult times of their lives, over a third of our children have more anxiety about standardized tests than any other issue.\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nWe ‚Äî the teachers of a public secondary school in New York City ‚Äî are writing because we wish you to join us in asking this question about what‚Äôs happening in our schools. We ask you to consider our experiences and the experiences of our students in a world where schools face more standardized tests and increasing pressures related to their outcomes than ever before.\n\nThis year in our school, as in schools across the country, we have seen the number of standardized tests we are required to administer grow sharply, from 25 to more than 50 (in grades 6-10). In the next six weeks alone, each of our sixth-graders will be required to take 18 days of tests: three days of state English tests, three days of state math tests, four days of new city English and math benchmark tests, and eight days of new English, math, social studies and science city tests to evaluate teacher performance. Additionally, students who are learning English must spend two to three more days taking the NYSESLAT test for English Language Learners‚Äîa total of 21 days in just the next few weeks.\n\nConsider your own education. Yes, high-school students have always faced college entrance and graduation exams. But as elementary or middle-school students prior to No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, you likely had no more than a few days of standardized testing every spring (if that). For today‚Äôs students, however, these standardized tests have become a centerpiece of their educational experience. Time spent on these tests is time not spent on learning or teaching. The centrality of testing should be shocking, but instead is somehow accepted as commonplace.\n\nOne teacher at our school asked her seventh-graders how they felt about the tests. The word ‚Äúscared‚Äù came up multiple times, as did the word ‚Äúhate.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI feel nervous,‚Äù said one, ‚Äúbecause you think you‚Äôre not going to pass.‚Äù Another protested, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think tests show our learning, and they don‚Äôt show our growth.‚Äù A third stated, ‚ÄúIt makes it more possible to fail.‚Äù\n\nIf this seems overly dramatic, consider that in New York City, 70 percent of students are labeled ‚Äúfailing.‚Äù This is not, as many believe, a function of low performance, but a deliberate decision by the state to increase the number of students labeled ‚Äúfailing‚Äù in a move that has created more pressure on teachers and schools, and public support for new‚Äîuntested‚Äîreform initiatives. We question the collateral consequences of such a mechanism for educational change.\n\nLet us be clear at the outset: as a staff, we are not opposed to all standardized tests and believe that, used sparingly, such tests can provide useful feedback to schools, teachers and possibly students. We are instead concerned about their vast and increasing number and‚Äîjust as disconcerting‚Äîoutsized influence. The tests are no longer about feedback. The stakes attached to them now commonly include school funding and evaluation and closure, teacher pay and evaluation and firings, and of course student promotion and self-perception. It should come as no surprise that many schools have chosen to focus more and more of the school year on what is often called ‚Äútest prep.‚Äù\n\nConsider the case of two of our U.S. history teachers who sought to engage students in a case study about Fred Korematsu and the ways in which the rights of U.S. citizens have been suspended in times of war. At the last minute, worried about the impending Regents Exam, these teachers felt compelled to drop this important, in-depth investigation that would tap into student passions and diversity. Instead, they made the difficult decision to ‚Äúcover‚Äù a broad and sanitized survey of U.S. foreign policy from the Monroe Doctrine to the Cold War.\n\nAs it turns out, the thematic essay on last year‚Äôs U.S. History Regents test was on American foreign policy, and the vast majority of our students passed the test. Did we make the right decision?\n\nWhat does it mean to ‚Äútest-prep‚Äù students as a means for teaching them to read and write? It means to teach without context or commitment, without personal connection or application. It means to teach using excerpted writing passages and scripted questions. David Coleman, architect of the Common Core standards that serve as the basis for the latest tests, shared his opinion that ‚Äúas you grow up in this world you realize people really don‚Äôt give a sh*t about what you feel or what you think.‚Äù A curriculum based on standardized tests implies that our students‚Äô lives, our lives, and the vibrant lives of our communities just don‚Äôt seem to matter.\n\nIn contrast, as teachers we recognize every day that there is no true curriculum without students‚Äô lives, engagement and voices.\n\nOne of the central characteristics of our school has been that all content and skills are embedded in real-world curricula. We have a common understanding that students produce better work when they believe it is meaningful, when academic work spills into the world and back again. Our students make presentations to elementary-school students about bullying and to hospital institutional review boards about medical research proposals. They work with the Metropolitan Transit Authority on bus engine design, and with the Queens Memory Project on interviewing and preserving immigrants‚Äô stories in Queens.\n\nThey may spend weeks on a single case study, developing nuanced understandings of complex problems. In this work, they are evaluated by school-based assessments that, in contrast to standardized tests, take the shape of diverse projects and presentations. Standards, including the Common Core, are a central part of our curriculum work, but they are only one of many considerations embedded in the work our students do.\n\nAs external pressure increases to sacrifice curriculum for the sake of ‚Äútest prep,‚Äù all of us have been forced to make difficult decisions. We often hear policymakers tell us that a strong curriculum will result in strong test scores. This is simply not true. Standardized tests are, by definition, tests removed from student engagement and context; they require a particular kind of teaching that is antithetical to what most of us believe education should be. Many of us as teachers think of test prep as unprofessional and unethical. All of us believe curriculum should never begin or end with standardized tests.\n\nThis year, we took a stand on this point by subverting the evaluation of our teachers based on standardized tests. A new mandate in New York City‚Äîa direct result of Race to the Top‚Äîrequires each teacher to be evaluated by two standardized tests, most of us for at least one subject we don‚Äôt teach (the city recommended that schools evaluate their music teachers, for example, based on English and math scores). It also dramatically increased the number of tests and used tests that had never been piloted. We found this untenable.\n\nWhen the city asked us to choose two standardized tests for each teacher as part of her or his evaluation, we all agreed to assign ourselves the same tests wherever possible. For one of the tests, all of our middle-school teachers will be evaluated on the state English test for all of our students. The result: students will take the minimum number of new tests, and teachers will all receive the same score. If our students fail, all of us will fail together. In this decision, we affirm our belief that we are a teaching community that collaborates and shares curricula, not a collection of individual good or bad teachers. We will not have our entire school community bound to a barrage of tests.\n\nIt is a small but important act of resistance.\n\n \n\nSo how might all of us, as citizens with a stake in our schools, resist the narrowing of curriculum and students‚Äô lives? First, it is clear to us that our elected officials must hear from more than principals and teachers that creating new tests and tying more consequences to those tests cannot be the core of any education reform plan.\n\n \n\nSecond, some of us are also supportive of the Opt-Out movement that is growing across the country, wherein parents have creatively removed their children from standardized testing. In doing so, they refuse districts and states the data with which to evaluate students, teachers and schools based on standardized tests.\n\n \n\nSome of us are more ambivalent about this movement. But we all know that to move forward, we must do more than say no to a system in which we do not believe. We seek systems where assessments can be effective at supporting students, systems where assessments are valid, reliable and fair. Based on our experiences, we have come to believe that these systems must be built through the work of individual schools, not through large-scale standardized tests.\n\n \n\nWe suggest that policymakers begin by moving resources away from standardized test creation and toward supporting the development of quality assessments in schools. Perhaps they might create incentives for schools to design their own school-based assessments, or encourage schools to move toward performance- and project-based assessment practices shared strategically among schools (see, for example, the New York Performance Standards Consortium of schools).\n\n \n\nWe cannot emphasize enough that any school‚Äôs capacity to develop is profoundly related to the allocation of school resources. Our school invests in lower student-teacher ratios, increased hours of teacher collaboration each week, and a week of paid curriculum development before the school year begins. Each year we struggle to find this funding, and we have often fallen short of our goal.\n\n \n\nThis week, as our school enters another season of testing, our sixth- and eighth-grade teachers have chosen to read to students a principal‚Äôs letter that one parent posted online: ‚ÄúWe are concerned that these tests do not always assess all of what it is that make each of you special and unique ‚Ä¶ the scores you get will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything. There are many ways of being smart.‚Äù\n\n \n\nOur students spontaneously cheered. That they could be seen as individuals with interests and friends and dreams‚Äînot just as a set of numbers‚Äîdeeply resonated with them.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the day, we hope students see their educations not only as a means to graduate, jumpstart their careers or get into college, but as a means to investigate, interact with and innovate in a rapidly changing world. As John Dewey reminds us, ‚ÄúEducation is not preparation for life, but life itself.‚Äù We believe in a curriculum that is rich and personal‚Äîthat is, for the living. To treat curriculum and schools otherwise is to demean education, reducing it to no more than training or indoctrination in a world that needs people to be so much more.', 'Teachers band together to resist the heavy burden of standardized tests. http://hechingerreport.org/content/testing-taking-schools-teachers-one-school-explain_15431/', 'My child is on his 6th\nmonth at MELS and it‚Äôs been a great experience for us.

Elementary school teacher recommendation and grades determined 6th Grade class placement.  Teachers were great, liked teaching middle school and our child was engaged, learned a lot.    In May, right before Hunter School acceptance responses due, all 6th Graders interested in applying for 7th Grade High Honors Class were given a math test.  At Sage, that end of 6th Grade math test is ONLY factor determining entrance into 7th Grade High Honors Class. Your class grades, even if you have high 90s average in all classes and exceptional teacher recommendations, do not factor into the equation, since it is not a ""whole student"" assessment.  If you do not do well on that one math test, you it is EXTREMELY unlikely school will place you in 7th Grade High Honors Class (really, that\'s really the way it is).  We were also told that this math test is used to determine the language you study after 6th Grade, with higher math score kids being given French and lower math score kids being given Spanish.  \n\n7th Grade High Honors Class tracks through to 8th Grade High  Honors class so that if you do not gain admission into High Honors Class in 7th Grade, you can not enter High Honors Class in 8th Grade.  Advantage to being in High Honors Class is that math and science studies are accelerated to prepare to be ready in 8th Grade to take the math and science Regents that most kids typically take in 9th Grade.  Significant to note this accelerated math, science to Regents exam path is same at NEST+M, Anderson, BSGE and other G&T/Honors programs throughout city.  The High Honors Class is the only class at Sage following this curriculum, so if you are not in the High Honors Class, you will not take any Regents in 8th Grade.  Kids coming out of the High Honors Class are well prepared for High School admissions process and placement out of the High Honors Class is usually exceptional.  Note also that this year there was some difficulty with paperwork and, 3 days before exam given, current 8th Graders were told they were not allowed to take the Integrated Algebra Regents exam (and didn\'t take the exam).\n\nShould add Sage groups kids based on data so that kids end up tracked in a class by data driven assessment of ability - and stay with that class for every subject.  Means you can not be in high level for one subject and lower level for another subject (because each class attends all subjects as group and instruction intended to aim at group level).  Next year, have heard there will be two High Honors Classes, then other classes tracked below that.

This is a destination school, with many Asian parents moving to the neighborhood as renters so their kids can qualify for the Hunter Middle School. The best part about the school are the kids (well behaved, mature), some great teachers, a wonderful reading and writing curriculum, and a great math program. The kids are well prepared for the state exams, but also develop a love for reading and writing.  As long as your child is driven and smart, this is the school for her or him.

At YECA, we are a family. We care about each other academically, emotionally and socially. I am sorry to hear that Ms. Durant had an awful experience, however this goes to show that she is still on earth. There will always be some kind of discomfort even in the most comfortable places. If Ms. Durant reports that nothing was done about her bullying experience, it would be difficult to believe, especially during Ms. Burnett-Worthy's tenure as Principal. Ms. Worthy always gets to the bottom of the trouble of the students. Her main objective every day was to make the environment conducive to learning. I will not say that Ms. Durant is lying, I am just saying that because she was hurt, she decides to hurt the school. It is not fair to bash a school because you had a bad experience. What about the good experiences? Is she trying to say that she never had a good experience at YECA? What about the nurturing that the teachers gave her every day? What about the love shared by the community? YECA is a wonderful place to work and learn. The Administration and the staffs(custodial & Academic) work in tandem to provide a great learning experience every day. It is a pleasure to see how students help each other to succeed. I have worked in dog-eat-dog schools, where teachers are competing negatively with each other to see who can be the best, students competing negatively with each other to see who can get the highest GPA in order to look down on their peers, parents competing negatively with each other to see who can volunteer more time or contribute more resources to try to bribe teachers to work harder with their kids. At YECA competition is present but it is healthy. Students compete against each other but they do not put their peers down. They try to help their peers to succeed too, Parents and teachers are actively involved in competition to see how many kids they can help to succeed bu they are willing to help each other to reach their goals. YECA is a haven compared to some other places. We have achieved a lot for the short existence that we have had. We are a reward school, The school has also been recognized in the National Rankings and earned a bronze medal. Schools are ranked based on their performance on state-required tests and how well they prepare students for college.We have had a 98% graduation rate and our students are meeting and exceeding State Standards.

This school is a tight-knit community where everyone may not know the names of the people they see in the halls, but most definitely know their faces. It boils my blood that people like Julianna Durant and ""John Doe"" would come to this website\'s comment section and slander my school\'s name. I may be on my way out of high school, but I haven\'t forgotten how to read phony people and their thoughts like they\'ve been published on the front page of a newspaper. I\'m going to tell you about these shady individuals AND my school, and I GUARANTEE this is the last comment you will have to read. I\'m not like other people who won\'t respond to these negative things said about my school, because when they talk about my school, they are essentially talking about me, the students who graduated before me, AND the students in grades below me as well, and my teachers who truly care. If you are going to throw shade at my school, I WILL ECLIPSE YOU. It\'s funny how they can say all these things over the internet, and in Julianna\'s case, play victim every time they got into an altercation. I was in Julianna\'s class while she was attending this school, and I can attest that EVERY problem she had with ANYBODY in this school was a result of her unpleasant attitude and demeanor.The very way she talked to me and others around me sent off unpleasant vibes. She came from an area where that kind of attitude was accepted, and expected her ways to be accepted when she came to YECA. It was literally like she expected the world to stop when she had a problem. She claims that the administration blamed her for her ""bullying"" when she literally accosted people daily! I guess they were wrong for seeing through her BS. As for John Doe, I have no idea what GPS told him to come for my dear Principal Burnett-Worthy, BUT HE BETTER REROUTE. How dare he come sideways at her or any other administrator in my school about ""fake smiles"" FROM BEHIND A COMPUTER SCREEN?! John Doe AND Julianna ARE THE LAST, and I repeat, LAST people that you should EVER come to when having a question about MY school. Julianna was here for ONE year and left when she couldn\'t get things to go the way SHE wanted them to. She needs to save the BS for Bank of America because it will buy her NOTHING here. And don\'t believe her when she says she didn\'t intend to bash my school. If her experience was that bad, she wouldn\'t even be thinking of searching YECA up to leave her unimportant thoughts in the comment section. And yes, I said UNIMPORTANT. My classmates can tell you that she is only to be forgotten like forget-me-nots. AND John Doe? First of all, it\'s common sense to NEVER take advice from anyone who can\'t post their own name in a COMMENT Section, let alone someone whose only experience with YECA seems to be from him sitting down and watching the 24 hour news channel which is likely the only channel he has beside PBS. I mean, HE CAN\'T EVEN SPELL ""principal"" or ""jeopardy"" RIGHT! I have been at this school since, September of 2009, and I will be supporting my high school, which is practically where I\'ve spent almost half of my life up to this point, long after I graduate this June. So, if you have any concerns about sending your child here, YOU TAKE IT FROM ME. My teachers were always dedicated and they cared about EACH and EVERY one of us. Due to my school\'s teachings, I was able to score a 1970 out of 2400 on my SAT on the first try, and one of my classmates bested me with a 2040 on his SAT on his second try. For Christ sakes, we\'ve had students that graduated from here get accepted into IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS such as Princeton! Let Julianna and John say what they want, but frankly, I don\'t care. As I said before, I\'ve been here from the jump in 6th Grade, and I will continue to support my school long after I graduate in June. Take it from me, this school is more than great, and so is it\'s staff. If John Doe wants to come back and talk his trash about a school he\'s never been to, I WILL be waiting. That goes, for Ms. Durrant as well.', ""YECA is a great program school. There is too much politics there, and the principle is all about her self. In the NY1 video she simply did not let the young man who was published in the papers get his time to shine, It was all about her and making her look good. There is a lot of politics at that school.

It\'s very unfortunate that you believed that I asked for it, your words ""simply because you asked for it"".  No one asks to be bullied and it\'s attitudes like yours that cause thousands of teenagers to commit suicide each year.  Bullying is a serious offense and should never be taken lightly.

My education is and has always been my number one priority.  My intention, Mekai Twix Ruddock, is not to bash your school but to share my experience and another perspective.  I believe that most of the posts portrayed YECA as perfect and that is very misleading!  Sure the early college programs are a great way to save money, advance your education and get a head start in college, that\'s the reason my mom had me attended there in the first place.  However, there is much room for improvement where the culture of the school is concern.

I have taught at schools where students fight or cut and watched people look the other way. YECA is NOT that type of school at all.  Daily attendance is mandatory for all class periods and when students are out the attendance personnel is contacted immediately.  One may think that because of the location of the school that violence is a problem, but it‚Äôs not at all!  Our students are scholars! Students compete with each other to achieve high grades, hold positions of leadership within school clubs, and complete their community service requirements. We are a small learning community of dedicated students, faculty, staff and administration.  You know you‚Äôre in a great school when several staff member send their own children to the school, collaborate during their time off, and maintain strong relationships with students‚Äô families.  There is constant communication between parents, teachers, students, and in some cases tutors that support students as well. The one thing I must say though is if you want to succeed there as a student or member of the faculty, then you must be consistent and have a strong work ethic. There is a clear vision stressed upon by the Administration Team made up of Ms. Worthy and Mr. Angeles that all students can not only graduate high school and attend college, but that all students attending YECA have an open gateway to master their course work during High School to adequately prepare them for their college courses.  Our students not only graduate with advance regents diplomas, and college credits that in most cases are in excess of 60 credits, but our students graduate knowing that they are forever a part of a network whose main objective is to support their academic and career goals.\n\nWE ARE YECA!

With the assistance of dedicated professional teachers and staff you have all the requirements needed to succeed as long as you are willing to put in the work. For the past 2 years I have continuously received letters from colleges expressing their interest in me based on my academic achievements at YECA.

The premise is a supportive atmosphere for girls, that otherwise they may not get in an co-ed setting. However, as the child transitions from middle school to high school this is where the school does not live up to its merits. There is no concrete plan to tackle bullying, and as a result this school year there has been many fights. I am unsure as to why they have been so many physical altercations but it would seem the school does not either. Last school year as a parent I was very upset to learn that my daughter was allowed to watch a movie in her classroom as part of the lesson they were doing that week. However, the teacher carelessly allowed an inappropriate scene to be showed that show a man and a women engaging in cardinal behavior. I found out about this now through the school or the teacher but by my daughter it seems that she was looking for the movie on her Netflix account as I heard her friends discussing it. I understand mistakes do happen but being that this school has such a ""high reputation"" I\'m beginning to wonder what else is going on that parents do not know about. Another situation that caused me to scratch my head is dismay is when another school employee allowed a student to help sort report cards. The students being privy to this information started bullying another student about her poor grades. Another concerned parent told me about this and once again I was in shock. I can only report on the experiences that I have had in this school. If I had a choice I would have had my daughter transfer to another school, but the Board of Education has strict rules about transfers.

I have to say as a current middle school student there is a lot of drama but you can't escape it at any school you'll always be with petty girls you just got to know when to stay out of it cause then you'll be at fault also. The school doesn't offer many clubs but what they do offer I guarantee your child will have fun. They have a rock band where you can learn to play instruments. You have cheerleading and more. We have a brother school also known as Eagle Academy which is an all boys school on Merrick Blvd that we have many events with such as dances and prom. I can admit that you make some really good friends with eagle sometimes many of use become more than friends. You have many opportunities for you daughter but you always got to work for them because they don't get handed to you.

They\'re extremely rude, mean, and sly. My daughter came home many days, crying, and whenever we went to complain about this to the dean or guidance counselor, they didn\'t help at all, even though each and every time the other person was clearly the attacker. Why? Because my daughter wasn\'t of the race this school favors.\n\nThe dean is absolutely useless. My daughter told me about how she saw students fighting, pulling each other\'s hair, rolling on the ground, throwing food, and ruining each other\'s properties countless days during lunch. The dean doesn\'t notice any of this, and went on to punish these friends who were playfully slapping each other.\n\nThere was even a period of months where the school had assigned seating for lunch. That is absurd. There\'s students who have bad vibes towards each other, and they were told to sit next to each other. The students got assigned seats, because the grades that had lunch prior left trash and food all around the cafeteria, and certain tables in my daughter\'s lunch period were full of dirty people who didn\'t bother to take care of their own trash, and that is why people who\'re always doing their duty had to be punished as well as the ones at fault. They said this was to build teamwork. I don\'t know how such a bad school could build teamwork with such bad methods. Worst of all, my daughter asked a lowerclassman if they had assigned seats for lunch, and they didn\'t. Guess what? They were students from the lunch period prior my daughter\'s; the ones who made the cafeteria dirty originally.\n\nThe guidance counselor never helps resolve problems. She instigates them.\n\nThe staff don\'t even know about their own school. I asked the school\'s parent coordinator about my aris parentlink password which I forgot, and she said she doesn\'t know what that is, and how to do that.\n\nIt makes my daughter miserable every day. They first thing she says after coming home each day is ""Mother, I don\'t want to go to school tomorrow."" I know it isn\'t a joke, because she\'s not one to complain about things unless they really, really pain her.\n\nThe old principal most likely got demoted from a principal in TYWLS to a dean in another, because her title as principal was nothing. Every time she made an announcement, it was barely audible. She favored students for their race, and invited them to eat lunch with her. \n\nThe new principal doesn\'t do much either.\n\nThe school is miniscule. Every time my daughter changes classes, there are horrible traffic jams on the stairs where the ruder and students of larger mass trample over the ones saying excuse me, and make them late for class.\n\nThe French teacher is oblivious to this, and disgustingly scolds students who tried, and got trampled in the stairs coming from the basement to the third floor and were seconds late. The students who can\'t see from the back aren\'t given a seat in the front in her classroom as well.\n\nThe school is tardy with things.\n\nWhen my daughter entered high school, she wasn\'t even invited to the orientation. She couldn\'t get her uniform, and was scolded for it, even though the school was at fault.\n\nThe students received their official schedules late. There were four switches in the schedule. The students had to come over and over to the school during their precious vacation to get schedules that weren\'t even official. Even on the first day of school, there were schedule issues. It\'s been more than a week since school started, and many students still have incorrect schedules.\n\nLast year, the official honors class started two months late because the school was too stupid to sort itself out, and made the new honors students miss two months of precious Regent\'s preparation. My daughter\'s friend, who\'s a grade below her, got low nineties for her math and earth science regents, when she could\'ve gotten a 100.\n\nThe school also doesn\'t offer English honors classes, unlike the other schools in New York.\n\nThe supplies in this school are barbaric. There are no smartboards that function, while in other schools, whiteboards and chalkboards have become ancient things after the introduction of the smartboard. The school didn\'t get any textbooks for many of the classes at all last year. My daughter had to pass her exams with only her personal notes, which luckily, are very good, if I do say so myself.\n\nThe teachers seem to be rookies. They treat the talented students like they\'re the only people who exist in the classroom, and don\'t even try to make the less gifted students any smarter. They forget things often, and take absences like it\'s nothing. They also pair up the smarter students with the not-so-smart and not-so-effort-giving students, and in the end, that one smart kid in the group ends up doing all the work for her group of 5 imbeciles, and we all know group projects aren\'t small things.\n\nMany teachers keep quitting over the years, and the new ones are usually just as bad. The phys ed teachers barely let the students move around in the school\'s tiny gym. (Oh, did I mention that this school has no auditorium, so the dances, graduation ceremonies, and some of the morning meetings are held in the gym? The others are held in the cafeteria or library.) Last year, the students with gym took their phys ed classes in the cafeteria and library. Doesn\'t this come off as absurd to you?\n\nThis school has barely any AP courses, and they\'re only available in 11th grade. This makes the students of this school inferior to the students who have AP\'s in 9th and 10th grade. There are also barely any clubs, so the students aren\'t given many fun opportunities. Barely any trips as well. \n\nThere are many other problems in this school. I\'m currently regretting not letting my daughter attend the other schools she got accepted to because I preferred same sex education. I\'m trying my best to help her transfer out of this hell of a school, and if you parents who have daughters attending and feel the same as me about this school, transfer your daughters quickly before they lose a chance to get into those Ivy Leagues we wanted them to attend since birth.', ""There will be situations in every school where children are bullied or act in a certain way.

29Q270,"['This school needs new leadership.  It is fine that the principal Chayvonne Harper and her two assistant principals are nice, and give off the appearance of efficiency and effectiveness.  In actually, it has not been proved to come to fruition.  My children attended this school from K-8, having the experience of both the previous principal Ms. Andrews, and the changes under Ms. Harper.  We have also experienced the same under the previous assistant principals and the new.  When your staff ""flees"" -- leaves in exodus -- that is a sign.  When some of your staff live in the area and are familiar with the community, the kids, etc. - that is also great -- but don\'t send their children to this school -- that is also a sign. (Maybe they don\'t want to be with their children all day; but, if this was a truly ""great"" school, they\'d have them their with no problem.)  The biggest issues with the administration is lack there of.  There is very little follow-up and follow through.  When one child was ""moving up"" to 6th grade, the assistant principal sent a notice home requesting that all children show up in their Sunday best.  She showed up in ripped jeans and a t-shirt.  \n\nLet\'s talk academics.  In relation to many schools across NYC, you have teachers who are their to teach and lead, and others their for the paycheck, the summer off, and the knowledge they can\'t be fired. That is evident in the lack of challenging work presented in many of the subjects.  Many people posted about a particular math teacher -- that teach remains inadequate, inefficient and ill-equipped.  She also remains a teacher in this school.  Also in relation to many schools across NYC, you will have students who shine! They are innately curious, and thereby studious and they excel and would excel no matter their circumstance or surrounding.  For the rest of the students who require focused, broken-down, explicitly explained curriculums, that will be a challenge to locate here.  The teachers appear to be on a scheduled agenda to get in a specified amount of work in a specified amount of time.  If your child is not picking up those lessons within that time-frame, they will be left behind, because the class must move on. With regard to the mention of the music teacher as mentioned below -- my children learned the recorder for 4 years - a purchase the parent has to make.  There are very few if any other instruments.  My children never returned home with an art project. \n\nLet\'s talk physical space.  The building is approximately 10-15 years old - and yet last required a completely new roof.  The gym is built for kids no older than 6th grade, yet the space is occupied with 8th graders (experiencing growth sprouts and body development).  The space was not built with middle schoolers in mind, and has not been adapted for such.  (There was a child who had to be sawed out of a desk, lawsuit pending).  There are no lockers in the school - so children must carry every book they own, and wear their coats all day through out the weather appropriate months. Retro-fitting of lockers, at least for the 60 or so kids in middle school is physically possible, but questionable if fiscally possible. \n\nI used INSIDE SCHOOLS to help locate a school for my children to transfer to.

Anyways for parents or children please read this because I like this school but if you want your child to get the best education aim for something higher.', ""As a former Teacher at IS 10, I can only share positive things, specifically:\n\nParents - Your child will receive a solid education from a fine institution which has a hardworking, dedicated, friendly and talented staff.  Your child will become part of a community of learners that are deeply cared for and loved.  They will be very, very safe and enjoy their middle school experience.  You will never regret sending your child to this school.  \n\nFuture Teachers - If you are lucky enough to get selected to join this amazing group of educators, you won't regret it.  I can honestly say that this staff is like family and I miss them dearly.  Due to child care/transportation issues, I needed to change schools, otherwise I would have never left.  I was there 4 years, and it was wonderful.  The tone and vibe are 100% upbeat and people are genuinely nice and willing to help you.   Teachers support other Teachers and every staff member is treated with respect.  \n\nAdministration - Principal Lopes is a class act!  He runs the school with a deep concern and passion for the children.  He respects you as a professional and allows you to have a personal life.  He does not micro-manage and empowers you to grow in your profession.  He values the staff and is 100% trustworthy and fair.  He listens to you and supports you.  You aren't going to get better than Mr. Lopes.  He's the kind of boss that you want to make happy and earn his respect.  \n\nI was lucky enough to report into Assistant Principal Altan.  There aren't enough words to describe how appreciative I am for all that she did for me.  I was the School Librarian and any time I asked for supplies or needed anything for the library she always said yes.  100% of the time.  She's kind, fair and a great listener.  I was empowered to grow in my profession and given the flexibility to improve my craft and incorporate my vision for the library.  She's a person of her word and highly trustworthy.  \n\nBottomline, if your child attends this school or you're lucky enough to get a job, it will be a worthwhile experience that you won't ever regret.  A happy staff equates to a positive learning experience which enhances the student's lives.

30Q141,"['Best time of my school life was here. I however went when it was still referred to as JHS 141 and it was from 7th to 9th grade. Many years ago.

We are lucky to live nearby the school and he got in 6th grade in Honors program because of his good test results in 4th grade. The thing is in Honors program you have to keep at least 80% of all major subject (Ela, Math, SS and Science), otherwise in mid October they will move children around in and out Honors (that happened in the 6th grade).\nIn mid October of our 7th grade they terminated a class and moved all students to different classes (this can be frustrating to an adjusting child).\nOther than that I have had meetings with the office people, dean, pr. assistant and all were very helpful with information and advice to my concerns. I signed for emails and i was effectively informed each week of anything happening in the school. On top of that in 6th grade i demanded a DAILY report from all my child teachers of his perform in the class.. it was really helpful!!\nThe school is quite big and lots of kids go there, really a diverse culture. The school has several teachers each subject to keep up with student load. \nThey separate 6, 7 and 8 graders coming in and out different entrances and having their own floors, lunch times, so practically they never meet. I heard during school hours the inside halls are extremely quiet, even when pupils move from one room to another they are aligned in column and in order, walk quietly and in general i never heard no one had any (safety) problem in that school. Lunch time - they have assigned seats, so the downfall is the children cant actively interact with each other, not until the end of the school day. \nIn the end i am very happy with this school, living in such an expensive part of Queens, I am glad at least the education part of our life counts.', ""My child just graduated from this school.  He had a wonderful academic experience the entire 3 years. He was in the honors class. The teachers challenged them to be the best they could be. There were times that the work could be overwhelming with the projects and tests but that's because Ms. Pavlou just want her students to be prepared for high school. The only thing I wish this school would improve on is the music program. My child was very lucky to have Mr.Arnold as his band teacher  for 2 years.

Liked all of my teachers here in the 3 years I attended, many good ones that inspired me to learn. After this school i went to a [certain] specialized high school and didn\'t find it that hard to maintain a 95~ average there, of course, with effort applied. But I think if you manage to get into the top classes, (6H1, E1, S1, and their ""2 or 3"" counterparts) you\'ll be very well off. \n\nDownside is if you\'re not in the top classes, this is still a great school, just slightly less so. Also i don\'t really believe that the top class student selection is exactly fair. If you\'re in 6H1, almost definitely 3/4 of the class will go to exclusively E1 or S1 and the other 1/4 go to other ""1"" in the other academy the 3/4 didn\'t go to.Usually none fall out of the 1\'s. \n\nAfter this, other kids from lower honors grades [or if they\'re really good from regular classes] get placed into 7E1 or 7S1. Thing is, after 7th grade, the 8th grade class is generally the same, even if a (E/S)1 gets like a 83ish average. Few new people get in honor classes after 7th grade, since few get removed, the process is very lazy. To get the most out of this school, work hard in 5th grade and 6th grade(maybe) so you land in the top classes.\n\nOverall it\'s a good school 98/100', 'IS 141 has won special funding for technology upgrades through Councilman Costa Constantinides\' participatory budget process.
