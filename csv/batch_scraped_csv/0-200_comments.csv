01M015,P.S. 15 Parent,manhattan,Elementary,161,"P.S. 15 is an extraordinary small school that goes to extraordinary lengths to engage and care for their children. The principal, Irene Sanchez, leads an incredible group of attentive teachers and administrators who are dedicated to providing a safe, caring, and exciting environment for children to learn. The G&T program is enrichment based (not ""accelerated"") and has re-instilled a sheer joy of learning in our child, which is a priority for us as a family. Of the many enrichments, the kids have a dedicated STEAM teacher, dedicated Science teacher, special interest classes that the children choose every Friday, a wonderful music class, and 2nd graders attend swimming once a week at Asphalt Green. There are also many field trips and hands on, project-based learning opportunities. The children have an amazing playground attached to the school and are allowed to play outside before and after school and during recess. They also have a great gym and have gym class three times a week. The small class sizes (our son currently has 16 children in his G&T class) is another amazing thing about this school and something that is hard to find in the NYC public school system. Another aspect I appreciate so much at PS15 is how open the lines of communication are. The teachers, staff and principal always make time to address any concerns. There is also a parent coordinator, Lanette Murphy (Ms. Mia), who will literally move mountains to address any issues you or your child might be having, whether they be logistical or more complex in nature. Most importantly, this is a school that puts an enormous amount of effort into teaching social emotional skills and into supporting their community of parents and children. They teach, by example, what it means to be curious, kind, generous, patient, tolerant and supportive. We have learned so much from P.S. 15 and feel privileged to be a part of such a special school.",0,0,0,2020-05-11T14:13:41,1.0,0.05,0.23,0.006,0.889,0.39799999999999996,0.77,0.124,0.28,0.5529999999999999,0.037000000000000005,0.22699999999999998

I have one child in the dual language program and have seen her confidence and passion for learning language really evolve. What an incredible value for her to be academically fluent in another language!

01M020,HS Mann,manhattan,Elementary,439,"My son attends Pre-K at Anna Silver and we have registered for the 
Dual Language Kindergarten program next year. We have had an excellent experience at the school. 

 Anna Silver is welcoming,friendly, orderly, and energetic. My son's teacher, Mrs. Torres, is exceptional. She has 13+ years experience and 4 children of her own, and it shows. She is calm, cool, and collected when managing the classroom and also warm and attentive to the individual needs of each student. My husband and I are consistently impressed with her professionalism and efficiency. She has provided thoughtful feedback at each of our son's reviews and has identified key strategies to optimize his growth and development. I am so appreciative of the individual attention she provides.  

The class sizes at Anna Silver are smaller than the city-wide average. Our son's class has 18 students and, in addition to his teacher, a full-time assistant teacher.  Mrs. Zakaria is a constant ray of sunshine and I am so thankful for her presence.  

Anna Silver's facilities are impressive. The school has a large playground,  gymnasium, cafeteria, and auditorium.  There is dedicated time for recess each day and plenty of space where the children can move.  There are well maintained learning centers in each classroom and opportunities for child centered learning and play.  (Pre-K students are also taught more traditional reading fundamentals, the alphabet, and  numbers.)

I echo the praise given to the school's administration by previous commenters.  Principal James Lee, Assistant Principal Jen Chase, and Parent Coordinator Tracey Arrington were a significant factor in my choosing Anna Silver.  They set the tone for the school.  Their earnest, accessible, and up-beat energy are present in all of the interactions I've had at the school.  They have cultivated a wonderful culture at the Anna Silver school that is evident even in the friendly manner in which the security guards first greet you.  Everyone seems to enjoy being there.

Another notable strength of PS 20 is the abundance of outside programs and community partnerships.  This year we have benefited directly from PS 20's affiliation with Turtle Bay Music and Wellness in the Schools. I look forward to my son enjoying the other many opportunities available to upper grades in the coming years.

Tracey Arrington is the most competent and friendly of the parent coordinators I met at the five schools we toured. The principal, James Lee is a role model, a leader, and really gets involved on so many levels. At his side is Jen Chase, the assistant principal. We loved the Pre-K set-up from breakfast in the morning to all the special music, arts, and cooking classes. My son has just started the dual language Kindergarten which is very exciting. I was scared off at first by the size of the school but when you walk the halls it feels so friendly and I know so many of the administrators and teachers within the first year that it feels like a small community. The top most important thing is that my son loves it, he is literally grinning ear to ear each day. Not to mention how impressed I am with how this enthusiasm translates to his learning.

My son
started duel language Kindergartner at P.S 20, my son was a canadate for   gifted and talented, we opted for the duel
language program instead, in Kindergarten James Lee, the principle stated the
kids will learn through play, I am all for learning through play constructive
play.  In first grade we had a wonderful
English teacher and a horrible first year duel language Chinese teacher.  Now is second grade, the  English teacher is the worst, no personality
yells at the kids and very cold. My child complains about not wanting to go to
school because the teachers are not nice. 
There are 22 kids in one class and I believe 24 kids in the other duel
language class. I am being told my child is not focusing and is having a hard
time staying on task.  This is a
7-year-old boy playful, highly intelligent. speaks well and is able to
articulate himself well. I don’t know what is going on. I sat with the teacher
and the principle to come up with a plan for my child to succeed. I was told  to do journaling with my son, this is going to
help.

 

 

Ps. 20 is a
high poverty school, so all kids are lumped in together.  They treat everyone as if we are on welfare.

I went straight to the school to inquire about applying,,, the district office was dragging their feet when it came to placement for my daughter once we knew RGA was closing,,,,the one difference was the dress code...its pretty liberal there is no uniform...kids are expressive, and its cute to see....

PS 20 is a nice place to be -  From staff, to teachers, there is some bullying i hear from my daughter and from other parents, and I plan on putting my child in a self defense class so that she builds a bit more confidence in herself in terms of handling things,,,,also over-all my daughter's teachers are very good with her, are caring and i purposefully asked for placement in a CTT class so that my daughter gets the attention she needs with more staff in the room. I am just eager to find out when the results of the state tests are coming in...overall,,,i'm glad this school doesnt share with any other schools, every time i go to the school, its a happy place, the principal is hands on and present, i see him every time i go to the school,,he is active, Tracey the parent education coordinator is always ready to say good morning, and hello, invite parents to a workshop, I hope they continue to keep the classes small, and that James Lee does not leave,,,the staff is solid,,,the one critique i have to honestly say is that the afterschool options are a bit frustrating,,,luckily i found one that is (paying) convenient in terms of picking her up and keeping her until 6pm every day...the one inside the school is monopolized by families that are Chinese and i don't say this in a mean way, its just the way it is sadly....overall the year has gone pretty smoothly....for any parents considering PS 20 just continue to do your research and have your eyes peeled...",3,0,0,2012-05-25T18:17:59,0.75,0.14400000000000002,0.264,0.09300000000000001,0.772,0.16399999999999998,0.647,0.289,0.13,0.506,0.036000000000000004,0.29600000000000004

I won't mention the teacher's name that I worked with, because she does not teach for recognition, but I she was a prime example of what the school was all about. PS 20 is quite possibly the most family oriented elementary school that I've ever had the opportunity to be associated with in any capacity (volunteering, teaching, attending). By family oriented, I am referring to the way in which each and every student at the school seemingly understands that they are a part of a greater program, and they all work to make it function as best as possible. As in every school there are one or two ""knuckleheads,"" but they are few, and do not detract from everything positive about the school. I had the opportunity to work with about 30 students, and got to know at least 10 more. I have never worked with students that were as willing and anxious to learn as the students of PS 20. I am an education major at Brown, and the very first thing I learned is at school was that students will rise to the level of expectation. Students at PS 20 are not only held to high expectations by the faculty and staff, but they make the statement true. In fact, many times, you might find students holding other students accountable to this high level of expectation. I could go on and on about the school, but I think I have made my point.

I am a parent and a teacher at PSMS34 and the
word family comes to mind when I think of my journey through the years. My
colleagues and I have chosen to send our children at the school we teach
because of the how our staff supports the needs of our students. Our principal
and her team put our children’s safety and academic needs at the forefront of
every decision that is being made with the input of our teachers. Our principal
begins and ends every discussion with an emphasis on how to support the WHOLE
child. We struggle like every school and we continue to grow with the support
of our administrative team's data dives, discussion of trends, and which
research based best practices could be used to ensure that every child has
equitable access towards mastery. They have provided teachers with evidenced
based curriculum to help us enhance our learning environment with modern
learning strategies that instill lifelong learning through the use of real
world problem-solving and decision-making tasks. Our leadership has brought
about change in our building to foster best instructional practices that
optimizes discovery and exploration. Surely, we are still growing and we have
miles to go before we rest. However, we keep our students at the heart of all
we do which is why our student thrive and we believe that all our students are
making academic gains which cannot be solely measured with a test. Our students
are more than a test score in our eyes each and every one of our learners has a
voice and a talent that needs to shine!",0,0,0,2018-10-05T22:49:53,0.75,0.076,0.392,0.027999999999999997,0.9490000000000001,0.295,0.875,0.027999999999999997,0.33,0.601,0.027999999999999997,0.455

is a unique individual whose needs is ""not one size fits all"" approach. As a result, they have chosen to move on whether it be closer to home and family or simply to another school. So to them we say ""goodbye"" and open our doors to others who are willing to teach our children the values and ethics of what it means to be responsive to change and to accept all for
who they are and not for what they would like them to be. Our administrative team has unlocked teacher leadership pathways with their many years of being educators as well as their knowledge of the current trends in best practices. As for favoritism to a select few, I would like to say that authentic hard work and collaboration is valued! Does that sound like favoritism or simply the recognition of people who understand that we are held accountable to educating children?

01M034,bruised and battered,manhattan,K-8,288,"I would never recommend this school to a parent searching for a school for their child or a teacher looking for a job. There is a reason that the enrollment at PS 34 is pitifully low, with enrollment decreasing every year.  As a teacher, it is nearly impossible to do the job of teaching because every day is a battle of wills with a gang of disruptive students in each class who do not come to school ready to learn. For the ones who do want to learn, they are robbed of their opportunity to learn on a daily basis. Parents, as a whole, are uninvolved and disinterested in the educational process and the school administrators do not support teachers in matters of discipline, leaving them to deal with disruptions all day, every day. Although many of the students are curios and bright, the children learn little and the state test scores don't lie! The principal (who has but a few years of actual teaching experience) blames teachers for low scores, harasses the ones she doesn't like, and rewards her few favorites with high scores on observations and plum positions out of the classroom and AWAY from kids! 40% of the teachers left this year...wonder why.

01M034,A Voice ,manhattan,K-8,288,"I agree with this statement. Particularly, the culture of blame part. Principal Angeliki Loukatos rarely gives support to her teachers, both professionally and emotionally, and is not clear with communicating. She is not a present leader and stays in her office majority of the time. She is almost never seen by the students or the staff. The only time she visits classrooms is when she is required to do observations. She is not familiar with her students, her staff or what's going on in her school. Things are unavoidably going to go wrong when there is no guidance, support, or clear expectations. When something does goes wrong, she blames her teachers. Instead of changing, she stays exactly the same; in her office and away from us. At the same time, she blames others for the shortcomings of HER school. No school can thrive with weak leadership. Neither the principal nor the assistant principal is reflective. They refuse to accept responsibility for their inept leadership skills.

""I agree with the father who said that the Principal seems to focus so much on test scores that there's little time and focus on encouraging children's imaginations. Learning the basics are important, but there has to be some effort towards encouraging and motivating children to seek ways and learning tools outside of the classroom. There are no after-school activities except for tutoring for those children with low-test scores. The music teacher is amazing, but is so intent on making the music program work, that many children complain that there's no enjoying what they learn. My daughter had two absolutely wonderful and dedicated teachers in 5th and 6th grades. They responded to all my concerns and questions and kept in touch throughout the school year and summer. The principal, however, is very hard to reach and is not seen often interacting the students. The parent-teacher coordinator is responsive, very helpful. Also, because the school has students from Kindergarten through 8th grade, they need to keep a better watch on the older students' interactions with the younger ones. This past year my daughter's class was pen pals with older students from a school in the Bronx - they should've thought about doing something along those lines with the students in the school - perhaps pairing an 8th grade class with a 6th grade class and 7th grade class with 5th grade and so on. Actually all schools should create such programs. Overall, I am please with the school and hope it continues to improve.""",2,0,0,2005-09-09T15:41:05,0.75,0.076,0.392,0.027999999999999997,0.9490000000000001,0.295,0.875,0.027999999999999997,0.33,0.601,0.027999999999999997,0.455

years of private school, public school, Elementary, Middle and High 
School, rural and urban schools, I had a lot of knowledge about 
schooling from the inside, but was really nervous about choosing a 
school for my (then) three year old.

Initially 
looking for schools closer to home in Brooklyn, I olny discovered PS63 
with the help of a DOE Staffer. It was our top choice for the second 
round of Pre-K admissions and it was like hitting the 
jackpot! I could see when we came in to register that the staff was 
warm, astute and child-centered--incredible foreshadowing for the year 
to 
come.


In addition to welcoming us all the staff 
showed tremendous 
care and affirmation and appropriately challenged and guided my 
daughter. Her teacher quickly and easily read and understood my child; 
her communication 
with families was respectful, timely and concise; her teaching 
partnership with was a lovely balance and our conferences were fruitful,
 direct, realistic and 
practical.



Outside of her primary 
classroom, my daughter benefited from and still talks about classes from
 last year with her other teachers--PE, Music, Art, and Library (our 
second home)--who made 
fantastic recommendations to engage her, helped her to find joy, 
confidence and 
curiosity in creation and movement and gave her concrete tools for 
collaboration.

The teachers are amazing, and very dedicated to the students. They do not teach for state tests instead they prepare the students for critical thinking. There are no text books, which I like since they create their own curriculum and are not limited to teach according to one textbook. In Math and ELA, students are broken out in groups based on their ability across the grades, but have specific focus to help them grow and develop.  The classes have two teachers and then one or two assistant teachers.  They are available to answer questions. And ClassDojo (a facebook for schools) is a great tool for teachers, parents, and staff to stay connected.  Teachers post videos with new math concepts to help parents understand (!!!!).

The way they realized when I needed help was just by looking at my actions, they would see a change in my behavior and they automatically knew something was wrong because, they knew me so well as an individual and my personality. And it wasn't one person who knew me well. It was every teacher there was in the building. I have decided to share my opinion publicly because after this year I will be attending high school.

 daughter since she entered the school in kindergarten. She is now in 
3rd grade and still loves the school as well as the staff. Granted the 
school in not perfect but what school is? But the staff goes above and 
beyond to make sure that us parents are well informed of everything that goes on with our children. Ms. Alice the parent coordinator has always been awesome and amazing to everyone. As parents we have to take responsibility for our children and their actions. We know our children better than anyone else, so Im sure we recognize what our children can bring to each environment, good and bad. Accidents happen ALL THE TIME for children, even with supervision present. When our children are hurt at home or we as parents make mistakes, do you immediately label our self as a bad parent? Of course not somethings just happen and with children things always 
happen.
 My daughter is extremely sensitize so I am extremely over protective with my her so I'm looking at all aspects of the school and I have no complaints. And whenever I have any issues they are addressed then handled by whoever I bring the issue to. Yes, she has been in the nurses office for minor injuries, yes she has cried because of something someone said but its always handled before the issue is brought to me. What stands out is when we walk in the building and all the staff address my daughter by name, the staff address me by first name, my daughter comes home sharing happy stories very often, she's eager to get to school to participate in school activities and explains why she loves the people that surround her. You are a parent and you feel things need to change? Ok, I'm sure there maybe tons of parents with concerns and that's what the PTA is for. Join and help make a difference in our school. The hours are flexible enough to meet the needs of working parents as well. Why not work as a TEAM to make the school better for our children instead of criticizing the ones that are a major part of our children's life?

I have been disappointed to see how little the parents are involved with the school and ensuring that it is a great place for your child to learn and grow.  I have a feeling that all of the parents who have complained below have never given an ounce of their time to make the school a better place, which is sad.  

PS 63 has a small student body, giving every child ample opportunity to have lots of individualized attention.  Moreover I find the staff to be incredibly dedicated to their craft and to each and every child.  If children are failing at this school it's because they're are not getting the support they need at home, not because the teachers aren't trying their hardest.

The extra-curricular teachers for art, music, gym and dance class are all incredible and Ms. Alice is a cornerstone of this institution.  In truth, I don't know much about the principle, I'm not wowed by her, but I feel at most schools the principals really aren't the one's who know what's going on, it's either the asst. principle or someone of that caliber underneath them.

She will try to help parents out as much as possible WITHIN reason. No principal can agree to accommodate every single parental request--that is just insane!

Arent the teachers running extended day? After school cannot take every single enrolled child. they dont have the staff or funding. And how many principals greet the students coming into school everyday??? Not man. And 63 is one of the only schools in district one NOT to fall behind. They are a B school.

The principal expects teachers to maintain a high level of academic rigor in our classrooms, and we are given ample professional development to improve our teaching practice. Parents might not be aware of how much learning the teachers are engaged in at P.S. 63, but their children are reaping the benefits. Having a small staff encourages collaboration and allows teachers take on leadership roles that enrich the school community outside of our own classrooms. For example, in response to parent feedback seeking a program for high-performing students who need some extra challenges, the principal has supported me in developing an enrichment program in Philosophy for advanced students in grades 3-5.

01M064,Concerned Parent,manhattan,Elementary,204,"I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask parents to  not be in the classroom in the morning after 8am. Some of these parents stroll in with their children after 8 and linger in the classroom. Teaching has to start at 8am, and parents lingering around are a distraction. For grades 3 to 5 in particular, it is crucial for the class to get through as miuch of the lessons during the day, because of the upcoming state tests. Some of the parents who complain about this policy are not thinking of what's best for their child's learning, and like to think that they can do whatever they want in the school premises. They even congregate in front of the school to bad mouth the prinicipal and what he has been doing to improve academic performance. How twisted is that? Some people have too much time on their hands and instead of supporting the school, they thrive on drama and gossip and do nothing to help build a stronger PTA.

When my oldest son came to this school he was held back because his previous school was a joke. he went from being held back and barely reading to the accelerated class. I was always impressed with the teachers level of skill. I had never felt out of place I always felt welcomed. Ms. Quvus was an excellent principal, she was always respectful she always displayed a kind manner and was always dressed appropriately for the school environment.
There is no exaggeration, things have changed and not for good. I hear complaints from all parents however The concern should be for all students General Ed, students with IEP's and G&T. Every child deserves to have a quality education. The same level of concern should be geared toward all of the students but unfortunately there is a biased there is a group for change but only for their group. That's why being involved is discouraging to many, not because they do not want to be involved but mostly because it becomes more about ""my group"" and not about all. Everyone may not have the same level of education, abilities, or financing but everyone does have the same concern and that is at least I hope it is that ALL children have access to the same Quality Education.
The new principal has definitely added to the tension filled environment. To be a good leader you first have to learn to follow. From day one she chose to do her own thing. I still don't know what that is. All I see is a lot of negativity. I see how things have changed and I'm still in awe I can't believe what has happened to this school.

The poor grade the school received has a lot more to do with the strained relationship between the principal and her staff. The teachers panned Karen in their ratings because of her adversarial leadership style and underlying tensions she caused. 

You also have to bear in mind that there is a very wide disparity between the G&T students and the special needs students in the CTT classes who may have IEP's and may bring down the school's overall test scores. 

For a gifted student, 110 is hands-down a better choice than MCS. It is a safe school with an active parent and PTA community and a rising population of more affluent parents who are effecting more fund-raising toward programs that benefit all students at the school.

Let me be very clear, a school does not receive poor grades b/c of a principal's popularity.  It takes more than negative opinions from disgruntled teachers to give a school a bad grade.  If you want to know what goes into a school grade you should look at the DOE website.  

I have two children in the school, one of which is actually graduating this year.  It's very sad to say that when we first entered this school 7 years ago, the grade was an A. And let it be stated that through all those years the CTT & IEP students did not BRING THE SCHOOLS TEST SCORES DOWN!  The school maintained a high ranking for many years before the re-introduction of G&T. To blame children who may have learning disabilities is just ignorant and biased.

Make no mistake about it, the one thing that made this school awesome was it's community support. This community is larger than the *affluent parents* along grand street.  The school is flanked on both sides by NYCHA complexes. Coincidentally, District 1 is home to over 15 housing complexes. 4 of which have a high population of students that attend PS 110. That is the community that raised PS 110 to score so highly year upon year.

The school is doing great and even through our old principal left the school this pat school year she like the principal before her helped the school in many ways. The new principal is making many good changes to our very strict system. And yes in many ways I still struggle i  Chinese but the mandarin teachers are always reminding us of our work. So shout out to them for being great and having the patience to deal with us weird middle schoolers( Mr. Tao and Mrs. Sandra)😊😊. It really is a great place to study at and would really recommend it for people if they are wondering for a school to send their children to.

01M184,Emily Zhou,manhattan,K-8,642,"Shuang Wen has always been a very tight knit, yet welcoming group of students and faculty members and has excelled because of its care and attentiveness towards students. 

As a student that graduated two years ago and now attends a top school in New York, I can proudly say that I have been taught and enriched with such a welcoming and knowledgeable staff. My years in Shuang Wen were nothing but growth and hard work, fortified by a relentless passion for learning that each teacher shared. 

Chinese was always a second language and I speak English mainly. However, I can write, read, and communicate fluently in Mandarin with teachers, family members, and relatives just because of a few classes, not because I was born Chinese. Therefore, the allegations that Shuang Wen is only for Asians and that any other race is doomed to fail in Shuang Wen is beyond absurd. I came into Shuang Wen knowing how to speak Cantonese, a whole other dialect that actually can negatively hinder the learning of Mandarin. That being said, ANYONE can attend Shuang Wen and successfully learn Mandarin, just like I did. The ability to perform and perfect is mainly on the student, as a true craftsman does not blame his tools for his imperfections. Every student is given the same attention and knowledge, and it is up to them to grasp and absorb. Even if they fail to, I do not know one teacher in Shuang Wen that was not willing to sit down in their free time to explain it again.

In addition, Shuang Wen isn't racist or racially exclusive to Asians. The school embraces anyone that comes with an open heart and an open mind that is willing to learn. Anyone that was part of the student body was part of the family that made the learning experience thorough and enjoyable. Attending Shuang Wen means accepting and willing to learn Chinese and all the knowledge that is offered, and does not mean being forced, unhappily to take on a Chinese class. 

Education is a virtue that everyone has a choice to take and to refuse. Do not blame the school or the teachers because you found it as a vice. I did not and am forever grateful for the skills and intellect that I was able to acquire over the years at Shuang Wen.",17,1,0,2014-01-31T16:38:47,0.75,0.154,0.16699999999999998,0.016,0.6759999999999999,0.131,0.519,0.701,0.042,0.129,0.07200000000000001,0.046
01M184,Caroline,manhattan,K-8,642,"As a former graduate from this school, it is an extreme frustration to see so many false statements both in the website's review and the discussion section. Shuang Wen is truly an honorable school that I am utmost proud of for having been able to attend. As a new immigrant with no Mandarin background, I was able to become fluent in Mandarin with the help of both the daytime Chinese teachers, such as Ms. Tsao, and the afterschool Chinese teachers from SWAN. Despite the ignorance of those not having learned Chinese before, Chinese is an extremely challenging language that can only be learned if one is willing to put time and effort into learning it. I admit that I even considered dropping out because it was hard, but with the encouragement of my parents, I decided to continue. My fluency in Mandarin has allowed me to be considered for jobs over candidates who do not have this advantage. Every time I encounter a situation when Mandarin is used, I am reminded of how grateful I am to Shuang Wen and all the members of the Shuang Wen family for helping me be the successful person I am today. 
Visiting Shuang Wen now is a whole other story. Not only are a great number of teachers that have worked for numerous years in Shuang Wen been leaving, but the team spirit and the sense of community has slowly begun to drift apart.

01M184,Andy  3024-5823-1265,manhattan,K-8,642,"What happened to this school came out of no where. It took not only the parents by surprise, but the kids there as well. I started at Shuang Wen as a kindergartener, and I can say that SWS was not just a place I went to everyday but school, but it was also my family. At Shuang Wen, I met my best friend, whom still is my best friend to this day. Shuang Wen prepared me as a well rounded person as I entered high school, and taught me responsibility and social manners. 
It's sad that a few parents feel that their child did not get the same experience that I have, but it's even worse to ruin other's education because of that reason. Many students transferred out of SWS when our old principal was forced to step down, and many teachers left as well. Our principal was the building block of SWS, and she created the community and environment of the school we all felt so safe in. To the parents that got her forcefully removed, was it really our school that made your child feel that way? Or was it just you that could not accept that a school like SWS with such a unique environment existed. 
There were many options that you could have taken, one being to remove your child from our school, and not ruin the educational experience of so many others. 
I sincerely hope these parents that caused these events to Shuang Wen realize the sadness they've brought to so many students, and realize that doing so, did not bring happiness to their own child. Think about all the friendships you've ruined for your child in the process, and think about the monstrous acts that you've taught your child for their future.",6,0,0,2014-01-31T16:21:55,0.75,0.154,0.16699999999999998,0.016,0.6759999999999999,0.131,0.519,0.701,0.042,0.129,0.07200000000000001,0.046

P.S is clearly a public school. Where did you see ""limousines"" dropping kids off? Are you sure it wasn't just a Jeep? Stop hating on the Asians. The school offers both English and Chinese. If people in the neighborhood are reluctant to apply because they don't want to learn Chinese or because of the majority of Asian people there, then you cannot blame them (the kids attending the school) for it. 
Secondly, parents still have to pay for their children to attend the afterschool program. They are not being forced into it.

Yet, I don't see anything about the fact that English is being addressed because it was not earlier, nor do I see anything about grammar or the fact that many parents don't have their children attend SWAN anymore.  Is it because it is so superior in teaching Mandarin?  Why would these parents who have fought so hard to keep SWAN in the school abandon it?  The point is not the ethnic makeup of the Asians in the school the point is that the school is becoming better and with the change it will at some point have to rid itself of SWAN.  As I have pointed out my daughter attends New York Chinese and even when she attended full time it never cost $1,000.00. Yet we have a program that is in a public school, paid no rent during the tenure of Ms. Ling-Ling Chou and charged first $300, then $600, and now $1200.00 for Mandarin. It is also known that the vocabulary didn't prepare students for any Social Studies program in either Middle School or High School, which was proven by even native speaker students being unable to do the work in the Social Studies program as taught by Ms. Tsao. Yet, these comments with no proof, nor documentation are put forth as if written in the law.  There is a reason that the program stopped receiving funding, and it is not because it was such a wonderful program.  I find it interesting where does this writer live?

The D.O.E. needs to be taken to task to explain this as it is a Public School and is mandated to teach  Mandarin to all its students equally. I am glad that emphasis is being put on grammar and English skills as when my daughter went the English was sub par and this caused students to flounder when they reached High School.  I have recordings of S.L.T. meeting where this was discussed and teachers of upper grades were frustrated due to students returning and complaining that they couldn't do the work in English Language expected of them. It is also under very good leadership as Ms. Chiu has worked in another school where there were divisions and worked to bring about harmony among the students.  I feel that there should be more programs that respect all cultures and not just Asian culture (read Chinese) in the school to reflect the African and Latin roots of most of the community.

It is interesting to me that when I was at the school, a group of parents belittled speaking English on more than a perfunctory level and even attacked parents who felt the English level should be better.  I remember my father who I learned used records to perfect his English but apparently these parents felt that ignorance of the English language was something to be applauded.  I find this discussion boring and your level or response the same as the ignorant parents I dealt with while at Shuang Wen.  Why is an 8th grader, if indeed you are an 8th grader be interested in trying to match wits with someone who first of all Teaches English, and second of all has educated three children two who have their own businesses and one who is on her way to becoming a mover and shaker in the film business.

The many students also didn't do very well in English, this is not an insult but fact.  You cannot improve if what is projected is a myth, it doesn't do the students any good to be told that their English is great when it is not. It also doesn't help them when faced with a curriculum in Social Studies that they don't understand.

01M315,Martha Kessler,manhattan,Elementary,297,"Transitioning to middle school is a big change for every kid. Many have only known one school and have been there for as long as 7 years. A kid going into 6th grade in a new school is going to have to make a big adjustment no matter how well prepared they are. New school, new teachers and classmates, hormones kicking in, of course it's overwhelming. It's our job as parents to support them through the transition and that's a hard job.

What does it mean to be prepared for middle school? Academically, EVCS is one of the top ranking schools in the district based on the test results of the last couple of years, so you can't mean that! When I bump into last years' 5th graders and ask them how it's going they all wail about how much homework they have - but they all seem to be happy in the school of their choice and last years' 5th graders all were accepted into their first choice school. So are you saying we should increase the amount of homework our 4th and 5th graders get so they won't be so shocked by their workload in middle school? Try telling them that and then block your ears.

As to meeting the needs of children with special needs: EVCS has a higher than average number of children with IEP's - it's an environment that has always felt welcoming to families of children who don't fit the mold because the school's ideology is about embracing learning differences and supporting children who struggle in a traditional classroom environment.

Our family feels very lucky to have landed in this school. Our oldest child struggled so much in K-2 and with the support, encouragement and amazing commitment of his teachers is now performing above grade level with great test scores and a passion for learning.  What more can you ask from a public school?",1,0,1,2012-12-07T04:57:14,1.0,0.017,0.172,0.006999999999999999,0.365,0.037000000000000005,0.23199999999999998,0.08800000000000001,0.047,0.226,0.586,0.16

Our principal has been a strong advocate for EVCS as we've pushed back against the DOE's suggestion that we move our students to an inappropriate building. (She may be soft-spoken, but that should not be confused with unassertive.) Our vice principal is intimately involved with curriculum changes as well as our after-school and in-class music programs (he often accompanies students' on his guitar). Our building is in need of repair ... and about to get it (but this is largely in the hands of the School Construction Authority).

WHy would that be the focus or the one big change for the upcoming year since pretty much not one of the pre-k children this year require such services.  Also I think it is far too ""busy"" to have a bridge class (k/1st) which is also a CTT (collaborative team teaching: 60% general ed students/40% special education).  That seems to be too much going on in one classroom  even for 2 teachers especially at such an important place in their learning development.

They see class as an opportunity and are highly motivated to succeed. In the cases where students have a difficult time managing their own behaviors, support is given and consequences are enforced.

How many times did you attend an SLT meeting?  A PTA meeting?  A parent workshop, trip or event?  Ultimately, creating a superlative school environment is every community members responsibility. Parents are not silent partners.  When parents and guardians attend SLT meeting, the annual school-wide retreat or PTA meetings, when families read the policies and procedures we regularly send to homes, they can develop working knowledge of the systems UNMS has in place to deal with safety, discipline and middle school adolescent issues that include self-esteem, image and negotiating peer relationships.

I respectfully disagree;
The school is very inclusive, open-minded, very concern and available to offer help in whatever way possible.
A public school doesn't always have the resources, financial and not, to overcome all the obstacle they may face but you can be sure that they will do the best is humanly possible to move forward.
Elementary school does not have to create super star monsters, it has to show the kids how to be decent human being first ....
they have to learn how to behave in a mini world such their classroom.
I find those comment very white and judgmental when the only thing to do is to offer more to your kids by participating in the curriculum, integrate with more home work if you think needed.

01M361,piedodo,manhattan,Elementary,284,"I am a happy parent at CWS.  Maria (our Principal) has a clear vision for how our children should be educated and does an amazing job of delivering a progressive education despite drastic budget cuts, high-stakes testing, overcrowding, and an old building that needs major upgrades.  There is no doubt in my mind that Maria and her staff actually live the principles of peace, community and love that they teach to our children.  I doubt that such integrity and commitment exist at most schools.  As for the basics -- reading, writing, math -- the school bends over backwards to make sure that the children master these subjects within the progressive model.  Given the high-stakes testing, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide substantive art, dance, music and yes, even SCIENCE (not a subject on the primary school tests).  Children all learn in different ways and their intelligence and talents take different forms.  I believe that CWS strives to give all the children the chance to shine.",8,0,0,2012-02-15T20:37:26,1.0,0.039,0.271,0.006999999999999999,0.532,0.106,0.387,0.095,0.102,0.405,0.35200000000000004,0.258
01M361,Hope Guajardo,manhattan,Elementary,284,"I taught at CWS for one year sixteen years ago. I had been teaching in a regular school in the same building, and had been bumped by somebody who had been bumped, etc., etc. I went back to pick up my belongings and to take one last walk through the corridors of CWS. I was going to miss the wonderful projects that children had made. I was lucky to be offered a half-time position by Maria, who was familiar with the many dance performances I had done for the other school. I ended up being shared by CWS and The Neighborhood School. What a wonderful beginning to my career as a teacher. My memories of the devoted teachers, progressive methods and enriched curricula still outshine anything I've experienced in the fifteen years since. It was at CWS that I was first exposed to wonderful programs from Teachers College and Bank Street College. Those programs arrived several years later in Millburn, NJ, where I've taught for the past ten years. So CWS was years ahead of what is considered the top school district in a very wealthy part of New Jersey.
      As for the 'laid back' atmosphere, what I experienced was the true integration of the arts and academia. Children worked independently and with friends, completely engrossed in their projects. I've never been in a school that succeeds in integrating the arts -- they are always somewhere on the periphery. 
      As for criticisms of Maria Velez-Clarke, my NJ school went through five principals in ten years. The fabulous ones rarely lasted more than a year, and only the ones that oozed obsequiously in front of parents managed to survive. They were the ones that knew little about educating children and cared less. Principals that give their energy and attention to the children, not to their parents, are focused on the most challenging job one can imagine. Sorry if they fall short on PR skills.
     As for standardized tests, I've prepared children for those tests for sixteen years, and I never cease to be horrified by how inappropriate they are. Rarely do the reading passages relate to any child's schema or life experience. So children can read them but they don't really 'get' the meaning. And math word problems are written to be confusing, often talking about things like stock options. Just reading a term like that makes a child give up. Judging a school by its students' test scores is really a mistake. One of my NJ principals did little more than teach to the test. Our scores were great, were heralded all over the school in banners that you had to duck under as you walked through the halls. That showed what he cared about!
     As for text books and workbooks, many elementary schools have moved away from them and for good reason. I've rarely seen an ELA textbook that is worth much, and workbooks, like those glossy phonics disposables, are primarily money-makers for the publishing companies. A good teacher can do so much better. Everyday Math is a terrific program and I would guess it is used at CWS. Homework creates tremendous stress for many families, and if you really want to help your children, read to them, engage them in the math involved in shopping and meal planning, etc. Homework frequently displaces these more intimate and meaningful activities.
     If I had known about CWS and been able to get my daughter in, I wouldn't have moved out of NYC. My daughter was in a gifted and talented program in the upper west side, and we moved to NJ because of the teacher's rigidity and complaints that my daughter, at six, wasn't a fluent reader. When I tried to discuss her homework with the teacher, I was told to 'mind my own business'. Top grades on five AP courses and three Dartmouth engineering degrees later, I look back at her rough start in the NYC public schools and wish I had known about The Children's Workshop School.

01M361,Devoted Parent,manhattan,Elementary,284,"Our family has been a part of the Children's Workshop School ""family"" for 10 years. Our children, two of whom are shy, were nurtured, valued and challenged here. In general, the teachers are excellent—bright, energetic, organized and devoted. Our kids been so fortunate to have had Helen, Suma, Scott, Miriam and Jessica who are talented and dedicated. Yes, there are a few clunkers, but not as many as at my sister's kids' posh private school, or at the highly-rated schools I attended as a child. Someone mentioned that their child did not learn how to write—this is next to impossible at this school; there is a piece of personal information that that parent is withholding. People have criticized Maria Velez-Clark for being off-putting, but my feeling is that she is somewhat shy, and I know for a fact she is devoted to the children. The school was founded by Maria and another educator who moved to Finland—it is my understanding that she was the more outgoing spokesperson for the school. My kids have always felt that the could walk right into Maria's office to get a hug, display a lost tooth or share exciting news with Maria. In general, the parents who are most dissatisfied and angry are the parents of children who turn out to have special needs—and yes, the school does not do a great job of catering to kids with potential learning disabilities, especially if they're from a family that has the means to address it on their own. It's a small school with limited funds. The school was founded on the principles of Martin Luther King—peace (non-violence), integration of all races, ethnicities, and religions, and dedication to maintaining the freedoms that are our rights.

The teachers rarely give any homework, and the students do not study from text books or workbooks at home. I have never seen a book in five months! It is literally up to the parents to create lessons on their own if you want your child to actually learn something. Of course, they do not even mention this to parents, as you have to figure it out on your own. The school secretary rarely answers the phone, rarely returns phone calls and the phone lines are down often. If you have a question or an issue, good luck getting through! If you want your child to learn in an extremely laid back environment which promotes laziness, by all means- send your child to this school! It gets worse and worse as your child moves up in grades. I am glad to say that this will be my child's last year attending! Unfortunately, my child just may need to repeat a grade at another school due to lack of an education.

The teachers and administration do their very best to serve all of their children, under sometimes difficult circumstances, given the mixed backgrounds and incomes of families and the varying levels of participation among parents. But that diversity is another thing that makes this school so special, and there is an enormous emphasis on compassion, tolerance and kindness at this school - something that I've not seen elsewhere. My kids have LOVED their experience at CWS -- each of them has at some point expressed their desire to be teachers when they grow up so that they can go back and teach there! It's not always perfect, but then no school is. I think some of the parents who've written here about being dissatisfied have unrealistic expectations. If you want the faculty and administration to greet you personally when you enter the building, a private school may be a better choice for your family.

He loves to read and has great comprehension skills, but he has serious issues with writing that the ""loose atmosphere"" at CWS failed to recognize and treat. The school failed to support him when he was bullied. At the time I wanted to support the staff because I dislike over-empowered parents who always take their child's side, but in retrospect my child needed defending. I'm sad that I wasn't there for him  at that time.The teachers are either stunningly capable or stunningly inept, there was very little middle ground. My son's third grade was a hodgepodge that started out with a premature promotion of a teacher's assistant, then his removal and replacement with another rookie who could barely control the children. It was a disruptive year. Fourth grade was outstanding and my son thrived under a teacher who maintained order without screaming (one teacher was notorious for hollering). At the same time CWS should be praised for it's inclusiveness and the devotion of some staff. CWS has wild variations in parental support, from artist parents who contribute loads of support to parents in the projects who want better for their children but are stretched thin.

From my experience, Global Leaders is a small community who cares tremendously about the quality of education and relationships formed between us all (parents, teachers and students). The Dual Language Mandarin program happens to be a very instrumental part for us. I feel it offers versatility, diversity and an advantage for when the students prepare to enter High School.

01M378,C Jacinta Madhere,manhattan,Middle,250,"I have had the privilege of being a parent at Global Leaders since 2014. My middle son began school there in 2014 and now my youngest daughter is a 7th grader. I remember when SGL was ""born"" and I was skeptical. I had an older son enter the 6th grade that year and I was skeptical just because they were so new and I didn't take the leap. Five years later, I was sure SGL was the right choice for my younger son, with small class size and project based learning. And never have I been happier with a school! My son left Global Leader to attend an elite boarding school in Pennsylvania as an Oliver Scholar. As he was leaving the school to move forward in his success, my daughter was entering the school into their Dual Language Mandarin program. Unfortunately, the end of my daughter's elementary school experience was not a very good one and academically she was suffering. She had gone from scoring 3 and 4 on the statewide test to scoring low 2s. And with the tutelage and dedication of the teachers at SGL my daughter went from low 2s to 4s on BOTH state exams. I could not have been happier. The faculty and staff at SGL reinvigorated her love for learning and their dedication to her success reminded her that she could believe in herself and succeed. Both of my SGL students were not only academically challenged, but they have benefited from the plethora of extra curricular activities available to them, both being involved in the many varsity sports available, art, choral music and theater. My daughter this year participated in the school rendition of The Lion King Jr and IT WAS PHENOMENAL!

I have also spent most of the time as a parent at SGL serving on the Executive Board of the PTA. This year the PTA sponsored Career Day bringing 20 professionals from all walks of life and industries to share their work experience and educational experience with our students. Career Day was super successful enjoyed by teachers, students and presenters alike.

AT SGL, we are a true family and believe in educating and supporting the whole child. I am so glad that both my youngest children have had an opportunity to share in this community. It was definitely the BEST choice we could have made. My son was WELL prepared for his journey to high school. As my daughter rises to the 8th grade, I have no doubt she will be well prepare for whatever her high school journey will be.",0,0,0,2019-06-13T18:21:13,1.0,0.1,0.38799999999999996,0.096,0.848,0.23199999999999998,0.748,0.128,0.23600000000000002,0.564,0.04,0.41

It is an ""A"" school and the staff, students and parents should be very proud of it. I Every time I need to meet with the dean, or any school administrators, they were available. Ms. Chan is always willing to meet with me even when I don't have an appointment. She is dedicated and cares a lot about her students. When I email the teachers, they always respond back.

You stated that you enrolled your daughter into the school because of the wonderful teachers and Mrs. Chan. How did you get to know the staff WELL, or at all for that matter, before you enrolled her in SGL? One thing about my kid is that he never gets into trouble and is extremely respectful of his fellow peers and staff. I get praises about my son during Parent Teacher Conference. I can care less about the school being an ""A"" school. There are many ""A"" schools out there that have many unhappy parents and students and an extremely rude staff. I have two other kids that attend a ""C"" school and I absolutely LOVE the school as well as my kids do. My kids have had a solid education in that school and the staff is warm and extremely attentive. The school grading system has its pros and cons. Really dig into exactly how the grading system works to get a better understanding. Many parents see an ""A"" school grading and assume ""GREAT""!... bad assumption. Go figure why Mayor Bill de Blasio is seeking to rid the grading system. Anyway, I'm glad all is working out for your daughter and NO, I'm not transferring my son to another school. He graduates this year. He has been accepted into a so-called wonderful school with a so-called great staff.

You are entitled to an opinion, yes, but i must correct you, the teachers and students 'respect' her, the assistant Ms Hickey works well with her, Ms. Alvarez, Ms. Gerry, Ms. Brandon, is wonderful as well....the only person on the staff my daughter has told me that some of her peers 'talk' about some of the staff/teachers but hey they are adolescents,,,kids express themselves differently,,,equivelant to adults who talk about their bosses behind their backs,,,Ms. CHan personally gave me a tour when we signed my daughter up that first summer the school was going to open...she handed my daughter the reading books for the summer and said that my daughter was expected to bring in reports on what she read by the first day of school. So she is tough? Yes, I'm not surprised to hear that some students/teachers are 'annoyed' or have conflicts, but she is a leader and is not supposed to be Ms. Nice guy,,,,it would not work.....also afterschool is offerred in the building by Beacon, (Grand Street Settlement) the afterschool given by the SGL is not sufficient i would agree, one thing i agree on...regarding your post, but again we are all entitled to our own opinion....just know i am a parent indeed,,very proud one at that! 

Good luck to you and your child by the way, i'm not sure if your child is a senior, but there is enough stress with waiting to find out about what HS my kid is accepted in (letters should be coming in the mail next week 3/31).",1,1,2,2011-03-16T00:57:19,1.0,0.1,0.38799999999999996,0.096,0.848,0.23199999999999998,0.748,0.128,0.23600000000000002,0.564,0.04,0.41

Educators vary in the way they monitor classroom discussion, and a real conversation among peers rarely involves hand-raising.

Nest has always been very competitive to get into especially the middle and upper grades but if you are strongly urged to apply if you have interest. With COVID the admissions criteria will probably change for Nest and all screened schools. Because Nest is far from the nearest subway and the commute will include a long walk or bus ride, I suggest all map out your commute and think about whether that is something you want to do every day in a post COVID world where it is hard to social distance on public transportation.

In the first day of school，we just doing some ice breaker activities. The teachers want us fit into the school as soon as possible. Usually the first period for freashman will have teather or band. The teather teacher Mr. Yusah is amazing，he made a lot jokes in class，you will learn a lot from him. And the English teacher Ms. Gordon is also great，she made me love to read books. Also，i saw a comment about the school at the bottom that said Nest is not a peaceful school，that is not really ture，everyone in the school is really welcome to the freshman，i did’t see any bully or fight happen in our school yet.  After i talked about so many pros of the school，i have to tell some cons at Nest to you，Nest＋m is k to 12  school，which is a point that some people might dont like. But the upper grade，middle grade，and the lower grade are separated. So you will not see the little kids in school at all. If you think you live really far away from the school，trust me you wont be the farthest one. Many of my friends come from Brooklyn，Queens，mahanttan upper east sides，and even Staten Island. Nest＋ m ranked top three high school in nyc，come here you wont be regret. If you have any questions about Nest＋m high schools or orther public high schools in nyc，you can leave a comment to me，i will try my best to help you.,0,0,0,2019-09-18T03:15:10,0.75,0.023,0.054000000000000006,0.002,0.19399999999999998,0.01,0.10099999999999999,0.36700000000000005,0.04,0.076,0.414,0.047

1.Since this is a school from k-12 are the friend groups already made? How hard is it to fit in? (I'm a pretty shy and quite student)
2.How good is the college support?
3.Do they have AP or honors classes?
4.How big are each classes?
5.I was also thinking of applying to schools like Townsend or baccalaureate, but I'm not sure what to put first.
6.What is it like to get to class to class? Is it crowded?
7. Was the transition from middle school to high school hard?
8.I lean more towards as a humanities person and was wondering how good the ela and social studies were. I'm still very interested in science, math, and computer science though.

1）Its really easy to make firends here，because Nest is a small high school  you will know each others well in the school. But if you attend to those big high schools like brooklyn tech ，trust me is gonna be super hard to make friends there. 
2）I am not sure about how good the college support is in this school，because im a freshman this year. But i know many students graduated from Nest they all went the top collages like MIT，Yale ，and even Harvard. 
3）There are alot AP courses in Nest，it has a 70 percent AP enrollment to the students.
4）Each class has about 30 students
5）Nest and Townsend are both pretigious，go to the open house first，then make the choice.
6）You just walk to the class through the hallways. The hallways in Nest is autually fine if you compare to other schools
7）Yea，nothing is easy. But your teachers and friends will help a lot at this time.
8）The history teacher Ms. Allen and the English teacher Ms. Gordon are awesome，you gonna learn a lot from them.

01M539,Sammy,manhattan,K-8,1139,Nest is a wonderful high school！！！In my opinion，Nest is not worse than those specialize high schools. I got into Brooklyn tech and Nest. After i did a lot research online and went to the open house and orientation of both high school. I really decided to go with Nest. Nest has a more great environment than tech. It located in Manhattan downtown，really close to the ocean.That is a thing that i like. Nest offers various of AP courses，especially in the math area. If you like math or  good at math that you really consider this school to be one of your option. One more reason that i pick this school is because the size of this school is not as huge as brooklyn tech. Only six hundreds students in the upper grade. In a small size high school，you can know everyone in your grade，more chances to find some friends. Imagine that you have to meet up with seven thousands people in a day. That is gonna be horrible.

School has a very warm culture, kids don't seem to be particularly tuned into how other kids are doing academically. Much more collaborative than competitive. There is homework, but it does not feel overly intense, and there is no homework on weekends or school breaks.

01M839,L.A.,manhattan,Middle,362,"TSMS is an awesome middle school! Every teacher I have ever had still has that enthusiasm that keeps a person attentive. They put their kids at the highest priority as they guide them through what is widely known as a pretty hard and hellish phase for every anxiety ridden adolescent. (It really is *that stage.* Eek! Right?) Classrooms are bright and welcoming and teaching strategies are specialized for the students. You'll discover more about who you are and what you want for yourself, both now and in the future. You're encouraged to think for yourself as you deepen ideas and solutions, none of that ""read this, answer that, now let me take my hourly dose of caffeine and struggle to remain till the end of the day."" rubbish. I've made mistakes here and there all through my life but I can assure you that going to this school was not one of them, and that at both the highest and lowest points of my academic career I have felt supported in all the aspects of me.

Additional notes;
*Two teachers per classroom
*Introverts are not forced to ""come out of their shell"" and are instead encouraged to find innovative ways to participate and be comfortable
*Down to earth counselors available at all times and are both approachable and kind
*Academics and arts taken seriously! (Will be attempting to go to an arts high school myself.)
*Advisory is every Tuesday and Thursday all three years and is a time for making sure every student is doing okay. If they need any help at all, they will get it.
*High school applications are walked through in school with different advisors, arts teachers, and counselors.
*Might be cliche, but really feels like a family. For both students and you guys; the nervous parents! The middle school process is gonna be okay. Take a breather.

01M839,PGC,manhattan,Middle,362,"This school, overall, was phenomenal. I graduated last year, and I am in high school now. In hindsight, there were, in my opinion, a few problems. Firstly, I felt as if the principal wasn't very skilled in dealing out punishments to students, but I suppose I could attribute that to him being a fairly new principal. Compared to the school's old principal, I don't believe he met the standard. I am hoping that has changed. He is a very nice person, though, and was very relaxed. I think I speak for the majority of my graduating class when I say that we generally liked him.Another thing is, the school was fairly diverse, but often times students would go off into their own different cliques. I think that this can be expected in almost all schools, but I don't think it should be expected from a school that claims to be diverse. If a student is determined enough though, they can most definitely make friends with all of the students, like I did. If you allow yourself to drift from group to group and make many friends, it'll be fun. From what I experienced, all of my classmates were friendly and I made a lot of amazing friends.A third thing that truly disappointed me though were those stereotypical ""bad kids"" or ""slackers."" It seems that every one of my classmates at TSMS was incredibly smart, but there were always the select few who didn't put their intelligence to good use and caused trouble. It seemed that when these kids would cause disruptions, the situations weren't always properly handled, but then again, it did give us, the students, some entertainment.Also, although it is a matter of opinion, I didn't feel the head guidance counselor fulfilled the expectations for her job. I didn't find her to be very helpful during the high school selection process, and I found myself talking to my advisor more than I did to her about it. It's fairly difficult to meet with her if you are a student (especially during the high school selection process) because it gets incredibly difficult to wait with ten other students in one little room during your 45 minute lunch hour. On a side note, one thing to take advantage of is the counseling the school offers. It's incredibly helpful. The students usually meet with interns instead of the guidance counselor herself. Some upsides to the school would be the incredibly diverse student body, the option to take Integrated Algebra, fairly entertaining classes, our advisories, the humanities class I had that was taught by Lance (he's an amazing teacher--by far my favorite--and I suggest you talk to him if you go in for a tour), and the few nice trips we took. Our senior trip to D.C. was amazing (and I think I could say that it was the highlight of my three years there) even though it was only for a day. Last year, there were a few memorable incidents, such as maybe three fights (all 8th graders from what I can remember), and  some students being caught smoking in the bathroom. A lot of kids received dean's detentions or were suspended last year, as well. Once I got into high school, I could tell that I was more than adequately prepared. I truly did love this school (and I do miss it) but I could tell that all of us wanted to get out of there by the time we were in eighth grade. In fact, we all said it.

Ms. Lisa Cheu. Her Amazing Pumpkin project immerses the four year olds in a
hands on real-life journey of “Pumpkin Jack” from seed to moldy mulch that
culminates into a huge booth in the Annual School Science Fair in February.  

PTA involvement has quadrupled. They increased school pride with events like Spirit Day, Movie nights and the Carnival. 

There are now smart boards in almost every classroom. They changed from TERC 
to Singapore Math two years ago to meet the new common core standards. 

Playworks is helping students find their leadership skills while having fun. 

Meanwhile, the teachers look for creative collaborative ventures to make study fun
 like the “Flappy Bird” program that introduced students to programming 
last year in Ms. Malt's computer class

They have Art and Music. Ms.Chan's Choir sings songs in different languages and the Drama Class (Ms.Sklaire) performed Aladdin (before it was a musical), Annie, Cinderella and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

PS 2 won a grant from Apple this year that will give every student an iPad to use 
in class and every teacher a laptop. That is, as soon as they finish the 
upgrades to the wireless in the building.

Students who came from PS41 (to Salk, in 6th grade) were further behind in their academics, and lacked the caring persona shown in so many PS3 kids. On holdover, Lisa is only trying to do what is best for her students, so they can fully grasp what they have learned, the assumption that she is only doing it for test scores is completely unjustified.

She takes the time to fully get to know each individual student, when I come back to visit, she recognizes me and engages in specific conversation about how I am doing.

02M003,bravelittlegerda,manhattan,Elementary,677,"Something is off in PS 3! The school administration is weirdly pro-holdover, and I am starting to wonder why.  Could it be that kids with lower grades or lower scores are messing up the school’s stats?  Could holding the child back help them hide the lower stat?  Whatever is happening, more and more families are feeling betrayed and frustrated by the school’s very forceful approach, insisting on holdover as a one-size-fits-all solution for vastly different kids with issues ranging from minor to major.  

I have two extremely different kids at two totally different ends of the spectrum as far as learning (one very bright and very mature but unfocused, one with processing issues and not as mature but very focused), and the school threatened to hold back my one child last year and my other one this year!  The worst of it is that in both cases I asked for my kids to be tested or have special help, and the teachers spent the first half of the school year saying no to testing and demanding that I fix the problem at home.  I do spend a lot of time working with my kids, reading to them, doing art projects, practicing a little math, all the good stuff as time for a busy working single mom permits.  I did work hard with my older child at home last year and was very happy with her progress.  But then last February the teacher told my child she'd be held back WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST.  She came home hysterically crying and confused.  Only when I wrote a very angry letter and asked it to be put in her file did they send a holdover letter, but the principal would not meet with me.  I must have called for an appointment twenty times before giving up. Then I started putting everything in writing.  I asked for more scaffolding (good for my child and all the kids!) and tried to get assignments and units in advance so I could help do the scaffolding myself.  The teacher was unable to give me these tools or to show me what strategies she was using to reach not only my kid but all the kids in the class who might need extra help.  

The teacher dangled holdover over my child’s head the rest of that semester, really threatening her with it whenever she did anything wrong or didn’t succeed at something academically, until she hated school and had zero self-confidence left.  Finally at the very end of the year they invited me to a meeting, made me wait for a week without telling me what the meeting was about until both my child and I were ready to snap with the pressure.  I had to bring a friend to the meeting because I was afraid I would cry or lose it or both.  I brought a list of 60 learning strategies for kids with poor focus so that I could ask the teacher which, if any, she had used, though I knew she had probably not used one.  The meeting seemed more like a chance for them to save face than to be a team working together for the child.  But at least they told me they would “allow” her to go to the next grade, so I put my list of strategies away and our family was released from the terrible tension and pressure that destroyed my child’s belief in her own abilities.  Only this year was she able to rebuild that confidence and start to achieve -- and finally to get extra help for focus problems with SETTS teachers.

With my next child, who I knew had real special learning needs, I was determined not to let that happen.  I asked for testing on the first day of school, and was put off until December.  Finally the slow process fell into place, the testing was undertaken by the really amazing IEP team.  (And by the way, the IEP team is AMAZING, but I get the sense the team is severely limited in what they can do and how far they can go as advocates.)  Finally we met with all his teachers and the IEP team to discuss his diagnosed disability and to come up with a plan for his future, a supportive and wonderful plan that took into account his gifts and his needs and would put him in an ICT class next fall but leave him with his current class this year where he was so happy, but offer support with pull outs with a reading and speech specialist a few times per week.  I was told that he had real needs in ONE area but was otherwise average or above in terms of national standards.  I was feeling really good about everything and even about the school for the first time.  I taught him subtraction over the vacation, and was so proud that he got it even though his class hadn’t started it yet.  

But a week later, I get handed a holdover letter by the teacher who had just been in the meeting advocating for my child!  I felt so betrayed!  What was the point of developing this wonderful plan and recognizing my child’s needs and designing an approach to help him succeed, including an ICT class for the fall, if they were just going to threaten to fail him instead of undertaking the great work we had agreed upon?  All the trust I had in his teacher and the school was dissolved in an instant. 

Then I began asking around, and I learned that many families are facing the same problem and had almost the same experience across the board.

I have done a lot of reading about this, and there is no research that proves that holdover is an effective strategy for most kids at whatever level of risk.  There are ZILLIONS of academic journals featuring articles DISPROVING the efficacy of holdover.  Effective strategies are found in the IEP approach and differentiated learning.  They REALLY work.  And they feed kids' belief in themselves and their ability to learn strategies that will help them for life.

In both cases, in all areas but one, my kids tested average or above average according to the IEP team’s very thorough testing program.  In both cases, my kids  made massive strides from September to December.  But it wasn’t fast enough for the administration at PS 3.  The standards at PS 3 are not the national average, but the Greenwich Village average.  None of the teachers we've had so far offer after-school tutoring, not even one day a week; instead many parents shell out big bucks for private tutors, kumon, music/art teachers, etc., to keep up -- or rather, to get ahead!  As a result, the level of achievement considered normal goes even higher, a C becomes too shocking (even if, for parents like me, a C is really okay!).  For kids not above the PS 3 average, the school forgets all about the idea of nurturing the whole child, forgets the many types of learning styles our kids may bring to the table, forgets the true power of the arts, whatever their website may say.  The parents here are amazing, they do so much as volunteers and to bring in great programs and raise money to pay for them.  There are also some amazing teachers here.  But as far as really valuing the whole child and training the teachers to use a variety of strategies to reach all kids, as far as holding ALL teachers to the best practices of student-centered learning and differentiated instruction, as far as seeing family and staff as a team working together to help each child reach his/her full potential, my experience has not been a good one.

Children who have English as a second language are legally not allowed to repeat grades. However, at this school many children who speak another language at home and receive ESL are held over.

I'm not usually prone to posting comments but, having read some of the earlier posts, I think it is important to offer a different perspective. I genuinely believe that the concerns are misplaced.


My child entered PS3 in kindergarten and has been in CTT/ICT classes throughout. Yes, the classroom atmosphere in the earlier years might have been lighter and more carefree. Yes, the teachers in the 4th grade might have more rules and run a tighter ship. Candidly, we considered a move to private school to avoid the 4th grade class based on what I now view as unfounded doubts. In the end, I am very glad we stayed at PS3 and very pleased with both 4th grade ICT teachers. My sense, watching the class, teachers and students closely, is that the atmosphere is appropriate for the age group and certainly nurturing when necessary.


Make no mistake: I am not a gung-ho PS3 cheerleader. I have spent many days in the office and with the school administrative staff advocating for my child and expressing dissatisfaction with how the school is managed in some areas, such as too many indoor recesses and subpar bathrooms. PS3 has its share of problems, but I'm sure it is not alone among New York City schools. For all of its faults, they are greatly outweighed by the benefits of PS3, many of which have been expressed in comments below.

My two kids went here and even with very different skills, strengths, and learning styles, they both demonstrate a shocking lack of basic education.  The math education in particular is a problem because while it seems like a great idea to emphasize ""concepts"", if they don't learn basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication (not to mention long division which they only seem to cover in one week), your child will never, ever catch up.

PS3 has many many CTT classes and they also offer 12:1:1 (which are 100% special Ed) for parents that feel a smaller, more restrictive class with more adults helping is necessary. PS3 is extremely pro-active and supportive of special needs. They've always approached my child as an individual and not just a collection of diagnosis'...My child also receives speech, Ot and pt.  I've never had to ""fight"" for services at this school.  There is also a special on-site autism spectrum support staff for Asd related issues - they support teachers by pushing in to classrooms and offering tips on helpful behavioral interventions, etc. I have been very happy with the overall support and regularly meet SN parents at other schools that remark on our experience as being other than the norm and something for which we should be grateful. The school based support team (psychologist, social worker and parent outreach) is amazing.  The teachers and therapist are available to meet most Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. I'm always a little confused that PS3 retains its rep as the ""less structured school"" as compared to ps41 for example. I think this is a holdover from hippie days perhaps :) Because when you walk down the halls during class time it's extremely quiet and looking into classrooms you see tidy spaces filled with kids busily working.  An non-chaotic environment is extremely important to me for my child - I would never have enrolled here if it seemed too ""laid back""...also, I have friends at 41 who have described it as being none too encouraging of parent involvement. This doesn't really work for many parents of special needs kids - so I'm very relieved we were able to get placement at 3 before zoning changed (we are now zoned for 41).  My one negative is that the principal is not great with parents - but because she obviously runs such a tight ship and employs such a great staff and support services - its not really been a problem as we've always gotten what we need from the staff.

Progressive schools like PS 3 tend to have less emphasis on test prep than more traditional schools.

02M006,manhattanmom,manhattan,Elementary,588,"Agree with the poster below.  PS6 has a group of dynamic and dedicated educators but in the years we've been there, we've watched as one after another have left for other schools.  Teachers who are engaged and beloved by parents seem to be shunned by the administration, perhaps in an attempt to level the playing field.  Often they are replaced by newer teachers, some of whom are also terrific but also head for the hills after a few years.  There is a huge emphasis placed on testing (and the accolades it brings like the mediocre Blue Ribbon award).  Test prep and teaching to the test are evident in every grade. However, PS6 seems to  change curriculum (especially math) almost every year which hardly gives faculty and children enough time to learn and/or see if it will be successful. Large amounts of money are dedicated to the ever-changing curriculum ideas, dollars that could be spent lowering the class size of 33 (in 1st grade and up) or replacing all the specials that have been cut in the last few years. Due to the huge size of classes and the curriculum, the children are memorizing and repeating back much of the day and children who have issues with this kind of learning are dealt with as behavior problems and singled out. The Principal is defensive and has a reputation for playing favorites.   Many families who would have previously moved to be a part of the PS6 zone seem to be moving to PS290 or 267 instead.  The school does have nice facilities- including a separate gym, library and auditorium and the PE and Science programs are highlights.

02M006,Ay Cee,manhattan,Elementary,588,"It is becoming increasingly obvious that this school is run by amazing teachers and that their trust in the principl dimishes each year.  According to the school survey results, the staff does not feel supported by the principal.  In my experience, (1 son just graduated and another recently entered) this principal favors parents who are socially connected or who donate the big bucks to get what they want.  I have heard over and over again that a donation will get you the class and teacher you like best.  I have also recently heard that they are hiring substiture teachers who are unlicensed to get around the rules and hire young staff.  I will say that I have found that the more seasoned teachers are among the very best here.

Cross-posting here as you never know where people have made accounts and where they haven't.  Will also cross-post to the PS33 InsideSchools comments section too.  Any insights appreciated.

Our older kid is going into K next year. We are zoned for PS6 and have an offer to PS33 G&T. I'm trying to think about the value of having a 5-10 minute walk to school (not to mention a school that is, according to most folks, a very good school with an incredible fundraising machine attached to it, involved parents, motivated kids, no potential G&T/gen-ed rift, the ability to have 92Y after school pick her up directly from PS6, etc.) vs. a 45-60 minute bus ride (each way) to a (again, according to most folks) strong G&T program -- i.e. having her surrounded ""only"" by G&T peers -- with excellent exmissions, probably better than PS6's at the margins. That's judging based on public school exmissions -- based on what the PS33 Open House shared and what can be found on the DOE website for the top 5 middle schools that PS6 feeds, that's my understanding thus far. Candidly, I haven't gotten much information on private exmissions for either program yet. (I don't know if our goal is public or private middle/high school. I think we just want to maximize optionality at this point, who knows what school will be the best place for her later on yet?) It seems to me that both PS6 and PS33 G&T are successful because of very involved parents. I've been told that my kid will be happy at PS6 and thrive there by educators who know her well. I don't know that a single kid from her preschool has ever gone to PS33 G&T. So we're just sort of flying a bit blind here.

Which leads me to: I'd love to hear from anyone who made the decision (either way) between these two programs -- what motivated the choice and how has the decision played out for your kid(s)/family? If you are willing to have a conversation offline, even better.

Also, my understanding is that if we register for PS33 G&T then our PS6 registration gets blown away and is then likely filled by someone on the PS6 K waitlist -- so if PS33 G&T turns out to be something besides what we hope it to be during K... then there's unlikely to be a path back to PS6 until 1st grade. But this isn't yet confirmed with DOE directly. Would love to know if anyone has knowledge/experience with this sort of situation and how it plays out.

I have heard the 33 bus can run very late at times — like well past 4pm on particularly bad days. Not often but just the sort of thing to stress you out in a way that being local never would. Would love to hear from any UES PS33 parents about how their kids’ after school activities are and how often the bus messes things up. Is this a real issue or not?

One parent suggested 33 is downside protection in the sense that you aren’t as likely to run into parents with a different educational philosophy and you aren’t going to land an ICT class. Now I’ve had friends who told me they dreaded ICT and it turned out amazing when their kid landed in the ICT class. I have no idea how difficult an ICT class may be to manage in a worst case scenario. But one thing you generally know in G&T anywhere is you won’t have ICT. I don’t know how much that’s really worth in terms of “downside protection” however. Would love to hear from anyone who has thoughts on ICT especially at PS6.",0,1,0,2019-06-10T12:33:35,1.0,0.037000000000000005,0.184,0.005,0.079,0.005,0.039,0.165,0.026000000000000002,0.061,0.731,0.065

02M006,Solomio,manhattan,Elementary,588,"The school has a wonderful community, but there is a caste system. The big contributors to the annual fund and other fundraising projects get preferential treatment from the administration (who will deny this, though all you have to do is look at the class list to who gets certain teachers). Parents of more modest means often feel intimidated or disinclined to get involved in school life. No matter how much money the PTA raises, it's never enough because the administration keeps dreaming up new things to spend it on. I would like to see the school put on more productions, for example, and to decrease the amount of time on test preparation, which increases each year. A very large number of fourth graders have private tutors to help prepare them for the state exams. Tutoring can start a year in advance of the actual tests. Although the teachers can take some credit for the students' performance, much of the credit also goes to the tutors and the parents who can afford their hefty fees (some people pay $200+ an hour for tutors).",0,0,0,2014-06-16T01:40:02,1.0,0.037000000000000005,0.184,0.005,0.079,0.005,0.039,0.165,0.026000000000000002,0.061,0.731,0.065

02M006,ps6parent,manhattan,Elementary,588,"I have had multiple children at PS 6 over a period of 7 years.  It is a large school, but the dedicated staff and PTA volunteers create many opportunities for intimacy, such as the specialized activities each grade participates in like Vital Theater, Stages of Learning (Shakespeare), etc.  There are many opportunities to volunteer as part of the PTA, but also through strictly school functions, such as Parents as Learning Partners held one morning each month, chaperoning trips, and attending school performances, chess team matches, track meets, and other community activities.

There are weaknesses, I do think.  Teachers are quite responsive to parent questions, but generally don't provide much feedback.  Most teachers are extraordinarily dedicated, smart and hard-working, but their primary interactions are with your child, not with you. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but for parents who think PS 6 is a free equivalent to private school, in this respect, it is certainly not.

Kids gain great independence and confidence in this school.  My children grew from timid 4 and 5 year olds in kindergarten to competent and confident 5th graders who were competitive in both private and selective public middle school admissions.

The administration is ambitious and performance driven, sponsoring additional after-school academic opportunities in order to improve test scores.  Nonetheless, they manage to welcome parent involvement and foster fun among students.  The quality of teaching has been high- teachers, aides, and student teachers.  The writing program is pretty strong and the curriculum includes a wide range of sciences and cultural arts.  There are abundant co-curricular opportunities, many sponsored by the PTA.  Some have hefty price tags and offer scholarships.  From what I've seen, diversity is treated kinda namby pamby here; plus, it's a big school with large classes so teachers don't necessarily go at each individual child's pace.  We have at times felt lost in the shuffle.  I've met other families who felt the school didn't meet their academic expectations and moved outside the city or sent their kids to private school.  I have more praise than complaint.",0,0,0,2011-09-05T15:41:36,1.0,0.037000000000000005,0.184,0.005,0.079,0.005,0.039,0.165,0.026000000000000002,0.061,0.731,0.065

Unfortunately, along with the demanding academics comes a pressure-cooker environment.  This is not a kind, gentle, ""every kid at his own pace"" school.  Instead, outside tutors are encouraged almost expected, especially in preparation for standardized tests.  Everything here is done with one goal in mind: Get those test scores up!  We have been here for four+ years, and I have generally liked my daughters' teachers. But I do not like the administration.  I feel they do not take enough of a ""holistic"" approach to education.  If you are looking for a down-to-earth parent body and a nurturing school, this is not the school for you.  However, if you are strictly looking for top notch academics, PS6 is fabulous.

The class had 'Z' readers and remedial readers taking guidance from the same teacher, but everyone picks their own leveled book to read. Some of the posted writing samples of her classmates were heartbreaking sad while others were so polished and smooth it was eyebrow raising.  Based on subject the kids are divided up academically by table cluster.  4 kids per cluster.  It must be hard on the teachers, but they pull it off.  The teachers use Columbia Teacher's College teaching methods, and even get special training for it.  One good thing about G&T is that it brings in wealthy proactive families from outside the zone which helps in PTA support.  Quite a few of her classmates received acceptance from the most selective D2 Middle Schools -- Clinton, Lab, Salk.

02M033,CFiles,manhattan,Elementary,599,"Our child attended pre-k at PS 33 during the 2018-19 school year. We were happy with the experience. Both of the pre-k teachers last year (there are two pre-k classes) were highly experienced and deeply invested in their students, and many of the kids, including ours, formed close bonds with their teachers. Our child's teacher did a great job being warm and caring while also helping our child correct some problematic behaviors and get ready for kindergarten, which seems like a hard balance to strike. The teachers also seemed to work hard to differentiate instruction for the kids based on their individual readiness, though with 18 kids at a wide range of developmental stages, there were no doubt some days where this worked better than others. 

There were many opportunities for parental involvement in the pre-k classes -- the usual run of holiday and birthday parties, but also monthly 'craft mornings' (in which parents could sign up to come in and do a craft or activity with the kids), a parent-child dance performance, one-off classroom demonstrations (e.g., a parent who came in to teach yoga to the kids), and so on. At least once a month we were in the classroom for one thing or another, and we appreciated those opportunities. The pre-k classes also take a lot of field trips: they went to the Atlantic Theater (twice), the marionette show at the Swedish Cottage, the New York Botanical Garden, the Bronx Zoo, and Sesame Street Live. Our kid loved these.

There were a few things we weren't wild about, but nothing major: 1) As is the case with many NYC schools, the building could stand to be renovated if not replaced entirely. 2) In an ideal world, there would be a class website or a weekly email or something that explained what was happening that week, how we could reinforce our child's learning that week at home, and so on. The teachers were always good about sharing that information if we asked, and of course they have plenty on their plates with what's happening in the classroom, but given how difficult it can be to get accurate information from four-year-olds about how they spent their days, having those details up front seems like it would help parents work with the teachers a little more.

Cross-posting here as you never know where people have made accounts and where they haven't.  Will also cross-post to the PS6 InsideSchools comments section too.  Any insights appreciated.

Our older kid is going into K next year. We are zoned for PS6 and have an offer to PS33 G&T. I'm trying to think about the value of having a 5-10 minute walk to school (not to mention a school that is, according to most folks, a very good school with an incredible fundraising machine attached to it, involved parents, motivated kids, no potential G&T/gen-ed rift, the ability to have 92Y after school pick her up directly from PS6, etc.) vs. a 45-60 minute bus ride (each way) to a (again, according to most folks) strong G&T program -- i.e. having her surrounded ""only"" by G&T peers -- with excellent exmissions, probably better than PS6's at the margins. That's judging based on public school exmissions -- based on what the PS33 Open House shared and what can be found on the DOE website for the top 5 middle schools that PS6 feeds, that's my understanding thus far. Candidly, I haven't gotten much information on private exmissions for either program yet. (I don't know if our goal is public or private middle/high school. I think we just want to maximize optionality at this point, who knows what school will be the best place for her later on yet?) It seems to me that both PS6 and PS33 G&T are successful because of very involved parents. I've been told that my kid will be happy at PS6 and thrive there by educators who know her well. I don't know that a single kid from her preschool has ever gone to PS33 G&T. So we're just sort of flying a bit blind here.

Which leads me to: I'd love to hear from anyone who made the decision (either way) between these two programs -- what motivated the choice and how has the decision played out for your kid(s)/family? If you are willing to have a conversation offline, even better.

Also, my understanding is that if we register for PS33 G&T then our PS6 registration gets blown away and is then likely filled by someone on the PS6 K waitlist -- so if PS33 G&T turns out to be something besides what we hope it to be during K... then there's unlikely to be a path back to PS6 until 1st grade. But this isn't yet confirmed with DOE directly. Would love to know if anyone has knowledge/experience with this sort of situation and how it plays out.

I have heard the 33 bus can run very late at times — like well past 4pm on particularly bad days. Not often but just the sort of thing to stress you out in a way that being local never would. Would love to hear from any UES PS33 parents about how their kids’ after school activities are and how often the bus messes things up. Is this a real issue or not?

One parent suggested 33 is downside protection in the sense that you aren’t as likely to run into parents with a different educational philosophy and you aren’t going to land an ICT class. Now I’ve had friends who told me they dreaded ICT and it turned out amazing when their kid landed in the ICT class. I have no idea how difficult an ICT class may be to manage in a worst case scenario. But one thing you generally know in G&T anywhere is you won’t have ICT.

02M033,Papifel,manhattan,Elementary,599,Hi! I am in he exact same situation. What have you decided? Were you able to get answers to your questions? I share most of them!,0,0,1,2019-07-18T14:49:28,1.0,0.063,0.172,0.038,0.495,0.192,0.429,0.23,0.182,0.295,0.19899999999999998,0.264
02M033,pick12lotto,manhattan,Elementary,599,"Hi there, congratulations to your kid on the G&T offer.  We chose PS33 G&T.

I may not address all the questions I laid out above, because the primary reason for our decision was something I didn't identify well in the initial post: teacher quality.  Of course, teachers are a huge part of what makes a good school, so it seems odd to have not zeroed in on them directly from the start.  Of course, teachers come and go, but it sounds like PS33 G&T has good teachers based on the program's build-out, and it has made good new hires over time.  Good teachers seems like an easier factor to be more confident in, rather than some of the other items in my initial post (many of which are ""driven"" -- at least in part -- by teacher quality, and many of which depend a lot on class composition, which obviously has many moving pieces [kids] in any given year).

All the parents at PS33 G&T consistently said very good things about the teacher quality there.  So once we focused on teachers, and since it's even harder to get a G&T slot in NYC after K (based on historical data, at least), we decided to try it.  The other major driver was focusing on the worst case scenario: K is a tough year (for whatever reason(s)), and we can't get back to PS6 for K (for whatever reason(s)), so we go back to PS6 for 1st grade.  That'd be a hard year... but it's also just a year.

What ""data"" did we have for this?  We were able to meet some teachers at PS33 G&T for short Q&As during the open house and at the school Carnival -- we liked them.  We weren't able to meet teachers at PS6.  That said, most of what we learned about both schools came from other parents' experiences, as relayed to us.

I'm emphatically <i>not</i> saying that I heard PS6 doesn't have plenty of good teachers.  Most parents I spoke with at PS6 said quite the opposite.  Relative to PS33 G&T, there was perhaps just a little more anecdotal ""well, this <i>one</i> year, I didn't love this <i>one</i> particular teacher.""  (I should again note that in some cases, even if the parent(s) didn't love a particular teacher, my recollection is they'd often add that their kid seemed to like the teacher in question just fine, and the comment was really about how the parent felt about his or her interactions with the teacher.  I think the chances of loving all your kids teachers aren't particularly great, no matter what school you're talking about -- it just seemed like we might have a little better odds at PS33 G&T.

There's also a pretty decent-sized UES population at PS33 G&T, which gave us comfort that 1) local playdates, while obviously not as easy to do as they would be at PS6, are a reasonable expectation, and 2) the odds of having carpool options for after-school pickups are greater.

The costs are clear -- the commute is long.  The benefits seemed somewhat intangible, but became more tangible when we focused on teacher quality.  The good news is both options are strong choices.

For whatever it's worth, I strongly suggest contacting Shannon, the incoming PS33 PTA president.  She's extremely helpful and can get you in touch with plenty of other families and you can ask whatever questions you like.  Best of luck with your decision.",0,0,2,2019-07-18T15:53:24,1.0,0.063,0.172,0.038,0.495,0.192,0.429,0.23,0.182,0.295,0.19899999999999998,0.264

I’d say the level of acceleration depends on the teacher and child. The curriculum is the standard curriculum, but many students go through it more quickly and work above grade-level. Children are separated into different math groups based on their level in third grade. Teachers work to challenge them based on their abilities. Both of my older boys are sufficiently challenged and happy. Chess is also very popular at 33, so it’s a great outlet for kids who want even more.

If she approaches prospective families to the school that way I can only imagine how lackadaisical she is regarding standards, accountability and overall school functioning. She was unable to answer questions regarding the inclusive classroom of G and T student ratio to General Ed. students and how that is handled within individual classrooms.

02M040,Meh,manhattan,Elementary,673,"The families and children are wonderful at this school; the community is friendly and supportive. The age of the building shows at times. The school is overcrowded, with kindergarten classrooms particularly small and cluttered for 25 5-6 year olds. Older classes are bigger, but the rooms are at least larger. The lunch room is as hot as a sauna on warmer days.

The curriculum and administration of the school is very traditional. The teachers and administration are nice, but not overly welcoming or friendly. Teachers and administrators are largely inflexible and not open to discussing alternative methods or other supports that your child may need. Thus, our experience has been that there is not a lot of space for teaching methods to be adapted for children who are alternative learners. Similar to other reviewers, I would say if you have an above average bright and motivated child she or he will thrive here; if your child has a learning disability or other special need, it's a challenge to get them the help that they need.  We went back and forth with teachers, the school psychologist and DOE for 6 months before we could get services approved for our child--even though it was well into the second half of the school year our child's teacher hadn't noticed their developmental delays

Just as a note, contrary to the review the school now has 2 pre-K classes, but nearly all pre-K students have older siblings at the school.

My child cannot spell on a third grade level, does not have proficiency in basic math applications such as 14-6, and lacks basic grammar skills. Perhaps the model of instruction set forth from Teacher's College is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and is leaving many of our children lacking basic skills in English Language Arts. I am suggesting, that is old-fashioned as it might seem, that our children begin to receive some of the basic skills that allowed our generation to be successful. Maybe we should bring back weekly spelling tests, drill and kill, basic math facts, and more guided reading lessons. I know I am not the only parent out there that shares these sentiments and suggesting that we get a dialogue going about the education our children are receiving at P.S. 40. At this point, I am very frustrated that my daughter writes two words during Writing Workshop and that seems to be OK with the teachers.

Over the years I have seen the math curriculum evolve for the better.  While TERC is used as an underpinning, I do feel that efficiency is being emphasized more strongly in each grade which is important, and that the school is doing a better job in educating parents about a math curriculum which is completely different from how we parents learned. This understanding has helped me accept and appreciate many elements of the math curriculum, and even view aspects as an improvement to when I was in school.

02M040,Concerned Dad,manhattan,Elementary,673,"My child is a recent grad of PS 40.  The school is, for the most part, a well-administered school that works hard to communicate with parents.  It also offers a very nurturing atmosphere and parents are very involved. There are some very good, dedicated teachers, as well as some mediocre and sub-par ones.  Overall, it is a solid school; however, there are two problems at PS 40 that also apply to all District 2 elementary schools.   

1. The TERC math curriculum (which is mandated throughout District 2) leaves much to be desired.  It is strong on ""strategizing"" different ways to solve a problem, but does not emphasize basic calculation skills.  As a result, students can do elaborate diagrams that relate to a math problem, but take an inordinate amount of time to execute simple calculations.  We saw this shortcoming and sent our child to an afterschool math program that taught her multiplication and division.  Finally, after complaints from parents, a slight adjustment was made to the TERC curriculum and ""math facts"" began to be emphasized (in other words, items like multiplication tables!!).  I won't forget when parents were instructed at the end of third grade to teach the multiplication tables to our children over the summer because they would need to know them in the fall.   Guess they realized that these ""math facts"" were important after all and it was on us to fix the deficit they created!   We were lucky because we had the resources to send our child to an afterschool program and she was ahead of the rest of the kids when they made the curriculum shift.  But more adjustments in the curriculum still need to be made.  

2. Spelling skills do not receive much attention.  In fact, my child had two teachers who could not spell -- one of them proudly/defiiantly announced to parents that she could not spell during the first open-class visit of the year!  We tried to address the curriculum's shortcoming at home and a fifth grade teacher also made an effort after she realized that her class couldn't spell.  But you can't win the battle when -- until your child's last year in elementary school --  the ""spelling is not all that important"" message is being communicated in class.  My child is an excellent reader and is becoming an excellent writer with poor spelling.  A recent conference with my child's middle school Language Arts teacher revealed that most of the teacher's students (who come exclusively from District 2 elementary schools) are poor spellers.  She also said that spelling is not part of the middle school curriculum and therefore she is not working on building spelling skills and is only grading papers based upon content, paragraph structure, etc.  So, once again,  we will need to address in-school shortcomings via private tutoring.  Even in the world of spell-check, spelling is an important skill and PS 40 and all the other District 2 elementary schools need to recognize this fact and address it.

PS 40 has a young dynamic faculty, which also includes enthusiastic veteran teachers. I don't know what one parent based her theory of 'potential for high turnover' on. Young teachers who go out on maternity leave come back to PS 40. There is a certain feeling to PS 40 that people aren't quick to leave. As for the comment that the PTA annual appeal donations are too steep ... PTA donations are not mandatory as in some schools. The PTA literature always seems to say 'give what you can...' The PTA is open to each and every parent/guardian at PS 40. The single parent who donates $25 is just much an equal member as the family who gets a matching corporate grant and gives a grand. It's true not all of us can afford the $400 the PTA asks for, but it is my belief that they understand and respect that. My friends with kids at 116, 234, and other public school all have annual appeals. These funds are used to support programs not funded by the Department of Education. It seems to me that the PTA is just trying to keep the halls alive with the sound of music. "" </P>
<P>A parent complains about the lack of communication with her child's teacher and with the principal and the inadequacy of TERC math and the writing curriculum. She writes that kids are not taught enough spelling or grammar. ""I find myself doing a lot of homeschooling."" She goes on to say, ""there are some marvelous young teachers but there is potential for high turnover. Kudos to the custodial staff! This is the cleanest, best-maintained, NYC public school I have ever seen."" She writes, ""The PTA also requests an annual donation that is beyond the reach of most single-parents such as myself. Basic school supplies are the responsibility of the parents. P40 is not without merit, but it is either over-rated or the majority of other public schools are grossly sub-standard."" </P>",0,0,0,2004-06-22T21:23:56,1.0,0.027000000000000003,0.174,0.006,0.113,0.01,0.076,0.126,0.016,0.141,0.62,0.083

I never had the need to get tutors or use Kumon for my kids and they both received 4s on the 4th grade math test. Also, the school just founded a math team for 4th and 5th graders, which both of my kids are enjoying, so there are certainly opportunities for math enrichment for those who desire it. My kids will be graduating this year, and we will always be grateful to PS41 for the amazing education they received.",0,0,0,2011-12-06T21:25:23,1.0,0.017,0.17800000000000002,0.003,0.086,0.003,0.055,0.073,0.016,0.09699999999999999,0.685,0.04

If a school accepts one twin, they are legally required to accept the other. Apparently, last year at 41 one twin was accepted at Battery Park City and the other at Baruch S.P. The parents wanted both kids at Battery Park City. Thus, the district head called up Battery Park City School and told them they had to accept other other child.

I also remember Ms. Kreuser (sp?) the Kindergarten teacher, Ms. Poirier in 6th and Mr. Cunningham in 4th. It was Mrs. Wordenschlag (sp.) in 1st grade who provided the magical moment when the light bulb went on and  I realized that I could read. In those days we didn't learn reading in Kindergarten, only in 1st grade. Who can forget wearing red ties with white middy blouses and blue skirts to Friday assemblies.

We picked this school immediately after a school tour out of all the schools we visited (include gift & talent programs) because we loved the building and had a very positive feeling about the teachers and staff here. And we were right- everyone CARES so much for the students in this school! Principal Lukas has been here only 2 years but she has made so many great improvements to the School and to the students's academic life. For examples- she knows every single student's name after a year(!); and that she brought in the STEM program to the entire school this year after parents raised the points that our school lacks a good STEM program in the past. Every teachers my kids have has been phenomenal -some were tough or old fashion but they just love and care so much for their students -you can just tell by the ways they interact with your children in and out of classes, or they make special effort to individual student who may a little attention or help. All the supporting staff, even the security guards, know and watch out for your children  in every corner of  this school so they are in a very safe and lovely environment.

02M051,T.D.,manhattan,Elementary,410,"We transferred to PS 51 from a local charter school when my girls were entering 4th and 2nd grades. It was the most terrifying decision I had made in a very long time.  I had one child with multiple learning disabilities although she was very bright and capable and both were struggling with their self-esteem. We had already gone through so many academic struggles that I wasn't sure if entering into a new academic environment would help or hurt. It turned out to be the best decision I could have made. I watched both of their self-esteems skyrocket. They were welcomed into the school like old friends and the teachers and administration were truly welcoming and supportive. The biggest up side for us was the numerous performing arts, STEM and other arts-based instructions that are embedded in the school day that finally gave my kids the balance they desperately needed vs. nonstop academic pressure. Today, my older one is flourishing thanks to amazing support from the SETTS teacher, guidance counselor and her teachers and my 3rd grader has really taken off academically and behaviorally and has an absolutely fabulous teacher. Coming from a highly structured, competitive academic environment, there are some very different academic approaches that took me time to get used to but once I spent time learning about their approach and the thought-process behind it I've been able to embrace it and really leverage the different learning programs. My now 5th grader earned 4s on all of her state exams last year which was very important to us for middle school applications. The principal is absolutely amazing. She is extremely present throughout the day, deeply involved in the curriculum, highly available to her teachers and parents and just genuinely and profoundly cares about the children at every level. The teachers are incredibly compassionate and work together to help children succeed and when there is need for discipline it is done with compassion and understanding while still achieving the needed disciplinary results. The school has done a terrific job of ramping up their communications, now incorporating weekly emails, texts when needed, regular updates on their FB page, an APP and most classroom teachers (I believe all but not sure) use the Remind App to communicate directly with parents which is phenomenal and was a goal of the PTA and principal last year. Finally, the PTA is wonderful and work incredibly hard to bring the ""extras"" to the schools that are actually part of the foundation that makes PS 51 what it is. Monthly PTA meetings where your feedback and suggestions are actually valued and incorporated whenever possible is fantastic and the principal, vice principal and parent coordinator actually attend the meetings, speak and take questions. PS  51 is an absolute gem of a school. While I don't regret our time in a charter school because of the choices we had at the time, if I had the choice of a school like PS 51 for Kindergarten, I wouldn't have even hesitated.",1,0,0,2020-01-22T14:27:17,1.0,0.085,0.259,0.037000000000000005,0.6579999999999999,0.254,0.561,0.11699999999999999,0.154,0.502,0.193,0.318

The recorder club, chorus club, science and coding clubs are also phenomenal.  They also have a rooftop garden.  Science classes use the space sometimes in their curriculum.

They work well with the Administration to ensure that our children experience excellent educational curriculum in a supportive environment. The needs of each child are valued.

The Science program has a great lab, and the Arts programs are top notch. Art and Music boast two of the best teachers in the City. In addition to a Physical Education teacher, they also have a dance teacher! I love the emphasis on the WHOLE child - academic enrichment and creative endeavors.

Now, let's talk about the facilities: Ten Stars! It's a new building, with a VERY protected play yard. Plus, there's a rooftop garden where the children get to plant and harvest. 

And the After School Care options? Loads. We participate in the program that uses the school building after school. That program brings in a reading specialist for those who are struggling, in addition to their programming which includes homework help, chess, tennis, art clubs, music lessons (violin and piano for my child), and so much more.

Today he is in the 4th grade and taking this years most important State evaluations, on which he scored all ""4s"" last year.  If he does the same, he should have his choice of Middle Schools next year.  We have added drum lessons to the continuing violin at home.

I was nervous as all his friends went elsewhere but I had such a good feeling about 51 that I stuck to my guns and I am thrilled that I did.

My son did so well in that class and excelled in all his subjects. I love that he gets an all round experience in this school ( social,emotional and educational ) with a lot of outstanding (and award winning)  art and music. However for those who worry about academics, he was reading two levels above his grade level by Spring and they always kept him challenged and excited about reading. He enjoyed 'shopping' for books in Grade2! He started K only knowing a few words so this was their doing with a little help from him :) They differentiate the teaching to an amazing standard so that there are always at least 3-4 different level groups in maths and English. Even the homework is differentiated and the kids come home with different homework packets depending on their own personal level. What I like most about this, is the children don't even realize they are in different leveled groups. There is none of this 'I'm in the top group' rubbish that we had as kids.

They had a lovely activity in K where a kids name was picked out of a hat, they got to sit in the special chair and their peers were encouraged to give them compliments about what they did well in class and/or for each other. Children are really encouraged to love and help each other at 51 and you can really feel that throughout the school. This is modeled so well by the staff who you can clearly see love their children and want the very best out of them.

You can see above what a wonderful review inside schools gave them, but they also have recently won many fantastic awards for which they so deserve.

Please take time to visit the school ( I went to at least 3 tours !). Try to also make one of the open house sessions, the next one is 22 December 2015. The teachers get to explain what they do and why and you can ask lots of questions.

I have had nothing but good experiences with the Principal and Vice Principal. They are very open and responsive to anything I have suggested which is a great plus for the school. 

I don't think anyone will tell you that their school is perfect, there is always room for improvement, but I know PS51 in my opinion is brilliant. I look forward to sending my 2nd child there next year.

Feel free to contact me to chat further.

The teachers have always been  available to talk about any concerns  that I have about academics,and have given me suggestions on what I can do at home to help him. My son is thriving at this school. We came from a school that the teachers did not want to communicate with parents at all. I had know idea how my son was doing at the other school until I got his report card. I was treated like a crazy overbearing mother for wanting to be involved with my sons education. P.S 51 is like a breath of fresh air.

If you want your child to be challenged or motivated to do work beyond the low expectations of the classroom, you should look elsewhere.

Students are engaged in a multitude of learning strategies to help them enjoy their work while challenging their abilities in order to move them to the next level. They are encouraged and supported in a warm and positive learning environment. Teachers are caring and approachable to their students and work diligently to approach difficult situations head-on with effective behavior management strategies. They differentiate lessons so that high-achieving students are challenged to utilize their talents to the fullest extent and lower-performing students get the appropriate support they deserve to achieve growth. All students train as artists and musicians and develop a multitude of techniques and skills throughout their 6 years at the school. All students study tap, ballet, music theater, and ballroom dancing through our many partnerships, and also participate in many exciting physical education activities during their daily recess period.

02M051,Rosalyn C Williams,manhattan,Elementary,410,"Review PS 51 Manhattan

Shame on me. I should have written this review long ago I didn’t because I am not the review writing type but someone has to let the world know about thie awesome jewel of a school. I hope and pray that my writing and experienc at PS 51 in manhattan can do it Justice and attract the right families to our community. 

We have been at PS 51 since Kindergaten. We chose this school after visiting all the pubic schools in our District and applying to ten private schools.

We are an African Amrican hetero married middle class family living in Hell’s Kitchen with only one child. We own a small business and are artistic. I believe in specifics so the reader might understand my POV.

We chose PS 51 over the other schools because it was more diverse and for its educational approach. I liked that there were several cultures celebrated in the school as well as discipline. I like to see kids walking in a line quietly. I am raising a black son and I want him to recognize times of learning and play as different. I need him to recognize and respect authority. Findimg the balance of his own power and strength and voice inside of the structure of the adult world is what I think is right for childhood. I find that at PS 51.

I am so proud of the development of his social skills that he got last year in special groups with the guidance councler. The compassion he developed brings tears to my eyes. This year he was invited onto the pier mediation team. Last year he got in trouble for some bad behavior that hurt other students. Can you imagine?! Now he’s so popular and involved. The teachers, staff, principal, my husband and I all worked together. It took a village. Here we are.

So the attention to Social development at PS 51 is outstanding even when your child is “I’m not perfect, Mommy” as he’s fond of saying.

As a side note,the kid who’s feelings he hurt so badly is one of his best friends now. They just came in last together in the 400 relay without tears or blame. I hope somebody out there can feel this journey.      

He also worked his way from special education to the top reading levels. From the CT class to no support at all. I am so proud.

I attribute the academic success to the emphasis on curriculum by the principal because she does not play, all the teachers are nose to the grindstone educators. Dedication to the concept of ‘family of learners’ is taken to heart. There is parent involvement & communication. We have workshops and support to help us, help our kids. It pays off, our kids are doing awesome look at our grades! And there are several languages spoken at PS 51.

Let’s talk arts partners and programs and computers. We have as many as the private schools. I know because we applied to 9 of them. We don’t have the sports teams, that’s it though, the only difference. Coleman involved in developing an iphone app using his recorder last year, after two days of working with the musicians and programmers he was on stage explaining to the adults how the app worked. Yes, We are wired for the 21st Century. In 3rd grade my son gave me a keynote for Chrismas. He also has he own (secret) website. Skills learned at PS 51. 

This year he’s learning to play guitar as well as continuing with the recorder and have signed Maurice continues in tap class. Yeah more programs too numerous to name. All spelled out on the PS 51 website.

I think the school is awesome because of the dedication of the staff, and teachers, led by the principal Nancy Sing-Bock. I hope that there will be more families that join us in our new state of the art building. 

Yes we have a brand-new library with $250,000 worth of books. A science lab. A rooftop playground, a ground-floor playground, I can’t name all the stuff that’s in there, you got to see it. Come for a tour.           ",4,0,0,2013-10-19T23:18:47,1.0,0.085,0.259,0.037000000000000005,0.6579999999999999,0.254,0.561,0.11699999999999999,0.154,0.502,0.193,0.318

I live across from your school and have noticed that the
lights in the building are frequently left on. They have been on in the first floor
since last Friday and they will, most likely, be on until Tuesday Jan 22nd.
That is four nights and four days of energy waste.

About 10 days ago I spoke to your building manager and
informed him that the lights in the whole building had been left on two nights
on a row that week and two nights on a row the previous week. Many instances of
lights being left on also happened during 2012. In fact, towards the end of the
year my wife was there in person to draw attention to that fact.

Each time I look out my window and see that waste of
energy I think of the   schools and citizens in the city that have not
yet recovered from damages brought upon by Storm Sandy and still lack
electricity. I find this hard to understand.

I trust this situation will be corrected and I thank you
in advance. Sincerely, Carlos Narvaez",1,0,0,2013-01-21T00:17:06,1.0,0.085,0.259,0.037000000000000005,0.6579999999999999,0.254,0.561,0.11699999999999999,0.154,0.502,0.193,0.318

I know that we have had teacher turnover over my seven years and our first principal left to become director of curriculum for The Bronxville School and the next principal left to become assistant superintendent of the Roslyn School District. 


I am not aware of any school without turnover. However, I know that it wasn’t until Principal Miller that our chess program received real support and she spearheaded girls in chess as well as Lower Lab Values to support our children’s social and emotional journey.

02M077,Anonymous,manhattan,Elementary,360,"I'd like to take this opportunity to correct some of the misinformation in the previous posts.  It pains me to see people who don't know much about their children's school and are not even involved in any way, but feel that they have the authority to speak on behalf of an entire parent body.  First of all, music is not provided to Lower Lab by the DOE.  Our PTA raises money through fundraisers, generosity of parents and affiliates, and parent volunteers who spend hours per week devoted to this school.  The current music teacher is currently in her second year and teaches orchestra, Chorus, recorder, and vocal music.  She is very impressive.  The previous music teacher WAS wonderful and was in the process of obtaining her PhD.  When she received it, she decided to work in academia.  It was not a surprise.  We were lucky to have her and we are lucky to have the current music teacher.  
The science teacher was 72 years old and had been at the school for over 30 years.  She actually delayed retirement because she loved the school so much, but ultimately decided to retire last year.  She has been replaced by a smart, enthusiastic, dynamic, and fresh new teacher who has connected with the students in just two weeks.  
I have had two students at this school and have been active here for six years.  My children each had a teacher who was new to the school in the past two years and received the highest level of education, compassion, and support.  They felt challenged, encouraged, and cared for.  Their friends are amazing and I, myself, have made close friends as a result.  Our families are terrific and our administration can't be beat.  Our Parent Coordinator, Gina Goodman, goes above and beyond in every way possible and is a true superstar.  Our Asst Principal, Denise Perez, is a true professional in every sense of the word and makes every student and parent feel comfortable and secure at Lower Lab.  Sandra Miller, in her fifth year as Principal, has made tremendous progress at Lower Lab.  She has implemented an entire curriculum based upon social-emotional learning, which has resulted in a true ""community"" feeling.  She has secured a new playground, new air-conditioning in the building, new windows, a refurbished facade outside the building, and a technology room full of robotics and computers.  That's a lot to accomplish in just four years.  
In terms of middle school placement, almost every student received their first or second choice in the past two years.  The ones who didn't continued on to gifted and talented programs within other middle schools and feel proud to have been accepted there.  
Students in grades 1-5 currently participate in Latin, with a seasoned, exciting teacher who will now provide continuity across five years at LL.

02M077,C.K.,manhattan,Elementary,360,"Our son will be graduating from Lower Lab in a couple of weeks and we wanted to take this opportunity to express our feelings about the school, its leadership, and its mandate to educate our children in both academics and life lessons. Our son has an IEP and arrived at Lower Lab beginning in 3rd grade after a difficult period in private school and a partial year at our zoned public school.  In the three years he has been there, he has struggled but is now leaving with friends, lesson skills, life skills, and the confidence to take on any challenges Middle School wishes to put in his path.  It is interesting for me to read some of the commentary about the Lower Lab Administration.  While not an active participant in school affairs, it is abundantly clear that the Administration - from Sandy Miller, Gina Perez, Gina Goodman to the individual home room teachers (Laura and Claudia in Grade 5) and specialist teachers (Josh and Mr. G) - has been nothing short of extraordinary.  After my children were born, I became interested in education and have developed strong convictions about the subject based on research, discussions and reflection.  For me, education is a combination of mastering the quantitative aspects of subjects (the fundamentals) with learning to appreciate the artistic qualities of life (lighting the fire that inspires a child to embark on one's individual journey of discovery).  There are no road maps to light that fire and it is unlikely that it will be the direction you would have chosen for your child.  One must let go and expose the child to a variety of subjects, to different cultures, to alternative ways to think about solving a problem - always watching closely, quietly encouraging, helping on those mid-course corrections.  At the end of the day, the child will follow his or her own path. It is essential that these early learning years be complemented by the teaching of values - the values that we encourage our children to follow.  Each morning after my mediation, I silently read my Affirmations; one of these is regarding my children - ""I must live the values that I want my children to embrace"".  There are no shortcuts here.  I have read several negative comments about the principal, Sandy Miller.   Each opinion is important and I respect people who disagree with me.  In my experience, any organization - whether it be a school, a business, a country, a family - is successful if there is strong and positive leadership at the top.  I believe that the success of Lower Lab has been a combination of 3 pillars - philosophy, personnel, and community.  Sandy Miller is at the top of the pyramid and while each brick is critical to the engineering success, she has been the architect - through her focus on learning to her adoption of the Lower Lab Values to her warm greetings to students every morning.  Our son has been the fortunate beneficiary of this extraordinary experience and we are forever thankful to each member of the Lower Lab team who worked so hard on behalf of our little one. In my dreams, each child would be given the opportunity to go to a school like Lower Lab.

We have had lots of different teachers -- the tried and true ""favorites"" and the brand-new fresh faces and have always been happy. While the state test scores speak for
themselves (our kids kick butt on these tests!), the teachers do NOT only teach for the test. The kids get an accelerated and varied education. They learn how
to become creative writers, critical thinkers, enthusiastic readers, scientists and mathematicians. Each class has a TA, which is great. 


The PTA is very active. They host events throughout the year (events in the main yard on weekends, movie nights, an auction, a Halloween party, a talent show and more). All of these events bring families together which is nice especially since our families are spread out over Manhattan. The PTA runs an afterschool program that is great too – offering chess, Mandarin, ice skating, football, basketball, robotics and more. 


Lab has great enrichments to add to the regular curriculum. In addition to Physical Education, Art, Music (Orchestra for 4th and 5th Grades), Technology and more, the younger kids study chess, architecture and bridges. The upper grades study creative writing and debate. National Dance Institute works with two of our grades for a great performance each year.  Fourth Grade works with a group called Wingspan to put on an original play about their Social Studies curriculum. Starting in the Fall, Grades 1-5 will take Latin (it is currently only for Grades 3-5). 


The administration is devoted to the students! That place is a well-oiled machine thanks to Gina Goodman, the parent coordinator.  She is the first person parents turn to with questions or concerns.  She has seen it ALL.  She is so encouraging to the kids in everything they do.  Mrs. Miller, the Principal, is finishing her 4th year at Lower Lab.  Her door is literally and figuratively always open. Families meet with her to discuss the middle school process, child-specific matters, etc.  She brought “Lower Lab Values” to the school a few years ago – every few weeks, she introduces a new “value” to the kids (respect, commitment, perseverance, etc.) and a new book that relates to the value.  The value is celebrated with a big all-school assembly! Mrs. Miller is always working towards what is best for the school and the students and you can tell she really loves them!  Ms. Perez, our Assistant Principal, is incredible!  As a former Lab teacher, she really knows the history of the school and knows exactly what Lab needs to do to stay on top. You can always find her meeting with the staff or speaking with parents – every school should be lucky enough to have this crew!

My time at lower lab was amazing and never dreadful as I made some of the friends I have kept and will continue to keep for life at this school. 

The teachers (however, many have left because of the most recent principal) are one of a kind and amazing at their jobs.  The level of education I received from their teachings were above none other. To this day I still see many on the street and never forget to say hello. All of my classes were memorable and fun and I never dreaded waking up in the morning to go see my friends.

Because of the small size of the school, there was no bullying and every single student was extremely close with one another. It was possible for me to go up to any student and start a conversation that could last an hour based off of how close everyone was to each other. Lower Lab showed me what a community means.

My time at lower lab was not under the leadership of Ms.Miller until my last year there in 2016. From what I have heard, the school has changed a lot. I feel the ""vibe"" of the school has changed a bit, but I am glad Gina Goodman can help keep the Lower Lab I remember in tact. 

I knew going into Middle School I wanted a diverse school with a strong community leading me to choose Yorkville East. Lower Lab prepared me to excel in middle School right off the bat as this trend has been followed by ALL my Lab friends who I am still very close with. 

Ive come back to this page to look back on my amazing years at Lab and decided to let people know why Lab is such an amazing place I called home.

02M077,anon student,manhattan,Elementary,360,"I agree that there is a lack of diversity within the G&T program as a former Lower Lab student, however some of your other claims seem to be a bit misinformed. 

The idea that the students of Lower Lab are only ""well prepped"" instead of having a gift in academics compared to other schools is wrong. The G&T exam tests natural intelligence which is something that anyone, no matter their race or wealth is entitled to. As stated in the other response by Josh Kirschner, the DOE gives practice books to any student for FREE. And this does not only apply to G&T, but to the SHSAT and other citywide testing programs. 

In the parent survey, 98% of PS 77 parents and 92% of PS 198 parents would recommend their respective schools, showing how overall the parents from both schools are satisfied with the education their child is receiving. At my middle school, two students in my homeroom are from PS 198 and were accepted into some of the the best high schools in New York City. They are also Hispanic, which is actually not the predominant race in PS 198. The school is 41% White and 31% Hispanic, which should not suggest anything about the wealth of the school or the students.

I would like to conclude by saying that comparing an elementary school to Apartheid is offensive.

Now yes, I learned almost nothing, never had homework, and regularly witnessed fights and drug use, but it was a fun 3 years. Instead of stressing over 2 hours of homework per night and constantly worrying about high school acceptances, I just lived my life. In my Algebra 1 class in 8th grade I spent the entire year getting up and talking to my friends during class and still passed the regents, like there really was no reason to be stressing constantly. I had a 99 average in 7th grade because almost everything was graded based on completion. There definitely was an adjustment that had to be made to my work ethic when I entered high school but I think it was worth it for not spending my middle school years as if I was a high schooler. There was a lot of diversity and something entertaining was always going on.

02M104,Parent Student P,manhattan,Middle,1116,"I attended Simon Baruch MS 104 from sixth grade to 8 months into seventh grade and got a transfer. I'm shocked at all the positive comments to say the least. 
I'm not the only student who feels this way but Simon Baruch MS 104 is absolutely one of the worst schools ever and will tarnish your child's middle school experience into pieces. I was sent to Simon Baruch as a zone school and let me say it's a zone school for a reason. There are two main issues with the school 1) the teachers and staff aren't attentive to students needs at all. If you're a student who needs any academic help or a student who suffers from special needs and you are in need of any type of guidance or extra help, you will not receive it from teachers and staff at Simon Baruch. I've never witnessed more unhappy teachers and staff than at Simon Baruch. They don't send positive learning vibes AT ALL. In the classrooms the learning experience is traumatic and horrific and like 9/10 of the classes. They have houses and in each house the SP class is probably the only okay class, meanwhile the other classes students leave the room without permission to cut class and talk to friends. Students get sexually harassed and bullied severely in classrooms and teachers are no help at all and as I said before not attentive. The classes are out of control and most students disrespect teachers and interrupt their peers ""learning experience"" and nothing is done about it. 2) the bullying and drama between students is so horrendous. People are sexually harnessed daily and also severely bullied. Again no action is ever taken to stop this and keep the safety of students. The guidance counselor is not help and actually participates in the rumors and dramas that go on. Teachers are childish and careless and are in charge to take care of the students who are children. Fights go on every week. Students beat each other up all the time. On Baruch property during the day and after school.
All in all, I'm glad I transferred wish I would've transferred earlier because I didn't learn anything at Baruch and got really bad grades because of being constantly rejected by teachers and peers when asked for help. Baruch isn't a good middle school and I would 10000% urge parents to look for other schools to put their children in. The learning is horrible at Baruch, so are the teachers and the students harassment is unreal. I really wouldn't know what I'd do if I were still there.

-there is bullying, it's middle school, what can you expect? But most kids were not bullied, it wasn't beating people up in school yard and more like excluding certain people and talk trash behind their backs 
-SP classes are honestly not that different from AP, I had friends from SP and the workload are pretty similar 
-the staff are amazing here, I worked with almost all of them and each cares so much, teachers pick favorites, again which teacher doesn't? 
-the Staff made high school application process a lot easier. First you choose the high schools you want and the teachers go over every single students application and give feedback on the application such as considering our grades and traveling distance when applying to this high school 
-the major flaw about the school seems to be bullying, and I have to be honest, in the three years, I witnessed plenty of fights in and out of school area but it was not like bullying, it was rather two friends fighting because they disagreed on certain things and the kids did get the punishments they deserve such as suspensions or even getting expelled. 
-also the major issue I had about this school is probably the fact that popular and pretty kids got more attention than the quiet ones and some teachers are pretty young and do not have control over the whole class

02M104,HappyMother,manhattan,Middle,1116,"I am the Happy Mother, I am not Baruch faculty and my daughter attended JHS104 as an SP student. The SP students and the Academic students get along very well and their workloads are equally comprehensive and they need to study and work hard to get the best grades.  SP students also struggle and believe it or not, they don't all get 99+ in their report cards. They need to maintain an 85 grade average or they get re-tracked to Academic. The teachers make these difficult decisions because sometimes. the Academic track is better and the students get the support needed so they succeed. All Baruch students have a good experience because the teachers make every effort to challenge their academic needs and meet expectations. This school is rated ""A"" and the Principal, Vice Principals, teachers, deans, parent coordinator, PTA and all administrative workers work very hard to make this school exceptional. They have a 97% attendance rate. The students want to attend school! They have a multitude of after school activities, sports and clubs and each child can choose to participate. The only way to make this school better is to stop the parents from whining about its shortfalls What??? if a teacher is remote, then go make an appointment to see he/ her.  Why don't you try to volunteer and check out what actually happens in the building. Better yet, why don't you speak to a Baruch student.  What is the big deal?? Bullying? Yes, it happens - just tell your child to deal with it the best way possible (most of these kids resolve their issues w/o parent interference) or if it's egregious, report it to the teacher or vice-principals or directly to Principal Gaetani.  These kids are trying to push the boundaries because they're teenagers.  My daughter was threatened and victimized in May 2014 and guess what - she worked it out, even when I offered to help. She said she could handle it. She's unscathed and no trauma ensued. There is no magical method. Parents need to be involved.

And do you think just because it's SP classes the students are sitting perfectly still in class w/o any distraction or behavioral issues??? These are KIDs and SP behavior is the same as Academic students' behavior. You should be thankful the teachers are all professionals and know how to handle 30 kids and not go berserk. 

To the parent who admits to be a former bully - did you bully 30 kids in the classroom at the same time? Did you form a gang of other bullies? Or were you just a rambunctious student who liked to fool around? Did you beat anyone up? Did you use bad language? Define your bullying. Because the deans haul in the student and parents to resolve these  quite expeditiously.

And stop complaining about a Principal who oversees over 1000 children on a daily basis. An active parent can be part of PTA or can volunteer for any of the several events the school offers and needs parental guidance to manage activities. If there's that one teacher who seems detached and distracted, then as a parent, don't wait until the end of the year to do something about it. Ask for a conference if it impacts your child's learning.

The Baruch students are just fine.  They're having a great time. They like going to this school.",0,1,0,2014-07-17T20:46:12,0.5,0.048,0.162,0.022000000000000002,0.41700000000000004,0.062,0.32299999999999995,0.348,0.075,0.177,0.35,0.094

02M104,HappyMother,manhattan,Middle,1116,"The teachers at Baruch Middle School 104 are the BEST: focused, efficient, organized, caring professionals who know what they're doing.  The students succeed because they have strong guidance & all resources available to them, necessary to do well in their classes.  The teachers are very firm in running their classrooms and are excellent disciplinarians.  If they seem too strict, it's only because they are trying to cover the intensive curriculums to prepare them for the next level and to succeed in standardized testing.  In addition, they are tasked with managing students' classroom behavior that pulls away from the time they need to cover material.  These highly competent teachers are expert in handling these adolescent hormone swings & behavior. The Principal is very well-respected, supportive & accessible when any issues are brought to her attention.  In my past experience, she quickly resolves problems and immediately communicated solutions, directly to me as the parent.  The Baruch students, are very social and form many groups within their own 'Houses' as well as other Houses and grades.  They are quite involved in academics and activities and develop many strong friendships.  Most will commute in groups & you can see them boarding the M15 buses on 2nd & 1st Avenues.  There will always be ribbing, gossiping, soap opera dramas and rambunctious shouting in this age group.  But the students are monitored quite well when they are on school grounds and they know the exact boundaries.  Many teachers proctor the halls & cafeteria to ensure a safe environment.  It is plausible and regrettable that the student who reported racism on this thread had a poor experience with teachers and other students.  My child is a minority and was able to integrate easily with the Black,  Asian, Hispanic and White students in this diverse school.  She also made strong connections to her teachers who were always available for assistance before and after school.  The teachers don't hand-hold the students - they are expected to know their subject, research their assignments, and to complete their work on a timely basis.  If your child is organized, focused and can be academically challenged, Baruch will give them a strong foundation and more, to continue their academics successfully and achieve their goals.  Its diversity alone and manageable school population, gives students a level view of the real New York and the necessary interactions needed to independently succeed on their own.

02M111,C.S.,manhattan,Elementary,365,"Just want to say that the Pre-K and G&T K have been excellent experiences at PS 111.

In Pre-K, my daughter learned a ton from a very experienced and knowledgeable teacher and teaching assistant, who were as warm and lovely as any ideal Pre-K teacher could be. My daughter had fun and loved going to school. Her classmates were a very diverse class--with friends whose parents ranged from professionals with a house outside of the city to friends whose families lived in hotels. But you'd never know. All the kids loved one another and their teachers. 

In G&T K, especially during this Covid-time, the teacher has been amazing in keeping up the curriculum and being as engaging and patient with the kids on vidchat. She's found the right balance to not overwhelm the parents with helping the kids do schoolwork too. Before Covid, she was awesome in her classroom--very innovative and fun, and determined to help each of her students excel. 

My daughter scored well on the G&T, and we explored 7 options: the 3 Manhattan citywides, LL (too far and seemed overcrowded and very similar to 111 in curriculum and facilities), PS 11 (smell of chlorine from the pool on the top level of the building, overcrowded computer classroom, imminent construction, and having to put her on a bus/commute on a subway to pick her up from aftercare and back home didn't make sense, the people at orientation seemed smug and cagey), PS 33 (parents seemed intense at orientation--the PTA volunteers got into a fight about who was supposed to be in a classroom during a specific time, seemed really segregated of all the schools, and overcrowded), and PS 111 (walkable to and from work, she knew all the specials teachers from being there for Pre-K, the specials had their own classrooms, it wasn't overcrowded, and the G&T wasn't overenrolled--she has a quite small class. I believe this has been the best advantage for still getting a quality education during Covid. She's friends with kids in her class and throughout the rest of K and her school, from knowing them from Pre-K and the excellent aftercare KING program. We also considered MTW/212, but it also seemed comparatively overcrowded. 

Anything deemed competitive (after the citywides) seemed unnecessary when there's a gem of a school right outside our door, almost literally. Principal Gilligan is engaged and fair. The PTA tries their best, and I feel like we were getting somewhere before Covid. The new parent coordinator seems very capable. The middle school hasn't bothered me or my daughter or her education. The facilities are spacious and are being updated or new. YOSL is free for all students starting in Pre-K and is an amazing music program. They have an excellent chess team.

Don't discount this school in your search. The kids in the G&T, I was told, all got into their first or second choice middle school. PS 111 provides a wonderful foundation to get your kid where they might want to go someday.",0,0,0,2020-05-15T12:49:22,0.75,0.11199999999999999,0.263,0.063,0.621,0.214,0.523,0.156,0.151,0.48200000000000004,0.18100000000000002,0.359

02M111,D.S.,manhattan,Elementary,365,"The main strength of PS 111 is its excellent teachers and staff. The principal is not. For last several years, he has gutted the G&T program by combining in one class those children who passed the G&T exam with children who did not. In his own discretion and without telling any parent about his grand plan, principal placed non-G&T children in G&T classes. A non-G&T child is usually on level with his/her grade; a G&T child is usually a grade or two above his/her grade level. As a result, the principal's action has led to non-G&T children feeling inadequate or ill-prepared in class - which is not fair to those children who are just as gifted and talented in their own ways. Because of the varying levels of skills, the G&T classes move a lot slower through the materials. As a result, G&T at PS 111 is not really G&T class as envisioned, as promoted, or as expected by parents who send their kids to test for G&T. Principal should have consulted with parents before doing a social experiment with our children.

02M111,S.F.,manhattan,Elementary,365,"Regarding the criticism that Principal Ed Gilligan has “socially engineered” the G&T program by placing general education students who are not “qualified” into the G&T program, I could not disagree more. 

I am a parent of two G&T students including one currently in 5th grade. My children have thrived at this economically, racially and culturally diverse school. Our experience with the teachers and administration has been very positive, including the wonderful principal Mr Gilligan. 

Mr. Gilligan has been proactive to improve the educational experience for all students. With support and funding from the PTA, he proposed and brought in a math trainer to improve the teaching effectiveness of all teachers in math. With input from the School Leadership Team (composed of parents elected by PTA, teachers and the principal), he introduced Mindful Meditation to help students focus and redirect their energy toward positive behavior and focusing on learning. He is always ready to meet parents in person to discuss concerns and try to address them.

Through his efforts, the school’s overall academic performance of all students has improved steadily since the start of his tenure. Another sign of his efforts starting to bear fruit is one third of the current 5th grade G&T has been invited by the highly selective city-wide G&T Anderson School (a K-8 school)  to take their 6th grade admissions test for 5-10 seats in September 2019. Only 500 applicants from across New York City schools who have high state test scores, report card grades, citizenship scores and strong attendance records are invited to take the test. We shall soon see how these students fared. However, it is a tribute to the school, teachers and Mr. Gilligan that such a new G&T program has such high performing students.

Over the past two years, Mr. Gilligan placed several students from the 4th and 5th grade general education classes into the corresponding G&T classes. The centralized DOE G&T admissions program only has testing for entry into K-3rd grades. The principal has the discretion to admit G&T in the later grades if there is room in the class. The current 5th grade G&T is nowhere near the capacity of 32 students.

He told us at a recent PTA meeting the students he moved from Gen Ed to G&T scored well on their state tests and have very good academic and behavioral records. As two of these students are or were in my older child’s 4th and 5th grade classes, I can attest through my time volunteering in class, as a chaperone during school trips and afterschool play dates that these students belong in G&T.  They have shown maturity, ability to focus, learn and contribute to the lessons and to get along with other classmates.

As an educator and leader, it would have been very easy for Mr Gilligan to avoid criticism by making the least effort and maintaining the status quo. But instead he wanted to give opportunities for high performing students to get grouped with similarly academically paced and engaged students. 

Ultimately, isn’t that the overall aim of education? To give each child the best chance for a quality education?",0,0,1,2019-01-24T02:06:46,0.75,0.11199999999999999,0.263,0.063,0.621,0.214,0.523,0.156,0.151,0.48200000000000004,0.18100000000000002,0.359

If a student comes from another G&T program in the city they can automatically be put in the G&T class.  He also said the schools can make a decision in 4th and 5th grade and they test any kid they think might be a good person for the G&T classes in 4th and 5th grade using reading and writing and math tests since there isn't a G&T test for those grades.  This doesn't seem like an experiment to me.  I agree with what anonymous said below about not all G&T students being able to keep up.

The G&T program that was created by the prior principal and the initial parents to the program will see the program be gutted into nonexistence as children from the regular program are inadequately prepared to take on the challenges and pace of G&T. G&T is there for a reason, to help children who perform above grade level thrive and be challenged. But if a child can't perform at above grade level, what is the point of the G&T program? Everyone will just end up being frurstrated.

But the one major concern is the principal. He does not inform families before a decision affecting an entire grade is made. Instead, the principal DOES like to social engineer the students without informing the families who are part of his experiments. If a child's confidence plummets because he or she can't keep up or the teacher is forced to slow down the pace to the detriment of everyone else, who is actually learning?

The DOE's plan to co-locate a middle school is an insult to students from both schools because a proper analysis wasn't conducted on how all the children will be affected. PS 111 didn't use to be a school of choice for families. In fact, my eldest wasn't even supposed to come here. But, after visiting the school under the prior principal and seeing the vision she had in building a G&T program and truncating the middle school, so that PS 111 will be an elementary school, we decided to lose our private school deposit and enroll our eldest here. We are glad to send our two children here and the current principal, Mr. Gilligan, is doing his best with continuing the vision of a PS 111 elementary school. However, the DOE is all about cost-saving without looking at what is in the best interest in the children. They are trying to pass a co-location proposal--to put an entire middle school on the 4th floor of the school--which I think is unfair to the middle schoolers, without laying out an analysis or specifics in how our gym, cafeteria, bathrooms, hallways, and one main entrance and exit will be shared. Plus, the children who will end up losing the most are the students receiving IEP (special needs students receiving therapy), because guess where they are receiving therapy right now? THE 4th FLOOR! With this co-location plan, these IEP children, which the DOE proposal doesn't mention, will end up in windowless basement rooms. 

Given that it is a new era and PS 111 parents will not lie down quietly while the co-location plan is being floated around by the DOE. a petition is circulating that I think all families looking at PS 111 must sign.

02M111,F.W.,manhattan,Elementary,365,"I am currently the PTA Co-President at PS 111.  I have been an active member of the PTA since my daughter started kindergarten in 2015.  I had many options for my daughter, including PS 212 and admission to several private schools.  I deliberately chose PS 111 after touring the school and meeting the parents and teachers on a school tour.  I was impressed by everything: the parents, the school and the vision the administration laid out for PS 111’s future.  

I now have two daughters at PS 111 and have experience with both the gifted/talented and general education programs.  PS 111 has been a wonderful school for my children and both are thriving, showing capabilities well above grade level.  No school is perfect, but my children are safe, happy and academically challenged at PS 111.  The school community is incredibly welcoming and supportive to my children and my husband and I as parents.  My children’s teachers have been and are incredible in terms of their true dedication to learning and their partnership with my husband and I as parents.  This is no less true of the school administration, including Principal Gilligan, Principal Harvey, Zaida Cosme (the parent coordinator) and all of the other school aides and personnel.

The same holds true for the PTA.  I accepted the challenge of being PTA Co-President because I was truly inspired by all the hard work done by the PTA in just a few short years.  In four years this PTA has grown its membership, fund-raising efforts and support given to the school.  There have been a significant number of improvements made to the school that have been led and funded by the PTA, including air conditioning, a new sound system for the auditorium, a completely renovated teacher’s lounge and dance classes for the students, to name a few.  Due to the efforts of the PTA we have been able to fund a significant math training program for the school’s teachers this year.  This sizable effort will only benefit our children, who are already fulfilling the promise of the school with a nice increase in the math and ELA state scores for the school  (yeah! go students!).

I understand that there are many parents who are upset at the idea of a colocation.  To the extent that the PTA can make sure that those parents have information about the proposed plan and give them a forum to express discontent we will certainly do so.  Currently, the PTA is not aware of any additional information about the proposal other than it is being discussed by the DOE.  While we all wish dearly that the DOE would provide us with more, they follow their own rules and regulations and are not governed by the wishes of the parents.  I understand that the lack of information from the DOE has been frustrating for every parent and I encourage parents to reach out to the District Superintendant and anyone else at the DOE to make their frustration known.

But I hope that we can refrain from turning our frustration on one another, whether it is the PTA or other parents who simply don’t agree with an opinion.  As an important reminder, every parent and guardian of PS 111 is a member of the PTA.  While there are 6 elected Board Members, we are *not* the PTA.  All the parents of PS 111 are.  However, it is true that as elected Board Members, we take on the lion’s share of the responsibility for keeping the organization up and running.  We do so because we believe in our school, children, parents and community.  There is no colocation which can change that.  As a PTA we are truly stronger together, but in doing so we must recognize and honor the diversity of our experiences, voices and opinions.  We must do this on easy issues and it is more important to do so on harder issues like colocation.  

It is truly unfortunate if parents decide that they will not support the children of PS 111 unless the PTA and all other parents agree with their opinion.  I, personally, will be working as hard as I can at all upcoming fundraising events for our school and children.  And when more information becomes available I will assess and make an informed decision about the merits of colocation.  I will attend every public hearing and make my opinion known.  I invite every parent at PS 111 to join me in this.

Of course, I welcome your comments but please, let’s keep it civil.  There is so much that has happened today which is likely the result of public incivility (among other things to be sure).  I simply want to do the best I can for the school and its children.

02M111,X.1.,manhattan,Elementary,365,Why help the “PTA” ? If you are a parent in this school you are a PTA member. Why help “yourself” are you asking ? Many dedicated PTA members who want to help “themselves” are investing their time and money to help the school where YOUR kid is spending the majority of his/her time.  THAT'S WHY. The co-location is a concerning issue that impacts many schools in the city and it has a much broader impact than just PS111.  Educate yourself parents and fight responsibly.

PS 111 used to have a middle school, which was phased out by the prior principal because of its troubled past and it wasn't creating a safe environment for the elementary school kids (if you read the comments from that time period, it is telling). So why would the DOE decide to put another middle school in there? It seems like the school as an elementary school is on the upturn and there is progress. But if City Knolls ends up in our school, all that progress and effort into phasing out the middle school was wasted. Elementary and middle school kids need separate schools, and it doesn't help in this situation that they will share the same entrance and facilities.

So if anyone has more news about co-locating a middle school or City Knolls, please share.

Another con is that most (not all) teachers just go to do their job and that's all.

The PRO to this is that there are some great teachers like one of my son's 4th grade teachers that care but it's too much for only one teach er to handle. Another pro I will say is that I LOVE the counselors, the parent coordinator a couple PTA parents and the guards. Honestly, these people I speak of are awesome!

The school is only as good as its parent body so parents need to keep nudging the very busy principal to implement improvements. There are certain decisions that the principal often takes without consulting the parents, so he ends up backtracking on the decision. For example, without consulting parents, he simply eliminated cap and gown for 5th grade stepping up ceremony. He also eliminated the practice of having teachers at the school yard in the morning to greet the kids as they line up with their classmates -- which was a practice that parents find welcoming and comforting. No discussion was had - just a radical change without even prior notice. The principal is busy no doubt but parents need to  feel consulted and respected so there has to be a balance. Parents need to feel their voices are heard. PTA meetings are great but many of us can't go to PTA meetings because of work, and PTA meetings are driven by PTA officers mostly and not the general body parents.

At lunch and recess, staff fails to supervise children. Some staffers (and not all) are often standing around talking with each other while K and younger kids are left to their devices. Staff needs to be trained (or told) to not be standing together and being dispersed throughout the yard to supervise the kids. There's also a big second grade G&T class (28 kids) with just one teacher. That's unheard of in this school and the principal thinks 111 is still lucky because other schools have over 30 per class. Well, that's nice but that's not why parents came to G&T at 111. The school is also pretty full because of the public charter school on the 4th floor. While there is harmony between the schools, the 111 kids have had to reduce gym time and yard time because it's now shared with the public charter.

The administration has been very engaging in getting parents involved. using the limited resources they have. The principal and admin have gone above and beyond in making sure our children are constantly challenged. Our concerns about materials or teaching techniques are always answered in an effective and timely manner. We seriously thought about homeschooling our children before choosing PS 111.

With small classes and individualized instruction, our children have been consistently challenged academically by the teachers. I would even go as far to say it is even better than private school. As a native NYer, I am a product of NYC public and private schools so I am in the unique position of experiencing both and can make a comparison. I don't know any other school or G&T program that has a Math teacher that provides 1x1 instruction for our child because they are in a higher math level than their peers. The school has been doing their best in bringing the best teachers into the school who not only challenge our children, but have empathy and the passion to teach. 

This school is definitely a work in progress, but as the neighborhood becomes more gentrified, I am hoping that more parents send their children to this wonderful school and become involved in the PTA. Like other schools, we cannot improve without the efforts of all the parents. 

I encourage all families who are deciding whether to enroll their children here to walk into the school and ask for a tour. The door is always open.

Yes, unfortunately there is only one PC who was out for 4 days - so if you are anxious to find out info, contact the Principal. However, when school resumes the PC will be back. FYI, A good time to head to the main office is after 8:45am or before 2:30pm - those times are really busy. However, the office staff are accommodating when you enter the office - granted patience may be required.  
Just my thoughts (2yrs there) about the school - Principal Gilligan values equity which is demonstrated in his words and actions, there is a very low turn over of school staff AND there are areas that need improvement. You seemed to have picked up the issue with communication and organization - which is being worked on, but change is not quick. As for Krispy Kreme - if you compare 111 there will always be pro's and con's and if you decide to come to 111 you can advocate for change by being part of the board of the PTA / attend the meetings as the KK fundraiser came from the PTA - and where $ would come from for a wellness chef. 
My last thoughts are PS 111 is not for everyone - there is STILL change happening and given the vast diversity of students who attend PS 111 - this school needs parents who understand this, who support the changes and who will advocate for ALL of the children, not just their own b/c they have more disposable income or the time to be (or value) involvement.

Also, I understand your assertion that parents should be advocating for ALL children but that is impossible when there are so many interests, each individualized. Coming from a pre-school where there was heavy involvement from all parents, it was nice to be part of a community that supported each other and shared in responsibility. I hesitate to go to a school where that is inequitable. 
The fact of the matter is, the majority of G&T students come from families that are somewhat aware or involved in the education of their children (hence, preparing, registering and taking the test in the first place) and these families tend to have, at least limited, disposable income. Not just at PS111, not just in NYC, but all over. The statistics on this are solid. These families also tend to ask more questions, expect more answers and have a heavier hand in the day-to-day education of their children. This is a good thing.

I think your response makes a lot of assumptions and at the same time, a good point. You might be right that PS111 is not for us. Each child is an individual and has specific and sometimes unique strengths and weaknesses. There is never a one size fits all solution, as you indicated. If one child is strong in debate and another in dance but one program has to be edited then I would expect the parents for each would advocate in their child's best interest, and should. I'm sure as a parent of a child in the IEP, you would certainly support and fight for that program more than a parent who has no involvement, naturally. 
For you to actually state that I (or anyone, for that matter) think it's in the best interest of the school to advocate for just the financially privileged, is widely off-base.

After re-reading this thread, I think Maria may have misunderstood your previous comment in regards to advocating for one group over another.  However, I did want to note that this school does it's best to provide an individualized education plan for each student. For example, my (G&T) child is strong in math, so they moved him during his math period to the gifted class two grades up in order to provide him with teaching that is on par with his ability.  I really wouldn't classify our school as ""teaching to the middle"" and I agree that this doesn't work. I likely wouldn't still be at this school if that was how they approached things. So far I've been very happy with the accommodations this school has made in order to provide quality teaching at a stimulating level for my child.

I just wanted to provide a little information for District 2 families who might be applying to East Side Middle for 6th-grade admissions. My child, a general-education student, received a 391 out of 400 on the school's rubric (he scored 4s on the state tests--4.09, 4.11--but he would have needed 4.5s to have gotten 400). He wasn't offered a seat, and he is currently 66th on the school's waitlist. Obviously, he won't be going to ESM, as there are only about 150 seats, with an unknown portion reserved for ICT students and 17% reserved for students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.

As our family went through the process of applying to middle school, we were sometimes thrilled by what we saw as we toured schools and listened to presentations.

02M114,C.W.,manhattan,Middle,451,"Went to their last middle school “tour” back in late November. The school is in a beautiful new building that they moved into in 2010. 

A few things struck me:

1. Unlike the other middle schools’ tours, they offered “tours” on three different evenings with specific District 2 schools designated on each night. So my son’s school was only slotted for the third and last “tour” date.  I don’t understand why they didn’t allow flexibility for students and families to choose from 3 dates.

2. There was actually no tour. We all gathered in the cafeteria (they don’t have an auditorium) where they showed a video of still photos of students and teachers in classrooms, corridors, cafeteria and in the yard. The principal spoke about the school as did the newly minted assistant principal who was a math teacher previously. There were 8 eighth-graders, a mix of boys and girls who shared their experiences and tips for the prospective students in the audience of about 200 people. 

I was very disappointed that parents who took time out of their busy schedules weren’t allowed to see the classrooms and other facilities of the very modern building.

3. The 8 eight-graders who spoke were an inspiration. Each had his or her own style but you can see their pride and love of their school. Interestingly though, in contrast to their diverse audience of black, Hispanic, Asian and white families, all the eighth graders were white.

Perhaps their minority students couldn’t take part because they had to study for exams, had personal commitments or were just plain out sick that day. The optics, however, in light of ESMS’ longtime reputation, deserved or not, as a school of privileged rich white Upper East Side kids, were jarring. 

To their credit, the principal talked about their sister school in Kenya with whom they have an annual video conference (yes once a year if I didn't misunderstand). He also said they will set aside 17% of their seats for low income students. 

However, he never touched on why all their student representatives were white. In an era where diversity and equity are at the center of the DOE’s and mayor’s radar, I found it hard to believe the principal isn’t aware of how it would come across to the audience.",0,0,0,2019-02-12T02:01:23,0.75,0.0,0.16899999999999998,0.002,0.131,0.002,0.086,0.14,0.028999999999999998,0.11800000000000001,0.6409999999999999,0.013000000000000001
02M114,Esms Admissions,manhattan,Middle,451,"Although this post is from over a year ago, we would like to respond to several inaccuracies that C.W. has posted for the benefit of our future applicants.

1. ESMS has never offered tours. We have ""Open House Information Sessions"". Each year, we offer SIX Open Houses (2019 dates: October 2, 16, 23, 30, Nov. 13, 20) not “three” as C.W. stated.  We also hold an additional information session for parents of ICT students.  We do allow some flexibility and offer parents the option to contact us if the date assigned to their elementary school does not work for them. The open house dates are posted on our website and the DOE website at the beginning of the school year. For families that cannot attend an open house, we always participate in the District 2 Middle School Fair in October.  At this event, ESMS administration and  current and former student volunteers distribute information to prospective families and address their questions.
We do not give tours of the building.  We have over 2,000 parents and children each year that are interested in visiting our school and find tours of empty classrooms to be unproductive. We feel it is a far better use of everyone's time to have the faculty and students talk about our school philosophy and culture and to answer questions.

2. We are pleased that you found our student speakers “inspirational” (we do too)! We ideally would like to have a diverse group of speakers as well, however, as you said yourself, students have after school commitments and cannot always return to school in the evening. We have many students volunteering for the Open Houses and we try to give all our volunteers a chance to participate. The students selected for each open house are based on their availability that particular week.

3.  Our Skype Kenya program with our sister school, the Red Rose School in Kibera, Kenya, is a weekly program, not an “annual video conference” as CW stated. We Skype every Friday at 8 am (posted on our school calendar). We have been Skyping with our Red Rose pen pals for 10 years. 

4.  We participate in the Diversity Initiative in cooperation with the DOE. Eligibility is based on families that qualify for free or reduced price lunch. We have no access to this information for our applicants. The DOE sends the offers directly to the students that qualify for admission under this initiative. 

5.  We do not consider an applicant's ethnicity, gender or current school when ranking students and there is no priority given to siblings. Our admissions rubric is clearly outlined on our school website as well as the DOE website. Applicants must live in District 2, or attend a D2 elementary school, and meet our attendance requirements. The only data we consider - 4th grade final grades and 4th grade standardized test scores - is provided to us directly by the DOE. We score applicants and rank them from highest to lowest score based on this data. Our ranking procedures are approved and overseen by the DOE Office of Middle School Enrollment. We do not accept, or consider, additional information such as letters of recommendation or extra-curricular activities.  

Parents interested in East Side Middle School should attend an Open House in the fall and are always welcome to contact us with questions regarding admissions.",0,0,1,2020-02-28T15:44:53,0.75,0.0,0.16899999999999998,0.002,0.131,0.002,0.086,0.14,0.028999999999999998,0.11800000000000001,0.6409999999999999,0.013000000000000001

02M114,Esms Admissions,manhattan,Middle,451,"While we at East Side Middle School agree with you that parents should do their research before applying to middle school, there is some misinformation in the comment you posted that we would like to address.  

East Side Middle accepts students from all over District 2. This year, in addition to the uptown schools you mentioned, ESMS accepted students from PS 124, PS 3, PS 116, PS 11, PS 33, PS 41, PS 217, PS 234 and PS 442 – all located in midtown or downtown.  
 
Each fall, we contact all D2 principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors and parent coordinators, and invite their students to open house information sessions. We would love to have more applicants from midtown and downtown, and we strongly encourage them to have their students apply. As we are sure you realize, many parents want their children to attend school close to home. That is the primary reason that our applicant pool and admits are predominately UES students.
 
Our admissions rubric must be approved and is overseen by the DOE.  During the ESMS application process, a student’s elementary school has absolutely NO bearing on the application.  Placement offers are based solely on a student’s total score per our rubric. At the time of our in-house interview and assessment, we do not look at or consider the student’s elementary school, something you may confirm with the District 2 Office.",1,0,1,2018-05-09T16:56:37,0.75,0.0,0.16899999999999998,0.002,0.131,0.002,0.086,0.14,0.028999999999999998,0.11800000000000001,0.6409999999999999,0.013000000000000001

All you are given is a rude look from the security guard. Also, this school is full of kids with way too much privilege and the kids know it.

The academics as I said, are not what I expected. I heard that this was the best middle school and it will be great and it will challenge you so much, but what I got was a crappy education from crappy teachers. I cannot think of a single teacher that I like (except for one who isn't even my teacher). Our math teacher and science teacher is rude to every student and barely encourage growth as a student.

Our school has managed to maintain a strong reputation over the years with extremely intellectual students and a skilled staff. Predictably, we live up to our expectations both in terms of the quality of education and the quality of our community. The administration is always trying their best to make the students feel warmly welcomed throughout the entire year. What other principal stands outside in rain or shine every morning to greet their students? In my three years here, there has never been a dull day. Even if I had been feeling down, my teachers never failed to notice, and when they did, they immediately took action. Our teachers are not just good for academia, but they are extremely kind and trustworthy if you need to talk to someone. Alongside being a friend, they prepare us exceptionally well for the future... Which leads me to high school. I graduated from East Side Middle this past June with an acceptance into both a specialized and non-specialized high school, which is a big opportunity for kids my age. Personally, I think that without the remarkable education system I completed at ESMS, I would not have been granted acceptance into such wonderful high school programs. At this school, we are treated like grown-ups which prompts us to develop independence. This quality is especially important for high school as we begin the transition into adulthood. Overall, Mr. Getz and Mr. Colon have done an amazing job keeping the school intact by providing the students with the ultimate facilities they need to become strong and powerful leaders.

At ESMS writing assignments were minimal, kids were left to websites to choose pop junk books, a major humanities assignment involved 2 books that were 2  years below grade level. She has regressed in reading, vocabulary, and writing and isn't interested in reading anymore. Teachers did not comment on sufficiently or consistently help her to correct her grammatical errors.

02M114,Directexam,manhattan,Middle,451,"I'm an 8th grader at this school and I'm going to give a
harsh review of the school. First and foremost I think this is a great school
but not without flaws. I'm going to start with the flaws. Yes the science in
7th and 8th grade is very bad. This is not the teachers fault as feel they are
great but it is the curriculum and the annoying timers for everything that you
do. As far as I know this is only for the eighth grade but I really have no
clue. Also worth noting is that lunch for 6th and 7th grade is at 11:45. It
used to be that all 3 grades shared a lunch but now only 6th and 7th grade
share a lunch. 2 more flaws before I talk about what I like. 1 some of the
teachers have open favorites and 2 the security guard is scary for a while. It
could just by me shy personality but I think this school has a good deal of
cliques.


Now I get to be positive. 
For starters Mr.Getz and Goldspeil do a great job making the school feel
like a community by greeting everyone by first name as they enter which might
seem small but is nice way to start the day. Another thing that I love is that
school starts at nine so we can get more sleep which is greatly appreciated. At
this school the teachers for the most part will expect effort and when you
actually the effort in a bunch of them show their true colors as truly standout
teachers. The workload is very tolerable if you put your head down (usually I
don't)


All in all the teachers are great and the staff works hard
to know everyone and the teachers offer to reach a hand out but if you don't
take it don't expect pity.

Yes, i agree that the science curriculum in the 7th and 8th grade is weak. However the 6th grade science is phenomenal.  I have one of the highest averages in my class and I am still challenged.  That is NOT an issue.  ESMS is a very competitive environment.  Not so much as from the teachers but from the other students.  It is hard if you are not very strong in school.  Some people can get left behind.  But overall most kids are obsessed with getting over a 95.  But we have many amazing teachers.
these teachers in my opinion are the best.-but the ones with stars next to their names knock it out of the ball parkscience-Ms.Cabrera*-Ms.Grippomath-Ms. Chin-Mr.Cesa*-Mr.Finchhumanities-Mr.Klein-Mr.Feder*-Mr.Lyons*-Ms.Blalockspanish-Ms.Denneroff*-Ms.StellaArt-Ms.MainhartP.E.-Mr.Denneroff*Guidance-Jessica*All the teachers are extremely dedicated to their students.  They work extremely hard and take time out of their lunches to provide extra help.  Some teachers do extra classs outside of school(not necessarily extra help).  We are one giant family.  One teacher is openly gay and just got married.(name not disclosed for the privacy of the teacher).  Noone cares. Everyone knows the staff(from office workers to janitors) by name.  And every grade has intensives or advisories(bullying, technology, book club, time management, etc.) once a 4th period on tuesdays.At ESMS we have an extremely supporitive environment.  We have strong anti-bully system.  We have electives every Thursday.  Electives are fun classes we would not get to have otherwise

02M116,erica rand silverman,manhattan,Elementary,450,"My sons are in pre-k and 1st grade and we've had a wonderful experience so far. Our teachers have been fantastic. Our current Pre-K teacher takes the Reggio Emilia approach to her teaching (meeting the students where they are at, allowing them to drive the content of the curriculum based on common interests, etc).  My first grader loves the specialties - music and performing arts especially - and can't wait to learn to read music next year in second grade.  He's also become a chess player because of 116. I appreciate how involved the families are.  There is a wonderful group called Parents for the Arts who feel as passionately as I do and are committed to making sure our children are exposed to an engaging and dynamic art curriculum. Personally, one of the reasons I wanted to be in 116 over the River School was because of their decision to adopt PDF (Playtime, Downtime, Family Time) in lieu of homework.  My first grader reads every night (I can't get him to stop), fills out his reading log and makes smart choices for his PDF.  He is reading above grade level and enjoys doing math activities at night (by choice).  The school has woven SEL/mindfulness (the importance of breathing, meditation, etc) into all their classes.  The principal hosted a PD last week for thirty other AP's to teach how to do it successfully.  Overall, it feels great to be a part of such a warm, diverse, community and to know that the administration and teaching staff are committed to creating a school that values process, play, and internal well being as much as academics.",0,0,0,2017-12-11T21:24:44,1.0,0.055999999999999994,0.187,0.006999999999999999,0.37799999999999995,0.138,0.271,0.21600000000000003,0.1,0.209,0.418,0.147
02M116,Gilberte Lal,manhattan,Elementary,450,"As a parent of a PreK student, I can only say that we have been very pleased with the school.  The PreK teachers and aides are excellent.  My daughter has changed in a positive way so quickly - she has learned routines, talks about being a scientist, has become more independent and taking more responsibilities to be helpful.  She was always good at home, but has now shown a greater maturity in her thinking and behavior.  I am impressed every time I go to ""buddy day"" and see how she is learning through experience to write her name or read.  The PreK teacher also posts class photos and videos to a blog for parents to update us on activities.  Parents are also encouraged to come to class to teach lessons - I went in Fall to teach her classmates about Divali, a Hindu holiday.
I've seen that there is a strong group of parents that are part of the PTA and you can make a difference if you get involved.  The leadership team has been available and I feel informed about what is happening at the school through emails, PTA, and the website. I even emailed the Principal on a weekend with some concerns and she replied immediately! I feel that it is what you want to make of it - if you get involved and talk to teachers, parents and staff you can make the school part of your community and hopefully a better place for everyone.  I am excited to continue in the school as I learn about amazing programs being offered - such as a partnership with Studio in a School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Ballroom Dancing lessons, and chess & running clubs. There are many community building events and great opportunities to participate in the school as a parent. Yes, this is a public school and there is always a need for funding.

Anyway - for our family this is a GREAT school - with GREAT values.  One of my favorites is the peer mediation program that lets kids help each other solve problems...also check out the beautiful school yard and soon to be renovated gym.

I finally buckled down (don't ask me why it took so long) and taught her how to do division by rote so she can deal with division of large numbers---because I was amazed to find that she still has trouble and takes too long to do division, thus screwing up her chances of finishing tests with complex word problems. This is a student who is actually good at math overall and learned what I taught her in about 15 minutes, much to her relief.  I've posted a similar message twice and it keeps disappearing.

02M116,Madamemoine,manhattan,Elementary,450,"In response to the budget questions, a financial review is included in every PTA meeting and clearly delineates where the monies raised are spent. Furthermore, the breakdown of expenses was printed in the first newsletter of the year since it is such an issue due to the budget cuts. All this information is also available on the school's website. 6% of the budget is allotted to teacher development so it does not represent a significant expense overall.

Having the playground redone in the fall is a major inconvenience to all the children (& parents at drop off/pick up) however the finished product will be a major asset to the children and as another parent already mentioned, the poor timing can be blamed on the School construction authority.

There are 20 parents who serve on the PTA and we are only zombies when it is boo bash. We manage to organize well over 20 events throughout the year and raise over $400,000 to support the school's programs.We have also many parent volunteers who donate their time (not just money). Without their help and a PTA board to coordinate, PS 116 would certainly not be as special of a school.

Overcrowding is a concern indeed and one which affects NYC as a whole.  Due to the concerted efforts of a few people 2 weeks ago, kindergarten classes were capped off at 26.

If you want your voice heard, attend PTA meetings - the next one is at 6:30pm on October 19 as it is every other month in order to accommodate working parents.

02M116,Momof2ndGraderatPS116,manhattan,Elementary,450,"PS 116 is a great neighborhood school - an often overlooked gem in Manhattan.  My child has been there since kindergarten and is now entering 2nd grade.  The PTA is strong and a lot of parents give a lot of money so the school can continue have extras in the face of budget cuts.  For example the PTA funds teaching assistants for K and first grade and now 2nd grade.  

The teachers are great and the instruction is very structured and effective.  The focus (in the first 2 grades at least) is very much on reading level, basic writing, and counting and math.  All the kids no matter the level they enter at seem to progress significantly in these skills over the year.  

Other great things about the school:  Diversity of nations - many UN families attend PS 116 so children from many countries are part of the community - natives of China, Japan, Africa, Middle East, are among the classmates of my child. 
The special classes  are very good - they have wonderful art and music and science teachers who've been at the school a long time and all the kids love. However, due to crowding these specials are only 1/2 the year for most kids (except science)   Other specials include Library, computer, gym, classroom chess, (run by NYChess Kids) and Lincoln Center - a performing and visual arts unit run by Lincoln Center.  In Lincoln Center my child has had a unit on Dance, Blue Grass Music, Visual arts.

Yes, there are problems with overcrowding but that's happening everywhere and so far it hasn't impacted my child's learning n too much.  However, the budget cuts hit hard this year and 5 (not 6 as mentioned below) 2nd grades had to be combined into 4 with an estimated 29 kids per class.  This was a big shock because in first grade last year most classes had around 20 students- an amazing gift! Also one of the gym teachers was let go.I can't imagine why all these people complain so much about Ms. Jane (not Katherine) Hsu.  She seems very nice, attends every PTA meeting, and is very visible day-to-day in the yard and in the classrooms.  She communicated to the parents regularly.  She worked this year with the local police precinct to get crossing guards added at 2 places near the school.  I suppose you can criticize her choices of what to cut, but in my opinion -it does not seem that there is any fat in the budget, so what ever you choose to cut is going to hurt. This a great option for NYC families not opting for private.  Don't let the carping below fool you.  ",5,0,0,2011-09-07T18:12:03,1.0,0.055999999999999994,0.187,0.006999999999999999,0.37799999999999995,0.138,0.271,0.21600000000000003,0.1,0.209,0.418,0.147

Both our children love their gym, music and art teachers.  There's a brand new school library with a very helpful librarian.  Our older child loves his science teacher.  There's a chess program, also with very caring chess teachers.  The kids can join band and other athletic teams from 4th grade I believe.

Last year, a majority of our class's parents inquired with administration about the child-to-class assignment process.  We did so after finding out that parents from the other class lobbied to the principal to be assigned the more experienced teacher. 

We sent in a long letter with a majority of the class parents signatures to get a response of ""See you in September"" from the principal himself.  We requested for another meeting to get the response of ""I do not think there is anything more to talk about"".  Administration also promised that they would make sure that the two TAG classes run on the same pace. 

The two classes are completely off pace from each other.  The workload and output of the other TAG class is what we expect from a blue ribbon school.  The workload and output of our TAG class is what they were able to produce in their 3rd grade TAG class.  Not only this, we have 32 kids in our class while the other class has 28.

02M130,Insideschools,manhattan,Elementary,823,"A comment from POPPYNYC:

Having just finished up our final year at PS 130, I thought it was a good time to post a review on InsideSchools. The website has been a
valuable tool for our family in the past (elementary, middle) and now as we begin our high schools search.  So, I thought best to post here and give back some. The DOE handbooks really don’t offer enough color to get the vibe of a school so I really like supporting websites like this.

Anyway, we put two kids through PS 130, in their TAG program, with our youngest graduating in 2017.  We couldn’t have been happier and it fact, we chose PS 130 over other “attractive” options closer to our home (upper east).  We chose PS 130 not only for its reputation and academic rigor but also for its spirit and for the diversity it offered over other neighborhoods.

No buts about it…PS 130 is a large school…about 1000 kids.   Our first impression that first day, drop off and pick-up, was like “WOW”..this is intense but then you realize that it is really quite organized and practiced.  The building itself is large so once the kids are in class, the layout
is quite comfortable throughout the day. The school runs smoothly under the Principal, Mr. Fong, and his APs, Ms. Pearsall and Ms. Thomas and in my eye, the transition from Lilly Woo and APs Epstein & Chin has been seamless.  Classrooms seem to be fairly typical with classrooms equipped with smart boards, AC’s and the kids get access to computers.  Rooms have high ceilings and the teachers can decorate their rooms turning monotone walls into something more cheerful.

The teachers we had were all excellent; academically sharp & capable, communicative, who really cared about the kids. 
Yes, there was a healthy amount of homework, even in the lower grades and a great deal of attention was
  spent on creating strong writers. Lots of book reports, essays, numerous drafts, etc. Other subjects were equally strong/rich including
science and music.   Our kids received an excellent education at PS 130 and both got into the middles schools of their
choice – Salk and East Side Middle.  Other kids in their class went on to Anderson, Hunter, and to many of the
other leading middle schools in Manhattan.  And though they were in the TAG program, I have no doubt that the non-TAG
teachers were just as strong.  It is worth noting that my older son, when he got to Salk, found that he was better academically prepared
than many of his peers.  Son #2 just started ESMS so I can’t really say yet.

At PS 130, there were lots of extra-curricular activities with some tied to Chinatown/Chinese culture which was very cool.  Both our kids were in the Lion Dance Club, marching (next to or under the Lion Costumes) in the annual Chinatown parade.  My kids also participated in the
Drum and Fife Corps, the video club, and more. They did not participate in the school’s two choruses but they are excellent clubs.   I saw that the Inside Schools review called out Rosie’s Kids, National Dance Institute and other programs…all wonderful.   Lots of Arts programs.  In 5th grade, my kids learned ballroom dancing with the best dancers in the school going on to compete against other
schools in the city.  At first, my kids were like “no way, ballroom dancing is silly” but then they loved it (as did
we, the parents) and they (and all the kids) performed beautifully while picking up some valuable social skills along the way.

The Parent’s Association is very strong and is quite adept in fund raising to bring nice programs into the school, in addition to providing extras
for the kids throughout the year. It’s an amazing cast of volunteers and staff who truly love the kids and vice versa. There is also the year-end Banquet held at a big dim-sum house in Chinatown which is a very impressive event with performances,
local dignitaries, auction and delicious food.   Parent Association meetings are conducted in both English and Chinese which I think is spot on.

Our family found PS 130 to be a very complete school; academically strong with tons of heart from administration, teachers, staff, parents and the
kids.   Not only that, it really was a fun school, and down-to earth, where our kids felt comfortable, safe, and 
academically challenged.  Plus, this all takes place in a culture-rich neighborhood.  We’re going to miss our PS 130 days…. in fact, we miss it already.  It goes by so fast!

02M130,ManhattanMom,manhattan,Elementary,823,"We came from a downtown Gen Ed public school with a beautiful campus for Kindergarten and were not happy with it. Too relaxed for us. It seemed to us like our child's teacher had a stigma against us and our child for the child being bright-ish and having a hunger to learn at an accelerated pace. We were lucky to get a G&T 1st grade spot at PS 130 with a youthful but absolutely spectacular and experienced teacher named Ms. Jessica Chan who actually graduated from PS 130 and was trained by the legendary Mrs. Woo. Our child went from being bored and restless to flourishing under Ms. Chan. There was some adjustment from our child's Kindergarten being 100% like Playgarden (downtown toddler and preschool activities place) to the intensity of Singapore Math and daily homework that was actually academic in nature. But we loved it and loved the teacher (Ms. Chan) who deftly had the right balance appropriate for high achieving first graders to learn at an accelerated pace, and warmly treating a kid like a kid. We still save Ms. Chan's famous, well organized Blue Book, as an artifact we want our child to look back on 10 and 20 years later for the teacher who made a seminal impact.  PS 130 frankly was not originally on our radar because of its location but we believe it is a hidden gem that is hugely under-marketed.  It is an outstanding school for parents who believe in academic achievement, and the enhancement programs are actually quite rich. We were so turned off by the Kindergarten experience in the other downtown public school, we were going to send our child to Packer in Brooklyn Heights for first grade, and thinking longer term about moving to the suburbs in high performing school districts. But we are happy keeping our child at PS 130",0,0,0,2017-09-15T10:43:02,1.0,0.166,0.16899999999999998,0.023,0.564,0.03,0.429,0.88,0.009000000000000001,0.049,0.028999999999999998,0.027999999999999997
02M130,PoppyNYC,manhattan,Elementary,823,"Having just finished up our final year at PS 130, I thought it was a 
good time to post a review on Inside Schools. The website has been a 
valuable resource for our family over the years (elementary, middle) and
 now  once again as we begin our high school search.  So, I thought best
 to post here and give back some.  The DOE handbooks really don’t offer 
enough color to get the vibe of a school so I really like supporting 
websites like this one.


Anyway, we put two kids through PS 130, in
 their TAG program, with our youngest graduating in 2017.  We couldn’t 
have been happier and in fact, we chose PS 130 over other “attractive” 
options closer to our home (upper east).  We chose PS 130 not only for 
its reputation and academic rigor but also for its spirit and for the 
diversity it offered over other neighborhoods.
No buts about it…PS
 130 is a large school…about 1000 kids. Our first impression that first 
day, drop off and pick-up, was like “WOW”..this is intense but then you 
realize that it is really quite organized and practiced. The building 
itself is large so once the kids are in class, the layout is quite 
comfortable throughout the day.


The school runs smoothly under the
 Principal, Mr. Fong, and his APs, Ms. Pearsall and Ms. Thomas and in my
 eye, the transition from Mrs. Woo and APs Epstein & Chin has been 
seamless.  Academically and operationally, it feels quite similar.  
Classrooms seem to be fairly typical, equipped with smart boards, AC’s 
and the kids get access to computers.  Rooms have high ceilings and the 
teachers can decorate their rooms turning the monotone walls into 
something more cheerful.


The teachers we had were all excellent; 
academically sharp & capable, communicative, who really cared about 
the kids. Yes, there was a healthy amount of homework, even in the lower
 grades and a great deal of attention was spent on creating strong 
writers.  Lots of book reports, essays, numerous drafts, etc. Other 
subjects were equally strong/rich including math, science and music.   
Our kids received an excellent education at PS 130 and both got into the
 middles schools of their choice – Salk and East Side Middle. Other kids
 in their class went on to Anderson, Hunter, and to many of the other 
leading middle schools in Manhattan. And though they were in the TAG 
program, I have no doubt that the non-TAG teachers were just as strong. 
 It is worth noting that my older son, when he got to Salk, found that 
he was better academically prepared than many of his peers.  Son #2 just
 started ESMS so I can’t really say yet.


At PS 130, there were 
lots of extra-curricular activities with some tied to Chinatown/Chinese 
culture which was very cool.  Both our kids were in the Lion Dance Club,
 marching (next to or under the Lion Costumes) in the city's annual 
Chinatown parade.  My kids also participated in the
Drum and Fife 
Corps, the video club, and more. They did not participate in the 
school’s two choruses but they are excellent clubs.   I saw that the

02M130,Anonymous123,manhattan,Elementary,823,"I have to respectfully disagree with the comments above about the current administration and inexperienced teachers.  
Our two children have been attending PS130 for a few years now and our experience has been wonderful.  With any new administration, there are bound to be changes but we have not seen any negative changes at all following Mrs. Woo’s (former principal) retirement.  Mr. Fong (current principal), Ms. Pearsall (AP) and Ms. Thomas (AP) always have the best interests of the children at heart and they have done an excellent job maintaining the quality and standards of the school.  The school continues to be a high performing school with an excellent academic program and wonderful enrichment activities.  

We believe the school has done a very thoughtful job at “succession planning” so there is not a “shock” to the system with the retirement/departure of any leader or teachers.  Take the transition of administration as an example, before Mrs. Woo retired, she had worked very closely with Mr. Fong (who was then an assistant principal and had been a teacher at the school for years) and Ms. Pearsall (who had been a teacher at the school for years as well) to ensure the “next generation” leaders could capably handle the new responsibilities when the time came for her to retire.  Even after she has retired, she still makes herself available to the new administration for any advice they need.  Ms. Chin (former AP) did the same thing.  The transition to the current administration could not have been more seamless! The same applies to the training and development of the teachers.  This is a school that is built to last and it is very impressive to see the administration and teachers all committed to sustaining excellence for generations to come.

In response to the specific comment about the teachers, it’s true that some experienced teachers have retired in recent years so there are newer teachers at the school, but the vast majority of the teachers are very experienced and have been with the school for years (some for decades!).  Note that these are retirement of older teachers and they did not leave the school for any other reasons - this is a very natural cycle of any organization – you cannot expect the “older generation” to stick around forever!  In the past few years, our children have had a good mix of highly experienced teachers (with one having taught at the school for almost 30 years!) and newer teachers and all of them have been excellent.  We think the administration has done a great job attracting teachers who believe in the school’s philosophy and culture of excellence and the teachers we have seen thus far are very committed and dedicated. There is also a very high level of collaboration among the teachers and they regularly exchange ideas and “best practices” among themselves.  From what we have observed, the more experienced teachers are very active in training and developing the newer teachers to ensure they maintain the same quality and standards of teaching across the school.  

The level of commitment and dedication of the administration and the teachers to the school and the children are really quite amazing.",0,0,2,2017-09-15T21:20:52,1.0,0.166,0.16899999999999998,0.023,0.564,0.03,0.429,0.88,0.009000000000000001,0.049,0.028999999999999998,0.027999999999999997

To a new parent in the school, it might seem aggressive.  However, this PTA works above and beyond to support the school.  Many other District 2 schools have rich parents.  PS 130 does not, but they do not let the students suffer because of it.  Other schools ask for hundreds of dollars to raise money so they don't have to work on fundraising daily.  Our PTA works hard every single day to raise money, so they do not have to ask low income families for $500 or more that they might not have.  I have never seen a more hard-working PTA.  Every dime goes to the school and the kids.  The PTA raises money for new tech, dance, art, renovations, academic programs for the teachers and anything else that will help the school progress.  Even if they do ask me for a dollar here or there, I will comply because I see where it goes.

The PTA runs almost every event and fundraiser, so the teachers can focus on class.  Book fairs, picture day, parties, food drives, etc. - they are even involved in the day to day routine - keeping the drop offs and pick-ups orderly.   Every year, we walk in the Chinese new year parade with beautifully ornate dragons and an amazingly talented drum team.  At the annual banquet the 5th graders perform their best Latin dance routines.  My son takes music, movement, computer, and will be playing on a newly renovated rooftop playground.   Every GT class that he has been in has had two teachers.   The school can focus on the academics, while the PTA can help with the rest.

02M130,AndrewTD,manhattan,Elementary,823,"Hello, everyone. We have had two kids at PS 130 since
2005, and we love this school so much, that we decided to add our input here, as our youngest child is now in the fifth grade, getting ready to graduate for middle school.   We enrolled our son in the first grade G+T program at PS 130 in 2005. He is currently entering the 7th grade at LAB Middle School and remains an A student, mostly because of the study habits he learned at PS 130 -- the most important of which is learning to internalize responsibility.   Back in 2005, our son had also been offered a spot at a terrific private school where our oldest child had attended, but we decided to check out the TAG programs in District Two, as well. Of all the District 2 elementary schools, we selected PS 130, because we were impressed at 1) the attentiveness and engagement of children in classrooms run by teachers who obviously enjoyed teaching; 2) the orderly, sunny switchover of almost 1,000 giggling, well behaved children between classes; 3) the aestheticism of a 27-million dollar renovation; 4) the impeccable cleanliness of the halls, classrooms, nurse’s office and cafeteria; 5) the quality of the children’s writing and work samples  displayed on the walls; 6) the quality, dedication and thorough attention to parents and children by the Parents Association—Lisa, Diane, Miriam, John, and other dedicated daily persons, and; 7) the principal herself, Mrs. Woo, who personally took the time to give the tour. Impressive. We cancelled our spot in private school.  

After going through both the private and the public school experience, we consider PS 130 an excellent and comparable choice on many levels: academic, psychological, and cultural. The educative style is a balance of traditional and progressive teaching, which means our son (and also our daughter, enrolled two years later) learned to be able to concentrate over long periods of time while enjoying themselves in school; to re-do work when it wasn’t good enough without feeling punished, but, rather, galvanized to be their best selves; to become  independent and able to prioritize and manage their own workloads; and to learn the rules of grammar, spelling, diction, math and the laws of logical thinking in essay writing, science experiments and chess to a level many others could not.   The school’s educative approach pleases me, as a British person, because it is similar to a British education in its discipline and academic practice. By the time our children graduated fourth grade, they could multiply and divide rapidly, in their heads. As my son grapples with complex math in Middle School, he never has to pause to check his basic arithmetic or use a calculator. The same is true of their spelling and grammar usage—the weekly word studies ensure that my children not only understand how to spell, but also how to define a word. My children automatically go deeper, searching for a more accurate, more complex word to use in an essay or everyday speech. They’ve learned that playing Scrabble with an open dictionary is fun, as are speed games in arithmetic and number sense.  

Though some may have noted that the school is dominantly Asian, we consider this an asset. Our kids experienced something wonderful, almost as if we had traveled elsewhere: they were steeped in another culture at an age young enough so that they were completely unconcerned with ethnic and cultural differences. As such, they have found listening to Mandarin and Cantonese to be natural and instinctive; they are as thrilled by Chinese New Year as they are by January 1. My son took great pride in being one of the drummers in his year for the Chinese Lion Dance club, and practiced after school every Friday afternoon for all of fifth grade, and participated in these dance displays on the streets of Chinatown on Chinese New Year, and on performance tours at private schools.  

The teachers have been there forever and are smart, engaged, quick to smile and care about the children. I only know the TAG teachers, but they are all gems: Ms. McConnell, Ms. Nicklas, Mr. Siu, Ms. Mieszkowski, Ms. Flagler, Ms. Pearsall, Mrs. Koa-Chan, Ms. Moncrief (now Mrs. Cho), Ms. Chen.   The school makes it a point to provide enrichment from fundraising. The science, library and music programs are all vibrant: my son participated in ballroom dancing, theater performance programs, debates, violin lessons, the drum and fife corps, chess, Young People’s Chorus, School Chorus, and the Lion Dance Club. The librarian responded with a bounty of ideas to my request for suggested books that would challenge our son, but not introduce themes that were inappropriate for his age level.   There is a collaborative art program with an art gallery space downtown, where the children work with an artist in class and have a culminating exhibition of their artwork at the gallery at the end of the residency. Field trips are fun and educational, from trips to restoration villages, Japanese tea ceremonies, or the Bronx Botanical Garden, the latter to learn about the life cycles of plants and trees in the context of learning to write a research paper.  

The aftercare program at PS 130 is an incredible value. Operating through a Community-based organization, the cost is less than $1,000 for 3-6 pm, Monday through Friday, September through mid June, with a teacher or tutor providing homework support and care. A full healthy meal is provided by Food Services each afternoon. There are also enrichment activities offered, for an additional modest fee, such as Mandarin, gymnastics, basketball, modern dance, piano and violin, depending on interest and enrollment. Whenever we picked  up our kids from school, we saw quiet groups of children reading, working together, tired but happy, with connected, caring adults all around.   Discipline and academics start in pre-K at PS 130; kids learn pencil grip, writing, leadership skills, switching tasks regularly without tantrums, sharing games together, and honing initial math and artistic skills. Mrs. Koa-Chan, the Pre-K teacher, is outstanding; humorous, warm, firm, organized. The three and four-year-olds are expected to sign in and out themselves(!) and by the time they graduate from Mrs. Koa-Chan’s class, they can.    At the start of first grade, our children were ready to write essays, read books and concentrate for hours at a time.   

When our daughter sat for the G+T exam during pre-K, the City had just steeply increased the standards. We sat with the PS 130 Guidance Counselor, Debbie Zaslow, to see if the non G+T classes would provide the same opportunities for our daughter to enter into fine middle schools, or if we should consider private schools, instead. Debbie showed us the impressive statistics for children exiting PS 130 Gen Ed classes into the best middle schools: Salk, ESM, LAB, NEST, Baruch, etc. We were convinced that we would be pleased with our daughter’s education in Gen Ed as much as in TAG.  

Because discipline is taught in a gentle, orderly way with kindly but high expectations, the children are unusually attentive and exhibit emotional fortitude and endurance, making the large class sizes non- threatening to the learning process. The years progress with quiet respect for the learning process, and enjoyment through collaboration, anticipation of reward through thrilling field trips, and the pleasure of pleasing a teacher who is devoted to you.   We were concerned about the infrequent outdoor recess, but neither our son or daughter had a real complaint about this in the end. At lunch, they ate with their friends and then played together—usually card games, or with toys brought from home. They learned to concentrate from 9-3, and play from 3-5. There are two great playgrounds a few blocks from the school, in Little Italy and Chinatown as well as some relatively inexpensive after school neighborhood athletic opportunities available, such as gymnastics, ballet, modern dance, swimming, Tae Kwon Do, soccer and basketball.  

Mrs. Woo is amazing. Not only is she the heartbeat and success story of PS 130, she makes a point to get to know you and your children from the opening tour to the day of graduation. I am not alone in knowing that her door is always open (literally, it is hard to walk to the office without catching her eye), she always answers her phone—often the school phone, actually—and knows the educative journey and personality of the children. When I was not sure which Middle School to send my son, she stayed on the phone and helped me for over 30 minutes weighing the pros and cons of his choices, against his personality, strengths and learning style. She gave  it her full attention, even using her own children’s experiences as examples.   When my son exhibited worrisome behavior in the third grade classroom, she called us in, and gathered together a team of educators, occupational therapists, a psychologist and herself to review my son’s behavior and test his concentration and coordination. I have never seen such swift, caring, and accurate evaluation of our children before or after PS 130. The graduates are loyal, and at the annual banquet or talent contest, I meet PS 130 alumni from all sorts of wonderful schools and universities who “just come back” because they love it.  

The school is greatly focused on moving the children toward good middle schools, namely, preparing for the defining fourth grade exams. The children work hard, and the rewards are earned.   Going to school in the heart of Chinatown has been an indelible experience for us. Our children, for the first ten years of their  lives, were not in the ethnic majority, an opportunity that we thought would enrich their perspective as adults. Many of their friends are bilingual, including Cantonese, Mandarin, Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Farsi, Urdu and Romanian speakers. We regularly utilize the neighborhood as a resource as well, learning Mandarin at the Church of the Transfiguration on Mott Street; Tae Kwon Do and piano lessons at Confucius Plaza, all inexpensive, compared to elsewhere in the city. 
 As our son considers high school and our daughter prepares to interview for middle school, we feel they could not have received a better educated start in life than at PS 130. 

In August 2013, “The Economist” magazine published an article about how Finland, Poland and South Korea are topping the world in school standards. The winning formula, according to the article, is this: a strong focus on basic skills, respect for the role of teacher, and teachers themselves who embrace the idea that every child can succeed in understanding concepts if they are given the time and encouragement  to build the fortitude to stay with a problem. These qualities reminded us of the teaching style at PS 130.   We realize this is a lengthy paean to PS 130. We’re sad to say goodbye to this lovely place, and decided to set down on “paper” our family’s indelible experience at this unique, elementary school, with its intriguing sets of winning contradictions: large and intimate; progressive and traditional, Asian and European, immigrant and landed; tenured educators with the sparkle and energy of the newly hired; quintessentially New York.    Andrew and Jennie Dunn",6,0,0,2013-10-15T15:11:43,1.0,0.166,0.16899999999999998,0.023,0.564,0.03,0.429,0.88,0.009000000000000001,0.049,0.028999999999999998,0.027999999999999997

02M130,Jane Barrer,manhattan,Elementary,823,"I'm sorry ""alis jj"" but this is just not true.  The G and T program, like all the classes at PS 130, is at capacity - because EVERYONE wants to be at this amazing school, and Mrs. Woo is too kind to turn folks away.  The amazing PS 130 teachers have no problems with their capacity classes; students all get individual attention, and the school culture is warm and friendly and caring.  
Of course Mrs. Woo does not want unqualified volunteers in the classroom, when she has highly qualified specialist teachers already doing a wonderful job with students (just check the statistics.) And by the way it is illegal for an individual to be teaching in a NY public school without both state and city certification, and fingerprint clearance.
The after-school classes ARE consistent, my children got piano, violin and dance classes regularly at a very reasonable rate, with highly qualified teachers, and the chance to present their skills in a delightful end of year recital.
Like all schools in New York, kids don't go out in the playground when the weather is bad.  (Duh!)  In many other schools children are sent out into a concrete yard with little supervision or play props.  At PS 130 when the children are on the roof they are given balls, hoops and supervised fun.  PS 130 boasts the most committed teaching staff - this is a school that no teacher would ever want to leave.  The children at this school are wonderful, their parents are committed, and the integration of the performing arts program boosts every child's self-esteem.
Seriously, if you have young children move to Chinatown to take advantage of this wonderful free school.

My wife and I stopped by PS 130 last Friday, 3/2/12, to submit an out of district application for K admission on our daughters behalf.  What we thought was going to be a short visit to drop off paperwork turned out to be an extended, highly informative, and much welcomed discussion with the school's principal.   We stood at the main office counter, application in hand, asking our various questions, as one of the persons behind it joined in the conversation who, after a few moments, introduced herself as the school's principal.  Seizing the opportunity to barrage her with questions, and probably sensing our ""schools-admission-are-we-doing-what's-best-for-our-child"" anxiety, she invited us into her adjacent office where we sat down for what I estimate was an hour-long discussion.  We went over her history there, our hopes for our daughter's education, P.S. 130's mission, her experience raising and educating two children with very different learning styles - you name it, we covered it!  The larger point being we were more than a little impressed not only by Ms. Woo's willingness to have a spur of the moment, in-depth conversation with two nervous parents, who did not have an appointment, but also by her ability to address our concerns with ease, conviction, and empathy.  Aside from that, the physical plant itself, was lovely - clean - and the attitude from all the staff we came into contact with was warm and welcoming.  There is clearly a culture there that comes from the top down, and we hope to receive notification that our daughter is admitted.  If not, we most certainly will try again as we welcome the opportunity for our daughter to attend P.S. 130, especially after meeting Ms. Woo.

02M130,Jane Eng,manhattan,Elementary,823,"I have two girls in PS130, 1 in G&T 1st grade and 1 in regular Kindergarten.  I am truly amazed that there isn't a huge difference between the G&T and the regular class.  The teachers and staff are tremendously supportive and very responsive.  I work full time and drop off the kids in the AM, pick them up at an outside afterschool program, and I never had a problem communicating to the teacher via a note in the notebook(that is checked daily) or via email.  I can send email in the wee hours when I am just getting around to checking the kids homework or have a specific question.  By early next morning, even on weekends, the teacher responds, and I dont have to wait till parent teacher meeting or have to go and interrupt the teacher during the busy day.  The writing in my kindergarten class is absolutely amazing and astonishes me when  I compare it to the G&T class writing.  The G&T class is create because  it taught my daughter to think outside the box, ask detailed questions.  She went from not really knowing how to read right to level I.  I would highly recommend this school, the only down side is what happens after 5th grade :(. 
The principal is the heartbeat of the school.  She is absolutely amazing and warm.  You can see all that she has done.  All the love for arts and music isn't possible without her support or vision.

02M150,TriBeCa parent,manhattan,Elementary,171,"The school's main strengths  are the sense of community that comes with a small school, the amazing families, and some pretty awesome teachers. The teachers are gifted and caring. The classrooms themselves are good-sized and the curriculum emphasizes project-based learning and creativity, which we appreciate. 

As for facilities, the younger grades eat lunch in the classrooms and older grades go to the multipurpose room (it doubles as the music room). The plaza serves as the recess yard, which has functioned pretty well for years until the current principal decided it was problematic. Previously, the recesses were as fine and normal and active as other schools, no incidents. But since 2013 the current principal enacted a ban on ball or play equipment, which frustrates families to no end. She cites safety but kids have played with balls and other playthings and managed to survive small conflicts and scrapes for decades before Jenny's arrival. It's easier for the recess monitors to not have to monitor active play and instead, the kids are left to run in circles (they do get tired of tag) or gossip about each other. 

The worst thing about the school is the fact that the administration (despite the intimacy of the school!) is almost handicapped in terms of ability to receive any kind of complaint or suggestion. The small front office takes every inquiry or interaction as an affront (like, how dare parents ask questions or raise concerns!). The principal (Jenny Bonnet) is an awful communicator and for unknown reasons, takes complaints as personal critiques. Often the response from the front office is ""we're on it"" (code for ""shut up, go away"") but there's little confidence in their decision-making process. Worse, parents feel personal retribution if they raise concerns that are unpopular or cause anyone to step out of their way or do any kind of hard thinking.  The PTA has been great for years but enthusiasm has dwindled since Jenny arrived. Sad to see the school decline due to poor leadership. Its reputation owes substantially to the strong foundation laid by the previous principal, Maggie, who is now at Peck Slip, and today, it is kind of on autopilot, meaning, of course, the school continues to exist and the kids learn and do well and the families make happy bonds with each other, etc.  But it could be so much more if it had better leadership.",2,0,1,2019-02-14T12:14:24,1.0,0.023,0.146,0.006,0.136,0.0,0.076,0.222,0.006,0.094,0.591,0.052000000000000005

02M150,3rd year parent,manhattan,Elementary,171,"This is our 3rd year as part of the warm, welcoming community of families at PS 150 and we feel very lucky to be here. The review above does not mention that the PTA pays for teacher assistants in every class so the large class size becomes much more manageable. The arts education is great, in particular we have an inspired music program and teacher (who doubles as the gym teacher too!) that are school treasures. The switch to Math in Focus (Singapore Math) is something that the parent body initiated and I am extremely happy with the vast improvement in the quality of math education over TERC. The second graders are routinely performing 3-digit addition and subtraction already, which is a year ahead of where they would be if they were still following the TERC curriculum. Writing and content studies are strong here as well. Our son seems excited by what he is learning (and singing) every day. I

The curriculum is very well-rounded (in both academics and arts).

The above review comments on the large class size feeling ""unwieldy""--but it doesn't mention how we have assistant teachers which reduce the teacher-student ratio compared to other schools in the neighborhood.

The review says that Grades 3 - 5 visit the science lab 3 times a week.  But it should also be known that our K - 2 students have science each week as well.

And with regards to the switch to Math In Focus, the review talks about the perceived challenges for the kids.  There are new challenges with any new program that is implemented.  What the review fails to highlight is that the majority of parents wanted this math program and overall everyone is happy with the change.  

In addition, we have strong content studies in each grade as well as a great arts and music program.  These are tied together in an Arts Festival at the end of the school year in which all the grades participate.

The academics are top-notch and she is reading at third grade level. The class sizes are small - there were 18 kids in her Kindergarten and there are 21 in her first grade class. In addition, the facilities are exceptional. We have two yards and soon will have a rooftop playground and garden. The school also boasts a beautiful library, a computer lab, science lab,  music room and dance studio. I am also very impressed with the enrichment programs, generously funded by an active and passionate PTA. The children learn chess in the classroom, receive visual and performing arts instruction from the 92nd Street Y, and in the older grades, learn about the U.S. Constitution through an enrichment program called Constitution Works. While other public schools in the area are also reputable, none have the small class size that PS 151 has and most do not have the facilities that we do. I hope that as the school gets better known and all the new apartment building construction in the zone is completed, that it will become increasingly popular and admired.

Teachers are warm and  make the day fun while kids learn. There are many activities and outside the classroom things that the kids do like a great library and even a clown class for younger kids.

There is one BIG negative but mostly a problem for parents and not kids. The main office is AWFUL. It is run by a secretary who is totally rude to parents.

02M158,PS 158 mom,manhattan,Elementary,724,"I am a PS 158 mom and have been extremely happy with the school K-2. Once the state testing begins though it's a completely different story. In the inside schools review above, it states that kids who need extra help are encouraged to come for test prep on Saturdays. That's not the case. Kids are required to attend test prep sessions either several days a week before class, after school or on Saturday mornings. If it isn't mandatory it certainly feels mandatory--for all children. Not just those who need extra help. And this is in addition to the 3-4 periods a day spent focusing on the test. I personally know of 5 children who have seen psychologists in 3rd or 4th grade due to anxiety or school refusal because PS 158 puts so much emphasis and focus on this test and the 8 year olds simply cannot handle it. A note was sent home the night before the ELA test began saying to the parents and kids ""Eat a healthy breakfast, wear comfortable clothes, get a good night's rest, don't have them wear jewelry or hair accessories that could be distracting to other students, etc."" It is very obvious that the teachers and/or Principal are incentivized based on the students' scores. Our teachers have been wonderful from K-2 but there is a big shift with regard to workload and just general warmth/compassion after the lower grades. Whereas in the earlier years, the teachers had webpages for the class and happily gave out their email addresses, that doesn't seem to be consistently true. Some teachers prefer to only be communicated with via the homework folder which not only feels cold but also makes it tough during extenuating circumstances.

All in all, I can't say that I wholeheartedly recommend this school.",2,1,0,2014-05-16T13:57:56,1.0,0.059000000000000004,0.16,0.003,0.10800000000000001,0.015,0.073,0.126,0.022000000000000002,0.081,0.706,0.096

 I'm reading all about how the ADULTS feel about the school and their children getting good grades; what about a childhood experience? 
And, I see lots of lower grade parents comments where sure, a 4 or 5 year old is still having Pre K and K fun and, not experiencing the 3rd and 4th grade ELA pressure.

Can a child get good grades and still be a child? That is the challenge and, if you are willing to risk your kid's experience as a child, then go right ahead to PS 158. 
Speak to the children and you will learn many of them could not tell you where the Met or the Guggenheim are located. Ask them if they can run in the play yard. Ask them how often they go on a 'class trip' 1/2 block away to the park or to Central Park?

Sadly, tragically, some of them do not even know these things are important to experience. 
Parents, these things are important for kids to experience. 
And please stop being an apologist by stating that geez, there are 700 kids and grades are good so they must be doing a good job. It is a false choice. There are many shades of grey and a good, thoughtful leader always strives to maintain a balance between extremes.

02M158,UESFamily,manhattan,Elementary,724,"We are new to PS 158 with a child in kindergarten.  So far we are very pleased.  Communication coming from our child's teacher, the principal and the extremely committed Parents' Association is outstanding.  

We know that in the past others have spoken about the principal being cold, but we wanted to comment that this has not been our experience so far at all.  We knew this going in so have made a special point to be open-minded and take the chance to get to know her a little bit.  In fact, when we were registering in Spring 2012 she stopped and engaged us in conversation in the Main Office saying how pleased she was that we would be joining the school community.  She is always outside of her office at drop off, making sure everything is running smoothly and the children are going to their classrooms.  Obviously she has a lot of responsibility overseeing the physical plant, all of the teachers and staff and, above all else, the safety of our children.  In light of Hurricane Sandy and the terrible events in Newtown this fall, she has communicated with families multiple times about the school's emergency procedures and available resources (psychologists, etc.).  We feel that we could speak with her at any time.  She sent home a very warm letter after the holidays welcoming families back after break, mentioning a word about how she spent her own holidays and setting forth what was ahead in a number of areas.  She sends home notes in backpacks with the right regularity on relevant matters.  

Shortly we will meet with Darryl about the curriculum in kindergarten.  Unsolicited (as far as we know), she has set up this meeting for parents and requested questions in advance.  Our family finds her to be extremely inclusive.

Regarding our child's teacher, we love her.  She has a Master's in literacy (how perfect for kindergarten) and is just the best.  A seasoned professional who is proactive, engaged and loving (which in kindergarten is important as you want them to get the occasional hug or special word of encouragement), but she is very firm, too - in a good way as the little ones can from time to time squirm around, be impatient with friends, etc.  Just the right combination we feel for this age.  We are very happy.  

No experience yet with testing, but our view is that it is a fact of life and here to stay so why wouldn't the school devote resources so that students can perform at their best?  This is exactly the type of proactive environment we seek for our child.

There are numerous speciality classes, even in kindergarten - Spanish, art, music, science, library/media center, physical education, six weeks of chess in the late fall, etc.  Family reading and math mornings occur twice a month where you can spend 30 minutes with your child in the classroom.  On a separate parent observation morning we saw firsthand how our children spend their time.  It was a great glimpse into their learning.  Field trips are scheduled that relate to the curriculum (unfortunately two had to be cancelled in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, but two more have been held since).  Each class has I-Pads, a smart board and other state-of-the-art technology.  The library/media center is very impressive.  Library books are new and never have a ripped page or tear.  Plenty of books in the classroom.

No experience with Club 158, the after school program, but its offerings are extensive and impressive and from what we've heard families are very pleased.

We feel our child's education is off to a great start at 158.  Sure the school is big, but there is a large gym, a yard for recess and an auditorium (not all schools are able to devote space to these resources).  The school is spotless.  You never, ever see a speck of trash anywhere.  Certain areas were painted over the holidays (I thought it was fine beforehand!).

Obviously satisfaction really comes down to how happy one is year to year with the teachers and your child's progress.  So far, so good and we are very encouraged.  Clearly this school seems to be on a good path during challenging times.  We are glad that we didn't bus our child two or more hours a day to a downtown G&T program.  It was a hard choice for us, but we felt it would have been too much at least initially at such a young age for our particular child who tires easily (not commenting on anyone else's child or decision here).  If this is a decision you ultimately have to make, know from one family that four months into the year we can say we made the right decision for us.  ",9,0,0,2013-01-12T10:03:09,1.0,0.059000000000000004,0.16,0.003,0.10800000000000001,0.015,0.073,0.126,0.022000000000000002,0.081,0.706,0.096

Our meetings weren't filled with gratuitous niceties, but who cares? She is running a school of more than 700 children. Does she really have to be nice about whiny moms? 

These mothers think it is their god-given right to storm the principal's office and make demands. Their behavior and the disservice they do to their children - the marshmallow generation- is scary. It seems the ranting here comes from a group of ALPHA MOMS with a false sense of entitlement. They want to tell everyone how to do their jobs. If I were the Principal of PS 158 and had to contend with these mothers on a daily basis, I too would be a bit standoffish and grumpy. Why are we so concerned about her bed-side manner? Why are WOMEN expected to be cheery and smile all the time?

The academics are fantastic. The teachers have rubrics and explain the expectations clearly. Your children won’t just memorize - but they will become critical thinkers. An example is in science class they watch an experiment & then must refute a claim and make a new claim based on the evidence. In English class they work on rewrites so they learn how to hone their writing skills. These are just a few examples. Wagner also has a lot to offer.

I never met a single ""racist"" in three years at Wagner simply for the reason that people who are not comfortable find other schools and do not consider Wagner on the first place. I was shocked to find out how many kids come to Wagner every day from Queens, Staten island, midtown west, and every area of the city except for our zone.
We choose Wagner because the school is a block away from home and our son was a really good student - we figured he would do well in any school but cutting on the travel time would leave extra hours for sports outside of Wagner.
Wagner administration runs the school like a prison - kids allowed to use the bathroom during the school day three times a week, kids are being kicked out of the block the very same second they leave school, several field trips took place on days with the heaviest rain/storm,  
Luckily our family interaction with the school administration was very minimal. On the good side, our class had a very good assistant principal (Ms. Dowd) and very good guidance counselor (ms. Mueller).

02M167,CityMomof3,manhattan,Middle,1379,"I'm going to respond on behalf of the Wagner SP program (I have no knowledge on  the general AP program here). My son graduated from a top elementary UES school. It wasn't until he attended Wagner that he truly came into his own..independence-wise and academic-wise. He really became dedicated to school-work and doing well at Wagner.

the above review is full of contradictions and pretty ignorant! and couldn't be more wrong in certain aspects. My son got into Laguardia because of Ms. Dyer (big salute to her). He had not an ounce of music experience prior to attending Wagner. Wagner is and has always been known as a Feeder school for Laguardia. So, he probably had a hidden talent (I assume) along with the amazing music program here. He also got into Eleanor Roosevelt, as most of his friends also had.. Absolutely no tutoring or private coaches involved on our part!    And many of his friends also took the SHSATs with no tutoring and still got into top schools like Science...what an assumption to say that ""every student "" you knew needed coaching because Wagner did a poor job of prepping?   students go the extra mile for tutoring for those tests because simply put, there's not a single school that can cover every item on the SHSATS, regardless of how good a school it is!.  And ""the UES is full of caring parents with resources...""  Newsflash, where do you think these kids at specialized schools are coming from??? All the city boroughs, many from poor neighborhoods. Many who can't afford Prep courses, many who don't have those resources. These students have something called a natural ability and talent, along with drive! Throw Wagner into the mix (since we're on the subject), and that makes for a pretty good chance of getting into any desired school.
I know from experience ...that a huge amount of Wagner graduates went on to all the top public and Specialized High Schools around. 

 I don't get the issue: your son seems to have had a great run at Wagner, made friends, got into a good High School, had a short walk to school, was able to do sports, etc  And you don't credit the school he's graduating from in the least? it take both a driven child and a good education to accomplish that... And yet you're unhappy with Wagner?

run like a prison? yes , some strict rules but they are needed. Bathroom visits should be limited ...imagine the zoo-scene with 1,400 students roaming the halls.

 not every teacher is great. But take the top schools around and you'll see there are good and bad everywhere. Honors classes are challenging, and regular are on par. 

Wagner has something for everyone. Music program is among the top (and prob the highest funded) of city public schools, and there's an abundance of extra curricular activities.
and Yes, there are kids taking the trains from all over (just like any kid from the UES would need to,  in order to attend other schools of choice), but MANY are from our neighborhood as well...as a matter of fact, from the local elementary schools...And not everybody wanted to go to Eastside Middle even when they know they stood a good chance of getting accepted. 

 Wagner may seem like a sink or swim school at first but I think it's a great school even for the shy, easily-intimidated types. It teaches them to fend for themselves, to become more independent. Sets them up for the real world we live in , a bit more.
 I've witnessed a lot of the typical UES snobbery that comes with ""no --WAGNER isn't for us"".. You'd be surprised how quickly even the most intimidated child can adjust.. much quicker than their parents.",0,0,1,2015-04-29T05:43:19,0.5,0.03,0.17800000000000002,0.016,0.292,0.044000000000000004,0.22899999999999998,0.18100000000000002,0.07,0.162,0.5329999999999999,0.091

If your daughter meets those requirements at the end of the year, you can try talking to Principle Rehn and she might let your daughter advance to SP the next year.  I've never experienced this myself, so I don't know for sure, but this is what happened to a friend of mine a while ago.  The only difference between AP and SP is that the SP curriculum moves a bit faster and is a bit more challenging.  Either way, your child will get a good education.

VERY SMALL. 6-8 only have the top two floors of the school and the hallways could barley fit 2 people especially during transitions people often end up getting pushed around or yelled at for blocking the hallway, but other than that the teaches(most of the teaches) are very kind and supportive. As for the kids  i personally have had too much drama in this school and scince its so small everyone knows who your dating who, your fighting with, who's talking about who and yes this can be good in some ways but i always feel like i don't have many friends that i can trust not to spread our private conversations to the whole school.

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/29/boy-left-in-stairwell/
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A 4-year-old boy was left alone in a stairwell, and his outraged mother said school workers left him there as a punishment for behaving badly.

Cell phone video taken inside P.S. 198 in East Harlem showed the pre-kindergarten student alone, unsupervised in a stairwell, playing with piles of cash.

As CBS2’s Tracee Carrasco reported, the boy’s mother Fatima Scipio claimed the isolation was punishment for her son’s bad behavior, but it went too far and has gotten physical.

“The para-professional has dragged him down the stairs, has pinned him against the wall with his arms pinned against the wall, and he said to me, ‘Mommy, my arms was hurting,'” Scipio said.

Scipio said she found out the harsh punishment has been going on for the last three weeks, after the video was taken by a school employee who was disturbed by the boy’s treatment.

“If this mom had done that in her apartment building and put her son in that stairwell, guess where she would be right now? Jail,” community activist Tony Herbert said.

Scipio said she’s had issues with the school since last November over her son’s behavior, but hasn’t gotten anywhere.

“I get numerous phone calls each and every day that my son has spit, kicked, and did all of these things, and I’ve asked the school ‘what are you guys doing to my child while he’s in school? What is the reason for him to behave in this manner?’ Because my child does not behave in this manner in no shape or form at home at all,” she said.

Scipio, along with the family’s lawyer and Herbert, is demanding the school answer for its actions.

“For them to treat my child in this manner, I am flabbergasted,” she said.

In a statement issued Monday night, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education promised a swift response.

“We are investigating this alarming allegation and taking swift action. There will be additional guidance counselors and social workers at the school tomorrow and our top priority is keeping all students safe,” said Toya Holness, Deputy Press Secretary for the DOE.",0,0,0,2016-03-02T15:43:25,1.0,0.067,0.24100000000000002,0.009000000000000001,0.36700000000000005,0.07200000000000001,0.301,0.231,0.111,0.218,0.40299999999999997,0.124

Someone in the comments below mentioned Ms Pappas. She is indeed amazing. Other teachers our kid has had over the years have been also excellent. Lots of respect for the work they do and for how hard they try.

The PTA tries really hard also. They have been helping to improve the school in many ways. You have to realize that not all families are involved or care. But the PTA does a good job at rallying those who care to raise whatever funds they can and find volunteers to improve the school. 
The staff is nice, in particular they have a parent coordinator who is extremely helpful and responsive.

My only complaint would be the Principal. She openly dislikes G&T families whose sheer existence clashes with her socialist world view. Additionally I have doubts about her ability to manage a school. She seems ineffective to me. She loves to hear herself speak but makes no sense when she speaks at parent-teacher events. The only thing she consistently mentions is that her daughter went to Princeton and that it is typically irrelevant.

Considering that she used to be the assistant principal of P.S. 77 for many years this seems to be a bit unbelievable.

02M198,Chengang Zhang,manhattan,Elementary,432,"I went to this school as a student years back. I was bullied quite often because I was a certain race. The staff at this school are also pretty bad. I was told that the administration would keep something to themselves. But what ended up happening was that all the teachers knew about the thing the staff promised to not tell anyone about. So one day in class I was helping a student with their work and showing them how to do it as the teacher was going over the work. I was called out and the whole class was told of the thing that wasn't supposed to be told to anyone and not known to anyone but the admins. So anyways I was questioned by many students and told them the teacher probably messed up names or something. I never took action to what happened that day. Also that teacher I'm told of from my younger friends that attend the school is still in the school as a teacher. I'm very disappointed that the staff didn't keep their promise to my parents and me. I'm also disappointed that the teacher would just blurt out something personal to all the students. I think that one of the teachers that were told of this thing was better about it and just talked to me about it. But the other teacher was outrageous and just blurted it out to everyone. Also that teacher that told everyone wasn't the official teacher of that room and wasn't the sub either. But I see that the principal who knew about the thing isn't the principal anymore. I hope the new staff and admin is better and is more efficient in keeping promises.

Also the official teacher used to make mistakes in math. I would wait until after she was done teaching so that I could tell her personally. The lesson I remember was the area of odd shapes. The teacher stated that you can imagine pushing the lines out then find the area of that. Then she told the class the final result was the answer. And surprisingly my peers actually believed her. At the end I went up to her and showed her she was wrong. She hesitated at first. Then I proved her wrong by solving it in a different way. Then telling her the way she did it was missing a couple of steps. 

I'm a student that attended Ps.198 from K to 5th grade and those years were tough for me not because of the admins or the teachers. The students were often bullied too. But I hope that's not happening anymore. I hope this school has improved from when I attended this school. I went to Wagner Middle School after Ps.198 and now I'm going to a specialized high school.

02M198,A Parent of 2,manhattan,Elementary,432,"I have two children who attend PS 198 for the past year and a half, and what a difference a year makes between 2010-2011 & 2011-2012 school years. Sadly for the worse. 
While I fully understand the impact of budget cuts, collapsing of classrooms, lack of parental involvement and a tough fund raising environment. The PTA does its best at trying to raise funds throughout the year, they have received Grants for various programs and equipment (SmartBoards). So to that point, the PTA is doing the best they can to improve a school that is, in my opinion, not heading in the right direction (the school has been downgraded from a ""B"" to a ""C"" in the past year). This should be a total reflection on the Administration and the heir apparent lack of respect the teachers have for the ""Leaders"" at PS 198. Just look at the School's progress report, it's quite an eye opener. 
What I don't comprehend is the lack of accountability from the Administration at the school. They offer excuses rather than answers. For example, I asked if teachers, new to teaching or who are teaching a grade they have never taught before are offered any type of Mentoring program to help them. The answer that I received was astonishing: ""I'm their boss and if they need help they can come to me"". Apparently the administrator didn't read the Schools Progress Report submitted by the teachers. I also questioned how a teacher with no specific grade level experience was qualified to teach a specific grade and the response was ""we do this all the time, it's on the job training"". My response to the administrators was isn't that a big gamble, especially when this year is vital to my child being prepared for middle school. The administrator's reply was, well there was no response, just a blank stare. And that stare spoke volumes. 
While our youngest child has had great teachers, they challenged, recognized weaknesses and worked with her to achieve her goals, our other child has had a completely opposite experience. In my opinion this is such a polarization of teachers, you do not know what you will get from one year to the next. The administration may want to gamble with our children's education, I certainly do not.  Again, a complete reflection of a dysfunctional 
administration. 
PS 198 needs a change in it's leaders in order for our children to be prepared, excel and inspired.  
I know the grass is not always greener but I'm tired of stepping in manure.

The principal was a teacher at the school for over 20 years and was promoted to principal 3 or 4 years ago. Therefore, she’s basically managing her colleagues. The parents have no say and/or not respected by many teachers. There has been a lot of turnover and the teachers that are there are not genuine. There is a lot of bullying at lunch and recess which is not managed well or monitored. The parent coordinator runs the whole show and definitely will not go out of her way to listen to a parent and make things right.

02M212,billrandle,manhattan,Elementary,327,"Before we entered Midtown West we'd met numerous parents of both current and former students who were uniformly ecstatic about their experiences at the school, so we felt those recommendations were sufficient reason to make MTW our first choice. While the school administration (both Ryan and now, Kay) have been solid, and we acknowledge that leadership is one of the keys to success, at the end of the day it really comes down to teachers, and we can't say enough about Sarah Hellerstein, our child's teacher for kindergarten and first grade.

If we could have designed a teacher from scratch, it would have been Sarah. She is exactly the right combination of kind and firm and she can switch gears seamlessly as needed. She never loses control of her class either at school or during field trips, and yet she provides plenty of room for kids to move around and be active and engaged in everything they do. A big part of Sarah's magic is the way in which she allows young children to be independent and energetic while still maintaining the ability to reel them in when it's time to settle down and focus. 

For being relatively young, Sarah exudes confidence and composure and doesn't hesitate to deal with students and parents in a manner that is appropriate and always professional. There was never a moment when we doubted whether our son was receiving the best possible education at Midtown West and we would attribute the lion's share of that credit to Sarah and her superlative teaching skills. We are hoping the next loop (2nd and 3rd grade) is equally outstanding but we'd probably be satisfied with even half as good as what we've had thus far!

I should add, by the way, that we have been pleased with virtually every teacher we have encountered at the school, from art to music, as well as all the extended day teachers who work hard to provide our child with a variety of constructive and exciting after school learning experiences. Of course we talk to other parents all the time in every grade and the vast majority are very satisfied with their teachers.

In terms of overall culture, Midtown West subscribes to the Bank Street philosophy, which attempts to strike a balance between academics and socialization by recognizing that children develop at different ages and phases. It puts the onus on teachers to take into account the unique personality and learning style of each child and avoid the kinds of standardized approaches to teaching that can easily result in all students being painted with a broad brush. 

For parents who plan to start cracking the whip on their kids from the moment they arrive in kindergarten and push them to excel and compete with other children to get ahead of the pack as quickly as possible, Midtown West probably isn't the right fit. For parents who place greater emphasis on the emotional and social development of their children, you will feel right at home at Midtown West. MTW isn't about constantly comparing your child to all the other children, it's about trusting your child to develop at his or her own pace and knowing that the teachers at MTW are skilled at helping ensure he or she can excel and move forward when the time is right.

Anyone reading this or any education blog about NYC public schools probably knows that the primary difference between a ""great"" school and the many average or ""not-so-great"" schools is parent involvement. At Midtown West parent involvement is exceptionally high and the PTA is strong and active, and it shows in the overall success of the school.  A few parents complain that certain other parents are too involved, but we actually feel grateful to those parents who keep their finger on the pulse and help ensure the smooth functioning of the school. Given a choice between parents who were perhaps a bit over-involved, versus parents who didn't pay much attention, we'd take the former every time. Some parents have the time to dedicate themselves to our school and we are grateful for their efforts. 

In terms of academics, Midtown West has a very strong, innovative curriculum that has resulted in our son working several grades ahead in both math and English. While we're glad he's doing well in those two key subjects that everyone seems to care so much about, we are equally delighted that he excels in play, and art, and music, and various other subjects that make him a well rounded, versatile kid. 

In the final analysis, we feel elementary school should mostly be about having fun and learning to work collaboratively with other students, so we're not constantly monitoring the curriculum and worrying whether our son is being properly ""challenged"" (a popular euphemism for ""being pushed hard to excel""). As the Bank Street philosophy suggests, we are confident our son will get to where he needs to be at the appropriate time, and elementary school doesn't need to be a crucible that begins the journey to ensure our son gets into Harvard. There will be plenty of time for buckling down on academics in middle and high school and for now we're content for him to just be a kid.

If I can distill everything I've said into one comment, it would be: We couldn't be happier at Midtown West!",0,1,0,2017-08-29T16:03:14,1.0,0.024,0.138,0.003,0.27699999999999997,0.024,0.14400000000000002,0.147,0.07,0.242,0.47100000000000003,0.156

Many negative comments below I do not find fair. I was indeed voluntarily involved as a parent but not beyond reason: I chaperoned with great pleasure, I made some presentations for MLK day, I contributed financially what I could, my wife cooked and assisted in some dance parties. Academically, the school gave my son a very good background: he is now Arista member, average GPA 96, getting ""double 4s"" on state tests for several years now, good or excellent behavior. About to be tested for the SHSAT... Not to diminish many outstanding teachers of the school, but Tisa Farley certainly stands out as a very genuinely caring of the students for many years.

There are parents who involve themselves to the point where it's more than necessary. They don't let the teacher do the job they were hired to do. I've spoken to parents, who email or visit the school EVERY day to make sure their child is being treated fairly. That sounds like a parent, who had issues of their own while growing up. You can't be there every second to put your child in a bubble. If MTW allows kids to get bullied on a constant basis by other kids, kids of these helicopter parents, then there is no relief. A school that cherishes parent volunteers, but care nothing for parents who work full time, then we are all in trouble. On the outside it would seem like this school is perfect, but keep in mind that some of the parents, who believe in this perfection are probably volunteering every single day. You can have your own opinions, but there is much going on under the exterior.

There should be a limit though - parents should support, not run the school. Volunteering and fundraising are great, but the almost-daily emails are excessive - I dread seeing yet another reminder. School feels understaffed. The bullying, probably varies from child to child. Unless it's severe, I've stayed out of it - they need to learn just like we did.

02M212,HappyMother,manhattan,Elementary,327,"PS212 Midtown West is like winning the lottery for your child and this is one of the best entry schools in New York, where your child looks forward to going to school everyday, for the rest of their education.  My daughter was in K-5th, finishing in 2011 and she still goes to the 'Hoedown', the first event of the school year, to meet with her friends and former teachers.  The Teachers, Staff, Parent Coordinator, and the Principal (at that time, Dean Ketchum) can be lauded for the excellent learning environment they have developed and the high standards they continue to practice. The academic curriculum is comprehensive and balanced, and sufficient creative time allotted for the students to allow them to zone. The teachers integrate the classroom learning with field trips and programs that allows the children to immediately tie in the historical significance of Paul Revere's ride in Boston, the geography of Central Park and the experience of attending Broadway shows, the Metropolitan Opera and Jazz Standard. I was a working, single mother in a high-stress corporate job and I can only thank the PTA parents who contribute their time & energy to provide this school with funds for school supplies and tremendous programs. The Extended Day after school program is well structured, affordable, very safe, with several activities available.  The Alpha Moms/Dads who spearheaded various committees & activities deserve praise for their tenacity, generosity and kindness.  Parent participation is crucial because there are concerts, fundraisers, auctions, committee meetings that make Midtown West so successful in reaching academic and community goals.  The diversity of the population in economics and ethnicity only lends to each student's exposure and acceptance of these differences and cultures.  If you can volunteer as a class parent, you will see how the teachers manage their classes and their great appreciation for your assistance in scheduling snack provisions, getting permission slips coordinated and relaying information to other parents. In an unfortunate and isolated bullying incident, experienced by my child, and upon investigation by the teacher, it uncovered multiple student victims as well.  The teacher immediately took action and kept me informed on the steps taken for resolution and to prevent future recurrence.  Should this happen to you, keep the teacher updated because bullying does not go away by itself.  There are many upsides to MTW - your child will make many friends and your interaction with other parents will be a benefit to you as well.  This is what makes New York a dynamic city - a school haven, amongst many in this city, that embraces your child as an individual and initiates and instills life-long learning and academic achievement in each student. And the plus is, the students are having the best time of their life!",0,0,0,2013-10-08T12:31:57,1.0,0.024,0.138,0.003,0.27699999999999997,0.024,0.14400000000000002,0.147,0.07,0.242,0.47100000000000003,0.156

My daughter will be moving into 6th grade this Fall 2011.  We are moving into NYC this Summer from the North Fork and 
I feel a bit overwhelmed with all the options and would appreciate any thoughts/referrals/comments with regard to best schools for a very gifted and emotionally intelligent child, who has a passion for art and language arts, excels in science and social studies and is athletic - she's been on a State Championship swim team this past year and is the star swimmer.

She's very creative, communicative, social and empathetic.  She has a tendency to regress when she is not challenged.  

I'm keen to find the right school environment for her and will move into it's zoned neighborhood and/or ensure that I get application into lottery based options if applicable.

Again, my daughter is going into 6th grade in the Fall...

Any thoughts appreciated.

He loves learning, and this is what we think elementary schooling should be about.  He's also reading above grade level and what he learns in math continues to surprise me as it is far more complex than I'd have imagined for a 7 year old.  

This year the school added a full time librarian to the list of specials teachers, and this has been yet another reason he loves reading.  He comes home with new books each week and shares how the librarian helped him find a book that interested him.  In addition to weekly trips to the library he also gets weekly art, spanish, music, art, coding, and gym.

I've been on the island for a while and it has been interesting to watch the school develop after the new principal, Ms. Beckman, took over.  I think she was handed quite the challenge and people are often hard on her but she has brought the school far in the time that she has been principal.

He is reading at a very high level, he's doing 3rd grade math with ease, and most importantly his teachers inspire him every day to be respectful, to be curious, to work hard and to love school!  He's developing amazing critical thinking, reading and writing skills at a very young age.  And all this without a heavy homework burden, which is important to us - gives him time to be a kid and he is not starting to resent school (unlike many children of my friends who are parents at other schools, for whom homework is a real struggle).  He is also benefitting from all of the enrichments offered by the PTA, including art, gardening, yoga & movement, dance, and the New York Historical Society residency, just to name a few.  In addition, PS/IS 217 is a wonderful community - as a smaller school, everybody knows my son's name, and he loves going to all of the great school events sponsored and managed by the PTA.  The Halloween Carnival, auction, International Dinner, movie nights - he loves all of the events and really enjoys spending time at his school.  Thanks to a dedicated administration, very active and involved PTA, and strong community ties, this school just seems to get better every year.  Deepening the Cornell Tech relationship and the development of the green roof are just two of the many exciting things in store for this school - it has a *very* bright future.

There is a tendency for new people or even long term island residents who ares removed from the politics of the island to see the school as some multicultural utopia, an undervalued gem housed in a beautiful building. The building is beautiful but there are ugly things that happen, mostly mediocre but sometimes neglectful or malicious. There are good teachers even in the general Ed program, you may get them consecutively. Your child may make friends that look different then them, there is a dedicated PTA and smart kids.

My child has not been bullied but others mention it, I wish there were some more specifics about when/where this is occurring. The school started the Dare to Care program as a response, perhaps more is needed? 

The librarian was cut due to the school budget being slashed, but I think it's not a bad way to save money in these dire fiscal times as there is a public library a few blocks away. 

I think the PTA has done a phenomenal job bringing in programs like the Gold Opera, gardening, ballroom dancing, studio in a school etc. in light of budget cuts. There is also gym, a great music program and science. So, in comparison to other public schools I wouldn't see special subjects are being cut back. 

There is more outside time here--twice a day--then any other school I know about. Many students do not have students go outside at all. 

Lots of worksheets. Agreed. There needs to be more hands-on activities and real world experiences. In my opinion, this is the biggest problem with the school. Seems like it shouldn't be too hard to change, really wish it would.

Constant assessments. Agreed, but they are only giving what is mandated by the city, so that is not a fault of the school. In fact, it helps teachers know what levels students are performing at so they are grouped appropriately. 

Institutional feel. I couldn't disagree with you more. In the dozens of times I have been in the building everyone from the secretaries to the parent coordinator to the ap have known me and my child and made me feel very welcome. I have worked in public schools and attended them. This one has the least institutional feel of any I know. 

 Movies during the school day. Yes, at times. I think it is for emergencies, like when teachers are being made to help with the citywide and statewide tests. Blame this one on all the testing. But, in comparison to our zoned school there are not so many movies shown. Our zoned schools show movies the entire winter when it is too cold to go out. Here the parent coordinator and aides do a remarkable job thinking of things for kids to do when it is too cold to go outside, like play freeze dance, color, dress up, etc. 

School received a D, yes. I am quite sure it will be higher this year. 

Most of the top students leave. Disagree. The entire second grade g and t is entering 3rd grade. 

Admin adverse to parental involvement. Disagree. The admin is required by law to ask parents to undergo training, I think it's three days in the city so we know who is in the building working with students. The PTA desperately needs more help. It is the same few people doing everything. So we need more parents involved.

The answer is they are the same with a different way of saying they differentiate.  This is true on all classes across the city now. Next they can work faster...well not all GT kids are there or scored for entry for the same reason.  The focus listed was no where to be seen or articulated.  It was clear the principal did not have a vision for G&T which could be the only thing she has to attract students at this time.  The majority of the hand out is cut and paste from online.  What does that say. There was no evidence or examples spoken about that described independ reasearch based on interest, internet skills (I may be mistaken but I do not believe the classes even receive computer instruction any longer. The school does not have a connetion to Renzulli for individuals, so I dind it troublesome that 217 can possibly include this in theschool handout for tours.  We were rushed along and a friend who went a previous day felt the same with the only positive seeing the assistant principal bringing her own books to a K G7T student who was beyond excited and motived.  It's clear there are some hardworking teachers, but without a school learder how far can they possibly go.",1,0,0,2012-04-23T05:30:36,1.0,0.14800000000000002,0.15,0.01,0.295,0.032,0.198,0.287,0.14,0.15,0.358,0.151

If your child is obsessed with sports, that is what they are encouraged to write, read, investigate in their work.  

While the elementary and middle schools are mostly independent of each other, the personal connections between the students and between the teachers and children are maintained through ""reading buddies,"" split grade classes (Pre k-k, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8) and school-wide town meetings.

If that is how you judge schooling, you'd be better off elsewhere. Ella Baker develops thinkers and communicators. Spelling, handwriting, grammar come over time. It is not the priority here. Learning how to interact, treat people with respect, listen, comprehensive learning (whole child-type stuff) and story telling is the sweet spot for this school. As the product of a NYC private school, I am thrilled to see my son develop here. Growing up and learning should be a slow burn.

Probably in all honesty one of the best Public (and prob Private as I have compared with other parents of private schools) PreK programs in our city. The experience we've had there will always have a lasting memory. This school believes in the importance of engaging our child in out-of-school experiences: done by taking almost weekly trips throughout our wonderful city. More than I can say about other schools that don't take advantage of what NYC has to offer in culturing our students. And the fact that the PreK is sectioned off from the overwhelmingly big school is a plus, but at the same time they incorporate a buddy system and give the Prek kids a small part in the end of the year concert.

My child is very eager to learn and I feel because of the k-1 grade combination it is delaying the learning process and does not give the children who are in the appropriate grade level and age 5-6 the opportunity to excel because they have to learning with grade k age 4-5 whose learning development may be different.

Knowing how many high-performing students there are in District 2, we as a family remained cautiously optimistic about his chances, as he applied with a perfect report card and state test scores in the low-4s (4.09, 4.11). Sadly, he wasn't offered a seat. My son is bright and curious, and he'll be fine wherever he ends up going to school (waitlists come out next week, so decisions may change). But if the process of applying to middle school has taught our family one thing, it is this: The stakes of high-stakes state testing are even higher now that they are essentially the differential between getting into and being denied a seat at a screened school like Salk. This, of course, will change for next year, as screened schools won't have state test scores to factor into their rubrics.

Last summer, at least 10% of the 6th grade parents pulled their kids out ... some paid for private schools, others managed to get 'safety' transfers to another D2 school, and I even know a family that left the city because of that school. Hunter and NEST attract 7th grade transfers, which opens spaces in schools like Salk, Lab, etc. and there are many other good choices in District 2, e.g., a couple 75 Morton students transferred to LMC last fall, and at least one transferred out to Quest. You need to go to the District 2 office, and you need to be extremely demanding. There were a few students who's parents were not demanding that ended up being stuck at MS297. Lab administers a test, but I believe the other schools simply look at the report cards and attendance records.",0,0,5,2020-04-19T04:11:50,1.0,0.003,0.155,0.0,0.145,0.013000000000000001,0.061,0.183,0.02,0.096,0.619,0.027999999999999997
02M255,Vivian,manhattan,Middle,394,"I am an Eighth grader at Salk looking to answer any questions. While looking through the comments, I saw this post from a previous Salkie, and wanted to re-post it so everyone could read it. I agree with many things they said, and have added some notes of my own for all.

Hi! I'm an eight grade student at Salk and I've wanted to go to this school since I was in 1st grade. When I found out that I got in I was thrilled. I was nervous for the beginning of the year, being with kids much older than me, but on the very first day I felt immediately welcome. Salk is a small school, which some kids see as a negative thing, and I did too at first, but now I am so thankful for the family vibe that we have here at Salk. I love my teachers. They are all trained professionals who love what they do. I consider them my friends. They are all genuinely concerned about your academic and personal life, if they sense anything wrong with you, they immediately check in with you to make sure that you're okay. I am sad to leave Salk, but I am thrilled and proud with all that I have learned here. Every single teacher helped mold me into the student I am now. I have always wanted to be a performer. I sing and act, and I took part in the drama club for 2 years. However I was extremely unconfident about my singing. My math teacher, Shaun, helped me overcome my fears and I sang in the talent show. I got a standing ovation and I couldn't have done it with out his support. The next day he asked me if I would sing at the haiti fundraiser, and annual fundraiser we have to benefit a school we built in haiti after the tragic earthquake. I accepted and I preformed there. Now I am singing at our graduation and I would NEVER have had the courage to do that if it weren't for him and Amelia, his student teacher. Long story short, the teachers are supportive. Next year I will be attending the Eleanor Roosevelt High School. A school known to be extremely difficult to get into, while 10+ students from Salk got in. Some of my peers are also going to top schools in the state and even the country, i.e. Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Hotchkiss, Beacon, Andover, Saint Anns, and other incredible schools. The school's guidance counselor Leslie is extremely helpful with the high school application process which is incredibly stressful for many students. It is hard for me to put into words my love for this school. My classmates are alert in class and ready to learn from our eccentric and creative teachers and we are excited to see what new teaching method they try out that day. Once we came into class and our teacher gave a us math problems and didn't say a word, he instructed us with his hands and we had to figure out what he wanted us to do, which was to present our problem to the class. He said that he did this because he wanted every child to have the experience of teaching their classmates and he wanted to teach the students to respect their peers, even if the teacher doesn't intervene. I think that a big factor in our Salk family dynamic is respect. It is part of our Core Values, which every student (and teacher) is asked to follow. One of them is to respect those in your community and I think that this particular value is so important because this is one that I see enforced on a daily basis. There is no bullying at this school that I have witnessed. Perhaps 1 or 2 rare cases of some teasing but nothing actually harmful. Students respect teachers, teachers- students, and students other students. Salk has been my home for the last 3 years and I am no doubt going to miss all of my memories here. I love this school and everyone in it and if you are looking for a warm environment with teachers who cater to your specific needs, Salk is the way to go.

*Just to add on to this amazing comment; 
I agree with what they have said full heartedly, and have had many of the same experiences. While I have new teachers, I find that they are engaging and involved. They know each student personally and teach with passion, encouraging every student to use their imagination. We do lots of group work and projects. The workload increases of the three years, but is always manageable and never busy work. We can also come in for lunch or email teachers for help, and if we need an extension (and have a legitimate reason) we can get extensions. We also have amazing clubs like GSA, Green Team, and after-school clubs like Art Portfolio. I am so happy I attend Salk and couldn't imagine going to middle school anywhere else. Everyone is so friendly and I will have formed lasting connections with my friends.


Hope this helps!

Destiny will carry him to wherever he needs to be. Also, finally, I want to share this news I read the other day-  some Australian high school students collaborated with their teachers, have successfully reproduced Daraprim in their school lab for $2 (a life-saving drug commonly used to treat AIDS) that was once price-hiked from $13.50 to $750!

As much as it pains me to say this, as a current parent here this school is appalling in it's lack of community and the way the administration treats parents and students.  The IB program is amazing but a number of teachers are unable to teach it, and the administration does nothing to assist. But more importantly this school is rife with unchecked racism and sexual assault/harrassment.  Currently there is an ongoing situation with a very worrying sexual assault that happened on school grounds and the principal has stonewalled any attempt by parents or students to have an assembly, or extra therapists onsite to assist students who are currently upset.  Teachers and counselors have told students to ""get over this tiny incident"" or ""stop blowing it out of proportion"".

(Typically, I’ve found Clinton teachers to be of a high quality.) I imagine the teachers are pretty overwhelmed. One of the things I didn’t like during this transition is the switch to student-led conferences (nothing to do with IB). We would have found it more helpful to be able to speak to teachers individually to get a handle of what was happening with our student in each class (particularly given students and teachers were contending with a brand new curriculum).  We’re glad that Clinton resumed using Jupiter Grades.  Last year’s Jump Rope was ineffective and made it very difficult to know how students were doing, sometimes until it was far too late.  Students in an 11th and 12th grade are expected to be able to advocate for themselves.  That’s all well and good, but these kids still need scaffolding.  (Again, this is particularly true given the new curriculum).  I don’t think the orientation to the IB for parents was sufficient.  Yes, of course, there were sessions for parents that provided an overview.  But, the nitty gritty of IB was not conveyed.  I expect it will get better for future classes.

02M267,Another Pleased Parent,manhattan,Elementary,414,"Let me start by saying that last year my wife and I were probably right where you are now: searching for the best school/education/environment for our child.  After a seemingly endless search we decided upon P.S. 267.  Our son had had no pre-schooling and we really wanted his first experience with formal learning to not only be fulfilling and strong educationally but enjoyable as well.  We wanted him to develop a love of learning (this was for our benefit as well – who want to fight to get their child to school every day?).  Now, some 5 months into Kindergarten, we couldn’t be happier with our choice.  

The principal, Medea McEvoy, has done an incredible job of creating a 1st class school.  Our son’s teacher, Ms. Cecchi, is fantastic.  She is caring, involved, attentive, and well educated in early education.  Our son is reading and writing beyond our expectations and loves going to school.  From day one he has told us his teacher is the greatest.  The other teachers and helpers are fantastic as well.  Our son comes home singing new songs and displaying his artwork daily and teaches us the games he’s learned in Gym class.  The school aides are always there to make sure the students are where they need be and are safe and looked after – all whilst performing their many other duties (hat tip to Mr. Ivan).   The other parents are active and involved with the school without being annoying and in everyone’s face about it.  I almost began this comment saying we were disgusted with the school and everything about it – hoping to keep anyone else from coming in and ruining the great school we so feel so lucky to be a part of but I am sure the truth will get out sooner or later anyway and, to tell the truth, I think the school getting larger will only make it better.  We are looking forward to the new space in 2 years as well but are very happy with the way things are working out sharing with P.S.158.  They deserve a BIG thank you for being so welcoming and accommodating.

02M267,pleased kindergarten parent,manhattan,Elementary,414,"P.S. 267 has a wonderful principal, Medea McEvoy. She is warm, spirited, tough when she needs to be, and has already succeeded - in just three short months - in establishing a kindergarten program that rivals most private schools. My children attend two of the three kindergarten classes (both of which are extremely small this year - around 15 students - the silver-lining of unexpected enrollment attrition). The teachers are accomplished, energetic, creative individuals who bring out the best in their students. They know how to manage a classroom, to nurture each student, to draw parents into the process of educating each child. The curriculum is demanding yet varied. Students have reading and writing workshops daily, mathematics, social studies and science too. They enjoy outdoor time in the play yard every day for 30 minutes, in addition to gym class twice a week and occasional field trips (all students attended yoga classes at New York Yoga during the last month). They have music twice a week and a double-period of art every Friday. So far this year the students have worked with pastels, watercolors, printmaking and clay - their artwork was even on display earlier this week at Sotheby's as part of Councilwoman Jessica Lapin's East Side Children's Art Show.  They have homework packets every week. Students return completed work and receive new packets every Monday. The children have dedicated spaces for all activities outside the classroom - an art room, a gym, a science room, a music room, exclusive access to the PS 158 cafeteria and outdoor space, and finally a full classroom devoted to blocks, with each class having access to the room for one week at a time.In addition, our school is fortunate to be able to take part in P.S. 158's extensive after-school programs. To get an idea of the amazing options these students have check out <a href=""http://www.ps158.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ps158.org</a> under the Club 158 tab. Athletics, music, art, dance - it is all there and then some - for a semester or for a day. The parents at the school are engaged - nearly a third of the forty or so families are represented on the new PTA executive board. All are eager to see the school receive a permanent zone. Current families are a mix of people that were not able get seats at their zoned schools (PS 59, PS 290 and PS 183) when school started back in September, a few families that chose to attend despite having other options, and several families who recently moved to New York including several doctors and scientists affiliated with Sloan-Kettering, Rockefeller University, New York Presbyterian, among others. While we have generous accommodations within PS 158, we are also looking forward to moving into our new building in two years.

02M276,A disappointed student,manhattan,K-8,831,"I graduated from this school 4 years ago and to this day some of the experiences that had happened to me still haunt me to this day. I went into  middle school coming out of a very rough experience at elementary school with my standards very low, and unfortunately this school only hurt me more. I was bullied mercilessly all 3 years I attended and felt as if I had no allies. When I went to the school about some of my problems it either did not stop or only made things worst. It has taken me years to recover from many of the cruel things my classmates said about me, and the worst part was I was not the only one who felt this. The administration would do little to nothing to stop fights and ignore major issues within the grades, for example one of the kids in my grade was going around and grouping girls, and while this was brought up to the school multiple times the issue still continued. The environment of the school was extremely cliquey and very unforgiving academically, which drew many of my friends to become borderline suicidal which was only perpetuated by the administration that would actively  target them. While The experience was negative, I feel its fair to say what the school did right during my time there, for example most of the teachers really did care about what they taught and I found some of my favorite teachers there that still inspire me to learn. One of the main draws of the school is its small class sizes which can be a double edged sword, however it made classes feel a lot more personable and teachers always knew your name. While the academic environment can be ruthless it prepared me well for high school and college and it never felt unfair. I feel that I should state that my experience is not representative of the whole school and that I graduated a while ago so things might be very different now than it was back then. It is sad because I came into this school with so much hope only for it to just tear me down, but at the same time I can see why people love it. At the end of the day is it a good school academically? yes. Is it a good school socially? from my experience no, however I have kept in touch with some of my former classmates that look upon our years there fondly. I hope that this school has learned how to handle situations like grouping, bullying and violence far better than they did when I was there, and I wish nothing but the best for the faculty.",0,0,0,2020-07-26T21:18:33,1.0,0.032,0.201,0.002,0.147,0.016,0.10800000000000001,0.203,0.04,0.136,0.531,0.086

Particularly in 3rd grade, when the homework grades don't seem to reconcile to the report grades.  When asking the teacher about this, she can't seem to clearly articulate how she can give homework grades that are stellar and yet report grades that are less so.

When she was struggling, her teachers recognized it immediately and worked with her to get back on course. EVERY teacher that she had was incredible, professional, focused on learning and cared about every student equally. The Principal (Terri Ruyter) runs a 'tight ship' and never missed a morning to greet parents and children at school arrival. She always has her door open, responds to emails/inquiries immediately and it was very apparent how much she cared about the students and the school. When we as a community were faced with an act of terrorism last year, I felt confident that my child was safe in her care during a very stressful, horrific situation. I can't say enough great things about 276 and even when faced with difficulties (ie large classrooms' etc), they always made the best of the situations and came thru them with positive results. I highly recommend 276 and in my opinion having gone to a public school as a child, 276 is in MANY ways equivalent to a private school in terms of learning, discipline, caring and daily routines. We miss 276 and it will forever be apart of our lives with many great memories.

02M276,intact 221,manhattan,K-8,831,"I went to IS 276 for about 3 years. I am currently a High school freshmen when I post this. This school has about 30 students per class, 2 to 3 classes per grade. The hallways are very narrow so going to classes are difficult. The hallways get very packed, almost like a mosh pit. This mainly happens when students are getting to classes and dismissal. The stairs are big but students are required to walk up 24 steps to get to 1 floor. Also, the stairs, like the halls, get packed after lunch and recess and dismissal.   Middle-schoolers would chant curses in the stairs when the elementary students are in the staircase. The middle school mainly uses the 7th and 8th floor, and the elementary school is separated. I think that the kids in the school don't respect each other. They call you names like ""f***t, r****d, n****r, gay, etc."" Bullying is also common, but it's more verbal and rumor spreading. You can be in the bathroom stall and people will start throwing wet paper towels at you when you are trying to go. The bathrooms are a mess, especially the boy's room. Puddles of urine are very common. Toilet paper will always be out, mainly from kids throwing them around or urinating on them. I once walked into the bathroom and someone pooped in the sinks, disgusting. What disgusts me the most is that kids drew hate symbols, the nazi swastika, in the boy's bathroom, twice in my last year. Adding on to hate, some students would joke about racist stereotypes, some might find it offensive. The kids do not physically fight each other. The school claims to be green, which I agree is, but kids do not care about recycling and throw their waste anywhere they want. I've seen food stays with liquids and food thrown in recycling bins. But, there is a handful of students who do not clean up after themselves. When the principal addressed this issue, she said ""I don't care if you recycle just throw out your freaking trash!"". The teachers at the school are nice and friendly. But, there is always the one teacher who comes to punch their card and wait for the day to end. I learned nothing in math last year, since one the teachers did not show up for half of the year. She didn't look like she enjoyed teaching and always looked angry. Usually when their is a sub, the class will go out of control. Kids would throw things, scream, stick pencils in the ceiling, and play offensive music with their speakers. There are also teachers who cannot control the class. I learned nothing in science since the kids would do whatever they wanted. Eventually she left toward the end of the year. Also, I had a teacher who threatened to fail the whole class if you do not do the things she wanted you to do. Academically wise, the school is successful. The school has high expectations per students and teachers push students to go above and beyond. Teachers help students become aware of their grades by handing out progress reports. The only thing I do not like is how math classes are separated. There is thee advanced math class that learns math a grade level ahead and the regular common core math class. The advanced math class was the only class that took the regents exam and gained early high-school credits, leaving majority of the 8th grade body behind. However, I think some teachers are very opinionated and less effort on the students they dislike. I also teachers are very bias and teach students their political beliefs. Last year was the presidential election, and all I heard was Clinton support from every-teacher. In one class, a teacher spent the whole class explaining why Clinton is better than Trump. But, I think majority of the students are Trump supporters (I am one as well). There are also radical liberal students; I remember I saw a poster on the wall that showed trump as an orange (fruit) and it said ""I want this out of office"". It was there even after a group wanted it to be taken down. The school has many LGBTQ teachers. There is a LGBTQ club during lunch time for students. The teachers accept students of many genders, sexuality, races, and cultures. The principle doesn't believe in punishment, so many incidents can slide.. If they fight, it's usually outside of the building. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this school because of the toxic environment the kids made. I rate the school a 5/10.",0,0,0,2017-10-03T00:39:15,1.0,0.032,0.201,0.002,0.147,0.016,0.10800000000000001,0.203,0.04,0.136,0.531,0.086

Every school in the country is going to have some families with legitimate complaints.  Maybe Aboffers' son was bullied and this case the school didn't handle it properly.  This is certainly an appropriate forum to voice that complaint.  And then families with positive experiences can provide counter examples and the people reading the boards can make their own decisions.

Also, bullying takes place in all demographics.  Just because the majority of the students are from middle and high income downtown families doesn't mean that the kids can't be bullies.  A middle-schooler at Brearly recently got a severe concussion on school grounds at the hands of her classmates.",2,0,2,2012-05-01T18:49:46,1.0,0.032,0.201,0.002,0.147,0.016,0.10800000000000001,0.203,0.04,0.136,0.531,0.086

There is bullying (though it seems to be fairly typical middle school stuff) but they can not pride themselves on having eliminated it and we've experienced problems throughout the year.  Sometimes the teachers gravitate to the popular kids and reward them a bit too much with special perks.  The classes have gotten big in the 6th grade.  The curriculum is a mixed bag--test prep started in December and then is nearly abandoned in March. One month they teach fractions and then switch to Geometry the next...a month later they're off to statistics.  The math workbook offers no instructional information, just word problems. They've made no attempt to compensate for the lack of lockers and the kids haul huge backpacks everywhere.  They are fixated on saving paper and my child often receives important information about assignments and grades on tiny pieces of paper.  I have had very few graded assignments come home.  One teacher has  students grading each other's quizzes (never a good idea when kids can be teased for even minor mistakes).  No school is perfect--or a perfect fit for everyone.  276 is still finding its footing and is not the happy, shiny place for everyone.

02M276,Neighborhood 7th Grade Parent,manhattan,K-8,831,"After 1.5 years in this school, after having been confronted with a difficult middle school decision, I have come to believe that there are very few, if any, over riding benefits of choosing another out-of-the-area middle school, GIVEN THAT YOUR CHILD LIVES WITHIN RELATIVE WALKING DISTANCE OF 276.  Local parents with children in out-of-neighborhood middle schools seem to under estimate a fair number of frustrating complications trying to make that trip to the school for sporting events, parent teacher conferences, forgotten school books and homework, sick kid, etc.  Also, when attendance counts in 7th grade for HS Admissions, that early morning wake up call to make the public bus, or to face a weather challenged morning and  undependable public transportation, becomes a real issue with attendance statistics which hang over a 7th graders head for HS admission.  Moreover, with 2 parents working, or with a large family, an out of the neighborhood middle school has the potential to generate a pressure-filled and tedious morning, and a complicated afternoon choice of engaging in after school activities or to come home to the apartment at 3 PM.  Local 276 kids walk to school in the morning at 8 AM.  Many stay after school to get started on their homework.  Then, they participate in sporting or creative activities. Afterwards, the kids walk home for dinner.  This is an unexpected benefit of 276.; the middle schoolers not only exercise independence, but also form strong bonds with their classmates post the formal school day. Class unity and spirit is very high at 276.  As far as High School acceptance is concerned, I can't imagine that any one school has any more of a leg up than 276.   For us, the High School admission focus of 276 has been the most surprising benefit of attending the school.  This afternoon in fact, January 10th, my 7th grader will be taking a  3 hour, professionally administered Kaplan  practice test for the Specialized High School exam.   This will be the 2nd practice test, and we are only half-way through the 7th grade year.  Since specialized High Schools only accept kids based on these test scores, (grades, essays, attendance, middle school etc do not count), getting a head start with professional test practicing within the normal school week is yet another wonderful benefit of 276.  For the non-specialized public high schools, important admission statistics such as lateness and absences are easy to manage at 276 given the school's distance for the neighborhood kids.  Also, 276 has an AP Math program, and I think, a very advanced science program which kids can reference in their HS Admission process.  The staff dedication for successful HS admittance is evident too.  Unsolicted, my child's ELA teacher expressed an interest in helping with any Private School admission essays.  Finally, what I recently found re-assuring is the budding relationship with the local Millenium High School which I discovered has a very good reputation, and a surprisingly very difficult acceptance rate.  As you can probably tell by now, as a NEIGHORHOOD parent, I am very happy with the 276 choice. I would even be happy with 276 if we did not live within the downtown area.  However, if you happen to already live near a decent D2 middle school such as LAB, MAT, or SALK, for example, I would not hesitate to choose those schools over 276.  I have discovered that proximity is very important to the student and the family.  However, if you live closer to 276, which has proven itself to me to be an excellent middle school, on par with the ""best"" in my opinion, and with a focused HS admissions process, I would highly suggest choosing 276.  ",2,1,0,2012-01-10T15:18:33,1.0,0.032,0.201,0.002,0.147,0.016,0.10800000000000001,0.203,0.04,0.136,0.531,0.086

I'm the mom of a 1st grader who is in his second year at River. Our experience at River has been amazing. The teachers he has had are intelligent, wise, nurturing, motivated, and accessible to parents. The school is small, so you know everyone and it has a real family vibe to it. There were 3 or 4 field trips last year. This year the DOE was able to hire a gym teacher (last year was paid by the PTA) so there is more attention to phys ed. The student body is very diverse (b/c of the United Nations nearby), so my son is friends with kids from all over the world. Curriculum is excellent - my son and some of his peers read at a 3rd grade level. I wish the school had more in the way of arts, but hey, you can't have everything. My son is happy and thriving at River.

If in doubt, put your child in a solid school( for example ps 116)

If you are asking this question, it means you should consider an alternative .
I have nothing personal against the school but honestly, it is a trial run of a school. The vibe is that there is violence in the school that gets covered up.many of the positive feedbacks are from parents who list their kids name and hope their kids will get better treatment. Good luck!

02M281,Rob C.,manhattan,Elementary,302,"Our daughter started at The River School in Fall of 2014 for Kindergarten. Her teachers Kristin and Nicole are an elite group of teachers that do an incredible job teaching the entire class, getting all students involved and truly bringing out the best of each and every student and the entire class.  They focus on instilling confidence, and growing and maximizing the abilities of every student.  The class is a very warm and welcoming setting and every child enjoys and appreciates the environment so much that they fit right in and focus on all the subjects taught in class.  Students also work together and they develop teamwork skills, every student truly learns how to positively work together.  Students also take this positive energy and valuable disciplines home with them that they look forward to doing their homework and making plans after school and on the weekends with friends they made through school.  They become excellent students, outgoing and socially responsible.  

Our daughter had such a wonderful experience her 1st year at The River School that she was a returning student this year. 1st grade didn't quite get off to the same start as kindergarten, perhaps because she missed having Nicole and Kristin as her teachers, however it turned out that our daughter was very fortunate to have Amy and Erika as her 1st grade teachers. I got to know Amy and Erika very well throughout the school year, and they had an incredible effect on our daughter's education, and truly getting to know her.  Amy and Erika are fully dedicated to every child, the curriculum taught in class, and are awesome teachers. They fully understand every child, and are extremely valuable at getting to know every student, and bringing every student up to speed so that they excel and perhaps even overachieve as Isabella is currently doing.  Isabella was invited to be apart of the River Rise Program and we credit this program for our daughter making significant progress and the improvement she has.  We are very proud of Isabella and are forever grateful for the support that The River School(class teachers/other educators/support staff), grants, the DOE, and especially the PTA have extended to our daughter and all children and families throughout The River School.  

The school our children attend is highly important because it affects who our children are today and who they will become. From my experience and perspective The River School has the best teachers, and the teachers welcome all student families to their classroom every Family Friday. The teachers also keep parents fully in the loop what goes on in the classroom daily by sending class emails, and also gives us parents the ability to stay involved which is incredibly important for our children's well-being and success.  Not only has our daughter benefited from The River School, our family has benefited significantly as a whole.  I feel I personally have gotten a lot out of The River School that I find extremely rewarding with a great sense of achievement and satisfaction that will last a lifetime.

Teachers and staff truly look forward to working here and it shows in their every day care and passion for their students to be comfortable in their own skin and succeed happily. It's also a safe environment and the facilities are perhaps the best in the city. We are very fortunate to have what we have. The atmosphere and environment is very friendly and since it's a small school everyone pretty much knows everyone and everyone is very welcoming and caring. I've become very close with many of the parents that I consider them great friends. I feel very pleased bringing our daughter to school every day knowing she's in the best of hands. We arrive nice and early every day and our daughter looks forward to having her morning breakfast at school with her classmates, this is how we like to start our day.

It’s so important to me to be hands-on that this was my 2nd year as Co-1st Vice President on the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), also 2nd year School Leadership Team (SLT), designated class parent, school store committee, bake sale committee, and I volunteer every time there's an opportunity.  Always remember it’s the people and especially us families that make-up and determine the success of the school and our children’s future.  

I truly appreciate and love my daughter's school, the school itself, the people - staff/teachers/educators/security/other parents and guardians and the overall community - the PTA has sponsored some wonderful events for families to get involved throughout the school year, and most of all I truly appreciate what our daughter is getting out of it every day. This to me is extremely important that find it imperative to give back to the school every chance I can.

Oh by the way, did I mention our wonderful leader and principal Jessica she brings her passion along with the entire River School Family to school and our awesome students every day.

Jessica, the new principal, is really dedicated, motivated and easy to reach. She wants to create a high quality school and she succeeds so far.
We are coming from another country and my son (kindergarten) had to learn a new culture, a new language, to read and write. It is a lot but every day he is so keen to go to school! His teacher, Miss jillian does a great job to motivate him, support him. There is ELS and all kinds of workshop to create a strong learning community.
The whole school is using brand new trend in positive discipline and positive psychology that the positive reinforcement that my son receives every day covers for all the difficulties he can encounters. I'm sincerely impressed and I recommend highly this wonderful school.

Finding the right balance between our home location and a good established school was very difficult so we decided to change our approach and opted to give the New River School (PS 281) a chance with the conscious desicions that we were going to actively participate and help shape the school. We already raised a daughter here in NYC and we knew that a school with a strong sense of community was critical for our children academic and social achievements. We are thrilled to have joined the River School, our son already asked if he could come back next year. He has many friends and can't wait to go to school every day, both this aspects drive his eagerness to complete his homework. We as parents actively participate in the school, we keep good relationships with the principal, the teachers and other parents. It is a new school so there are many things that still need to be defined or organized, we are happy to be part of that process and help shape the education our son receives. 
I know there are not so positive comments but all of them come from people who had their kids in the school the first year. I understand it was a difficult year but our experience in the 2014-15 period has been all but positive. 
I won't recommend this school for any parent who wants to outsource their kids's education 100% to the public education system.

I was stressing all summer about coming back to the school and considered moving to another zone. When I heard we were getting a new principal, I was so relieved. After meeting Jessica, and going through these few weeks of school, she is demonstrating that she is a great leader and has tremendous amount of experience. She is warm, smart, nurturing, positive, respectful and open to collaborating with parents.It's only the beginning of the year but already there have been so many improvements. The school environment is warm and nurturing. You can feel the excitement and relief among all the parents and teachers in the school. Unfortunately, Jessica has to pick up the pieces from a terrible mess; however, I am confident that Jessica will do a great job and improve the school a thousand-fold. I project this school will become as good if not better than the surrounding schools under Jessica's leadership. We lost a lot of great families after last year but hope with the new change in leadership, we will gain more.

02M281,Alison,manhattan,Elementary,302,"I am a parent of one of the families that had a Kindergartener in PS281 last year (2013 – 2014) and made the decision to move in order to get my son out of PS281 because it was such a horrible experience.  I lived in Tudor City and loved the neighborhood, but regrettably, I had to move in order to ensure that my son would get a good elementary school education and actually enjoy school.  So, I moved 10 blocks up so he could attend PS59.  My son had his first day of First Grade at PS59 today, and it was so remarkably different!  It was
unbelievable.  To start, just waiting outside the doors to PS59 in the mayhem of all the children lining up with their classes, you could sense a positive energy flowing through both the parents and the children.  You could see the older children happy and excited to be back at school, which I think is a reflection of their school experience.  This was a stark contrast to the progressively lethargic attitude my son developed towards school over the course of his Kindergarten year at PS281.  It was so sad to see the enthusiasm for school deflate in a child who absolutely loved preschool and pre-K in the two years prior to Kindergarten.  It broke my heart.  That is when I knew I had to move.  Secondly, in the paperwork that came home in my son’s backpack today, there was a letter from the PS59 librarian in which she shared that she had purchased new books for the library that had been requested by the children, she was looking forward to working with the children this year, and she encouraged the children to take home books and share them with their families. Again, this is a huge contrast to the attitude at PS281.  PS281 had a brand new, beautiful, fully stocked and catalogued library that was never used by the children until a few weeks before the school year ended.  The reason: 
the principal’s goal for the library was “to preserve the books.”  So, she didn’t want the children to use the library or touch the books.  This, coming from the principal who claimed that literacy was her #1 priority.  Needless to say, the parents were in an uproar about the students not being able to enjoy their school library.  Through heated debates with the principal in PTA meetings and a massive push by the parent body, the children were finally allowed to go into the library once every two weeks to check out one book towards the end of the school year.  So, the children got to enjoy the library for a few weeks before school ended, but only after a huge war had been waged by the parents.  That whole episode was painful, disheartening, and frankly, unbelievable.  How refreshing to now be at a school where the children are welcomed into the
library!  Finally, one of my greatest frustrations with PS281 was the lack of commitment and teaching as it relates to basic academics.  It became clear very early on that my son was not being taught how to properly form letters, how to sound out words (use phonics), how to read, or how to do basic math.  When I talked to other PS281 Kindergarten parents, they were all observing the same issues with their children.  In talking with other District 2 parents, it became clear that the Kindergarten students of PS281 were way behind their
peers in other District 2 schools.  This was just unacceptable.  As a parent body
we tried very hard to raise these issues with the teachers and principal through the PTA channel, but our concerns fell on deaf ears.  Parents gradually checked out.  This was evident at the last General PTA meeting, where only one parent attended who was not a PTA Executive Board member.  While moving to a new apartment this summer and transferring my son to a new school was a hassle and disruptive, I am so glad I did it.  When I picked up my son from school today, he was so excited and eager to tell me all about it… I can see the sparkle in his eye and that “love of school” that he had prior to PS281 returning to him, and that makes it all worthwhile.",0,0,0,2014-09-05T04:44:40,1.0,0.195,0.175,0.006999999999999999,0.213,0.046,0.166,0.321,0.09300000000000001,0.136,0.41100000000000003,0.15

They gave a lot of time out, sometimes even for an all recess and this was just for kindergarten. Personally my kid never had some but my kid was concern by the way some of her classmates were constantly punish for nothing. They but a very unfriendly and tense relationship. They broke their self esteem by ""labeling"" them constantly with their red / green choices. The social emotional way to handle the kids is really not that great. About academics they do the standard activities,this is how it is the lacks of creativity seems to be an issue in most of the schools in this city Now it's just about literacy and math. Parents want 5year old who reads and does addition and subtraction the common core supports those ideas that is really sad but that is how it is. What can we do ? The kids learned nothing just snap words and addition subtraction of everything memorizing same that any parents can do with flash cards.  
We are part of the 30% of parents who decide to leave the school and take a chance in another one, more friendly , less pushy and progressive. But at the same time  we don't have that much illusion. 
But honestly they are doing the same thing than in most of the public schools around here , they just have less money for field trips and special activities just give money to the PTA and you will have same school as ps 116 or midtown westps 40 ...

The leadership in this school does not exist. There is no leadership. The environment/curriculum (or lack there of) is what we as parents would like to see in a preschool for our little ones learning what it is to go to 'school.' The principal's vision is warm and fuzzy with academics as the last priority. She cares more about being liked and being your friend than making sure she creates a school where our kids will be academically sound and/or prepared for the road ahead. Physical education is non-existent unless you don't mind your child having yoga once a week. Math curriculum...instruction or group discussions is held once a week which is not up to par with our neighboring schools. Teachers are great, well at least my child's teacher is, not sure about the rest, but because of the ""vision"" and controlling hierarchy, they do not teach a vigorous curriculum. So yes your child will be loved and greeted during drop-off and dismissal but no he/she will not know what 2+2 is, what ""field day"" means, or what hands on science is all about.

02M281,Anonymous ,manhattan,Elementary,302,"I have a kid currently enrolled in this school in Kindergarten. 
there are 2 kindergarten classrooms and 2 part time prek.
one has  26 kids with 2 teachers. this a special ed co teaching classroom. and another one 24 kids with one teacher and an aid.
They start the day with the pledge in the classroom some family ask for it only a few weeks ago. During the week the kids have once a week music, yoga ( that the only physical activity offer), Art and sciences in the STEAM lab where parents can volunteer, library twice a month where parents can volunteer and kids borrow one book. 
the kids had only two field trip one in the children museum of Art another to see a show the hiccup paper bags... 
Parents ask the school to buy an oven for cooking project which they do but they never use it. 
the drop off is in the lobby ( not in the classroom) and they go line up in the cafetaria and go in their classroom, (except for the prek) which was very traumatic for a lot of kids and also frustrated for parents no being able to see the art work or classroom project when coming to drop off or pick up kids. they have family friday once a month where parents are allow to stay in the classroom to observe theire kids or do activity with kids.
The playground is covered due to construction and it will be for several years. They will have a small playground in the front of entrance of school but it's not ready yet. Both playgrounds are pretty small we still don't have a clue how they are going to manage with more classrooms.
the atmosphere is quite cold you are allow to communicate by phone call and note in the folder. to have an appointment with the teacher you need to heavily insisted and usually they have 15min no more. we had two parents teachers conferences where they do an overview of your kid but they don't give you a write report. We also had a report card only once.
The curriculum of the school is vague, the principal said she is more Bank Street spirit so you will maybe assume that the school would be more progressive but not really. It seems parents expect totally different things some expect play base, discovery, creativity and cultural awareness, other just want academics and no playtime. But the school seems to have hard time to take an orientation trying to ""pleased"" everybody. So of course it's not really working and a lot of parents complain and try to find other options for next year.
for reading they used a balance literacy way ( phonics awareness and whole language mix) but at the end it seems that the kids just learn sight /snap words by heart and try to find them in books, they also use pattern books with picture to make the kids guess the words. A lot of parents seem concern because they don't see improvement in their kid reading skill. they also bother the kids a lot with the Lucy Calkins method of writing workshop, the kids are supposed to draw a picture and after write a sentence under with no help. 26 kids no writers at the kids time with 2 teachers trying to help. 
for the Math it's the same they repeated the same games over and over. 
we think there is a lack of project they have only a few inquiries since the beginning of the year ( all about me, about feelings and about the school). we don't think this school rock at all :(
i can't really say that we like the school but every parent expect different things so maybe it seems nice for others.

This school (aside from being physically attractive) is a work in progress as a whole. The curriculum is geared toward EQ and not enough IQ.  And that is not an opinion - that was expressed to the families from the start. It misses the point that in this age of competition both locally and globally, a more rigorous curriculum is required. The kids can handle it.  And the parents overwhelmingly support it.  Why lower the bar?  A more seasoned administrator might have made this school work from the start.

For me, this was the right balance for middle school (plenty of time for the kids to feel pressure down the road.) The school very much delivered on these attributes. During our time, the kids experienced being in lockdown after the Halloween terrorist attack on the West Side Highway and more recently, the Pandemic. I could not have been happier with how the school, led by Principal Zeynep, handled those situations. Throughout the 3 years, the kids emotional well-being was consistently at the forefront and communication from the Principal to parents was excellent. I also felt very supported in the high school process (and achieved our #1 choices).  In response to comments from other parents, in every case where I reached out to a teacher requesting a 1:1 meeting, they were happy to do so. IS289 is not the most rigorous academic environment (I agree that math has been a particular challenge. 2/3 of their math teachers were inadequate, however both are no longer with the school.)

While the teachers deeply care about each of their students, they also lack many basic skills. Teachers didn't update grades for many months, and hardly ever returned graded papers. Additionally, the curriculum is far too easy. In 6th grade math, we learned how to subtract fractions on a number line, which I learned in the beginning of third grade. This may be attributed to the fact that IS 289 is a ""magnet school,"" and my grade consisted of kids from Brooklyn, China Town, Chelsea, West Village, and Washington Heights. 289 prides itself on ""inclusivity"" and ""not having advanced classes"" but it is necessary to receive a good education! In fact, when a group of peers in my grade talked the the principal about starting a Student Council so kids could discuss these issues openly, she said that it would be ""too competitive"" and ""teachers wouldn't want to participate."" (Note, when I spoke to 8th grade teachers, they were more then happy to assist us!) The curriculum across all grades is far too simple, and left us ill prepared for High School. When I talked to my 6th grade teachers AND my principal about getting harder work, nothing was offered to me, not even the Khan Academy password so I could learn on my own!! No grammar, vocab or annotation skills taught, no grammar or conjugations in Spanish, and the math curriculum was easy, although I did hear that it's getting revamped. There is an algebra regents program for mathematically inclined students, however, the class meets AFTER SCHOOL. We were essentially taking two math courses, meaning double the homework, double the tests and double the stress, especially during the fall of 8th grade with high school applications! As someone who received 90's or above across the board, did I ever receive constructive criticism on my work? Nope! Always ""Keep up the great work!"" which is nice to hear, but how does that allow growth? Additionally, art programs were horrible, and apparently the art teacher from last year left and nobody took her place. The hallways are a hellhole especially in the 6th grade hallways, with kids being shoved and teachers screaming at the top of their lungs in anger, which reinforces their behavior. The dress code was targeted towards females, and was way too strict. Despite this, there are some AMAZING teachers, namely the 8th grade science teacher and the 7th grade social studies teacher. Also, the school does a great job discussing race and bias, and the GSA is a strong club with many members and a great leader. All in all, IS 289 has great potential. With a revamped math and Spanish curriculum, greater teacher standards, more difficult work in 6th grade, and more school spirit, I believe that IS 289 could become one of the best schools in District 2!",0,0,0,2020-06-05T15:31:06,0.75,0.049,0.22899999999999998,0.0,0.484,0.095,0.39799999999999996,0.486,0.042,0.14800000000000002,0.29600000000000004,0.066
02M289,J.P.,manhattan,Middle,284,"289 has some of the nicest facilities in D2, in part down to a post-911 grant that means the school is well funded. It's small - 3 classes per grade. It's clean and classrooms are bright and airy. Kids have lockers and out-lunch beginning in 7th grade which my daughter enjoyed. At time of writing there is no art or music in the curriculum. The art teacher left in 2019 and wasn't replaced. The principal is reaching out to parents to help implement an art program. Music (Orchestra) is only available as an after-school activity. Other middle schools offer electives. 289 does not and it's a shame as the kids could really use some light relief. While project-based, the curriculum is pretty gray and joyless. Parent-teacher conferences are child-driven, a progressive idea that is excellent in theory, but the reality is that your child reads from a sheet of paper, while their academic coach types up notes and asks if you have questions at the end. With the exception of curriculum night, you do not get to meet your child's core teachers unless you request a meeting and the teachers are hard to pin down. The teachers are by and large unenthusiastic and do not respond to emails. 7th grade teachers are not generous with their grading which negatively impacts kids applying to public high schools in 8th grade. Think GPAs in the low 80s compared to the high 90s regularly given out to other middle school pupils that your child will be competing against. Despite enjoying her time at 289 where she was popular and made friends, both my daughter and I agree if we could do-over we would not send her to 289. Uninspiring, from the principal down.",0,0,0,2020-01-28T14:04:11,0.75,0.049,0.22899999999999998,0.0,0.484,0.095,0.39799999999999996,0.486,0.042,0.14800000000000002,0.29600000000000004,0.066
02M289,D.P.,manhattan,Middle,284,"IS 289 has so many things going for it: new facility with spacious hallways, safe location close to public transportation, friendly & approachable female administration, diverse student population (compared to some other D2 middle schools), a progressive, project-based curriculum and some really excellent teachers.

The Science and Social Studies curricula are innovative and engaging.  Students learn about real world problems (ie climate change, discrimination, social identity), set goals with Coaches and also independently, work collaboratively with other students to develop solutions and frequently reflect on their experiences.  They learn how to research and complete long term projects.  Through this process, students become passionate young advocates for themselves and others.  IS289 curriculum infuses these important practical life skills!

I applaud this school for their commitment to inclusion of all people and racial equity at this school.  The Gender Sexuality Alliance club is open to all 7th & 8th graders and meets weekly during lunch.  It is a very popular club among all students and led by a strong & experienced teacher.  Additionally, Facing History framework is woven into the curriculum.  And, the administration is creating a “Race & Equity Team” to address and maintain a focus on race & bias work in the school.  

While the curriculum at the school is thoughtful and empowering, and while overall, the school does a very good job tending to the social/emotional lives of middle school students (Evidenced by classroom time devoted to healthy relationships, healthy media habits, substance abuse, thorough & caring response to 10/31/17 acts of terror at Chambers and West Side Highway) and while many kids seem to graduate with solid friendships, the overall success of IS289 students is limited due to mediocrity in other areas. 

Here are thé negatives: some teacherS RARELY reply to emails (from parents or students) and others take monthS to update students grades in the online grading platform.  Teachers RARELY return graded work with teacher comments or feedback.  These delays or gaps in the “feedback loop of teaching” actually DISempower students and cause frustration, ambivalence and resentment among students, and compromise students learning.  Do teachers not have enough enough time to complete these basic tasks?  

In the past, 6th grade teachers have not provided more challenging work, even when the student asks for it.  This issue was raised to teachers & principal, yet my student saw no change during the 2016-17 school year.  

We are glad to hear the Math curriculum is being revamped — because that is needed.   This past year, 8th grade Algebra took place after school twice a week (last year, it wasn’t even offered AT ALL) and those students must ALSO take 8th grade Math, during the school day.  So, IS 289 demands extra Math hours in the fall of 8th grade just as families are running to visit prospective high schools, and in some cases writing supplemental essays or studying for the SHSAT.   Some parents say the IS289 Math curriculum does not prepare kids for SHSAT.  Some parents say it does not prepare kids for 9th grade Math (again, compared to other D2 middle schools).  MANY families spend extra hours and dollars on private tutoring to score well on the various state/standardized tests (even if student is not taking SHSAT) to bolster their chances of getting into a « top » high school.  

Literacy is based on Teachers College method which works well for some students.  No grammar is taught.  Neither Spelling or vocabulary are not areas of focus.  Again, some families are concerned about being prepared for 9th grade English.  Note, very little time devoted to ELA test prep.  

While PE is strong, Spanish is disappointing (again, NO grammar or verb conjugations are taught) and leaves students ill prepared for Spanish II in high school. 

Also, this school has a dress code and teachers do enforce it (many female students will say it unfairly targets them).  Neither School spirit among students nor parent involvement is particularly strong.  

So, overall, while there are many strengths at this school — teachers and members of the staff DO really CARE about the students —  many students in the 2018-19 class do not seem satisfied with their experience at IS289.   Our hope is there will be more changes (in addition to Math curriculum) at IS289, so the school, staff and future students can fulfill their potential.",0,0,0,2019-09-20T20:08:44,0.75,0.049,0.22899999999999998,0.0,0.484,0.095,0.39799999999999996,0.486,0.042,0.14800000000000002,0.29600000000000004,0.066

One month into 6th grade and my child began complaining that the work was too easy, that there was nothing new or challenging or just simply taught by any of the teachers. Fast forward another year and it's the same story. The teaching is abysmal. Assessments last year and this year are a joke - create an ""artifact""...write down something on a 3x5 index card... and how are these graded you ask! Who knows! In 7th grade ELA, kids are suppose to write every week; so, my child wrote every week. But was anything read or reviewed? Was he provided feedback so that the writing could improve? Was anything sent home so that we could see it? Did the teacher respond to any emails for clarification? NOPE. Same with math and science. Grades aren't posted for months. Responses to emails - you may or may not receive one.  Kids are bullied and no one does anything about it. Several parents have discussed this and yet nothing nothing nothing happens. Neither the Assistant Principal nor the Principal want to deal with these issues at all. 

So, yes, this school looks great from the outside as well as neat,  clean and shiny on the inside. But it's just a hollow shell.

02M289,M.D.,manhattan,Middle,284,"I enjoyed an inviting, warm and peaceful tour today with my 10 year old son at Hudson River.  The children seemed very engaged, attentive, and friendly.  I noticed the school even had a poster that indicated they instill advocacy within the school.  However, during a presentation given by the principal towards the end of the tour I decided to ask a question.  I asked "" Are the children accessible to an avenue within the school which promotes a mindset of being of service to their community, and society not just on a broad scale, such as within the curriculum,  but a day to day level within the communities they are closely amongst?""  The principal responded very kindly, it's not mandatory, and began explaining how social activism is integrated within the curriculum, which I saw on the pamphlet and I was very pleased to see.  Then she expressed how hard it would be to find an organization that would welcome 100 middleschoolers to volunteer!  In conclusion, what this showed me about Hudson River was this school has never thought or believed they could achieve incorporating community service and volunteering as an essential part of the social aspect of education by establishing a group within the school that would promote and allow the children to have access to voluntarily offer themselves (since it's not mandatory) to be of service in their city to different organizations in New York.  As a society we can do better within the school system to instill the importance of serving others as much as possible!

What we learn in 6th grade is so laughable, multiplication, fractions, ratios, etc.. all that I've learned in 4th to 5th grade! Sometimes the teachers just let us do whatever we want, and the hallways are NEVER safe. People are constantly fighting for their lockers to get to class on time, and sometimes the weaker kids are late for people that are casually playing around. I also have seen several kids getting bullied, with no one standing up for them, even though in Advisory, we try to stop bullying.( Clearly none of the lessons have stuck onto the kid's heads).

02M289,noname,manhattan,Middle,284,"Right now I'm in 8th grade in this school and so far, I don't regret coming here. There's a music program where you can play classical instruments and have two concerts       -one in the winter and one in the summer- and you start learning Spanish in 7th grade. I think the best year is 8th because all the teachers in this grade is very nice and you can joke and talk about other things with them. But I struggled a lot during my first two years. In 7th grade, you have to write 3 entries a week in literacy. The entries have to be 2-3 pages long and by the end of the week, you should have at about 10 pages of work. The entries can be about anything you want. I find this ridiculous because it's suppose to help you with your state ela exam but it did nothing to me other than make me get bad grades (I didn't do so well back then). It got way better for me in 8th grade because you don't have to write the entries and instead you do work that actually matter and is useful like drafting poems and article works. You have to do a lot of reflection work and you have to have a portfolio starting from 6th grade. You don't actually learn much during Spanish and from what I see, most kids act up and disrespect the Spanish teacher the most. The food here actually isn't that bad and there's water so that's nice. We also have art, but it's not that interesting. If you have music, you don't get to have as much time in P.E. or small groups. You also have to lead your parents teacher conference (depending on who your advisory teacher is). There's also coaching, where a teacher is your coach and you both decide on what goals you have and what you want to improve on. But there are some kids who never did get coach for a while. I only got two coaching sessions last year and that was towards the end of the year. But I did get coach in 6th grade and my coach now isn't bad.
 One interesting thing you might want to know if you are thinking about applying to this school is that we (the whole 8th grade) hate the 7th graders. Most of them are annoying and rude, cursing and disrespecting anyone and everyone. There's also rumors that a kid in 7th grade smoked one of those e-cigs in math class. A fight also broke out last year when I was in 7th grade and them in 6th. But that's only in the 7th grade now. The 6th graders aren't that bad.

02M289,Mikaela,manhattan,Middle,284,"IS 289 is bursting with potential—a beautiful library, some great teachers, a lovely atmosphere.... But it falls short in ways that are extremely perplexing and that we're still trying to figure out even after 3 years there. The administration seems to place more emphasis on cultivating a sweet appearance and innovating and implementing progressive ideas while neglecting serious holes in some basics. Teachers label students (academic ability, and, I'm afraid, even by race) —still shocking to me in 2013 and in a progressive school in Tribeca—creating a box for them that often becomes
impossible to break out of.  This becomes a big factor in 8th grade when the A group—students with averages of 90 and above—are separated out (!) and encouraged to apply to the best schools, and the B group (the remaining students) all the rest. Teachers are often unclear with their expectations for student work, so that, for example, students might be marked off for not doing enough drafts of an assignment when the number of drafts was not specified. The school's macro-grading system can be perplexing, while not giving helpful insight into the bigger picture: Think losing weight by weighing daily and counting ounces. Having students evaluate themselves at parent-teacher conferences has its value but not when helpful insight and adjustments from the teachers themselves are
lacking. And group projects also have their value but can hold some kids back and/or overburden others—better to have a balance. If students are out sick they are expected to get their assignments from other students (teachers don't post assignments electronically)—not a reliable system for 11, 12, and, even, 13 years olds, and anxiety provoking for some. Overall I think the school best for more-linear middle-of-the-road-type students; it doesn't seem to know what to do with outside-the-box thinkers. Good progressive learning is built from the inside out and based on a solid foundation that recognizes and encourages the strengths of its individual students (witness Bank Street). I'm not sure why IS 289 hasn't caught on or that its emphasis has been so outside in. It has all the potential to soar. But it needs to recognize that so do each and every one of its students, regardless of race or grade point average.",7,0,0,2013-10-06T00:58:00,0.75,0.049,0.22899999999999998,0.0,0.484,0.095,0.39799999999999996,0.486,0.042,0.14800000000000002,0.29600000000000004,0.066

You can't simply put a group of kids on a boat in the middle of the ocean  and tell them learn how to get ashore.   I believe that the DOE must be on top on their schools and a more rigorous inspections and more meaningful testing.",3,0,0,2012-02-26T01:34:02,0.75,0.049,0.22899999999999998,0.0,0.484,0.095,0.39799999999999996,0.486,0.042,0.14800000000000002,0.29600000000000004,0.066

I like the fact that 7th and 8th graders get out-lunch, so we don't have to stay in the school all-day. Out lunch is safe because we know the neighborhood well and we have boundaries. Before out-lunch started for us 7th graders, our homeroom teachers took us on a quick walk around the neighborhood to tell us about where the boundaries were and some places we could go. Our homeroom teachers are really fun during homeroom because after we go over what we need to do for homework in our planners, we get to share interesting things that happened during the day and upcoming events.

The 8th grade Math teacher was amazing though, she was so organized and everything, she gave everyone a fair grade. Though I do criticize it's collaboration method in which some kids just don't care about their work or their grades. Those who do generally are the ones who take over group work and yet teachers don't punish or even give a little thought to the fact that those who have not done anything are those who get the same grades as their partner. It's completely unfair. Also, as my school years passed I have noticed that the school children have become very aggressive and uncivilized. I remember yelling at someone who stealing my friends Itouch even though nothing could have been done to have physical evidence that he had stole it. There was also a social hierarchy when I was there. Those who are loud and disruptive aren't the ones who are shun by the students in the school. Those who are, are the ones who are annoyed or try to take a stand against this power or image of ""coolness"". Teachers usually don't see the situations like that. The students who were generally causing most trouble, lie to the teachers to no extent. The teachers don't really care about this. Those who were the general population of hardworking students, who didn't necessarily like the loud and rowdy crowd had absolutely no power. I'm pretty sure the second reason why I liked the 8th grade math teacher was because shes the only one who took a stand and actually punished the kids. (amazing) This school is not for everyone, though it may have better programs than most schools. (also, I'm sorry but the homework was absolutely nothing. There was so little, I mean like I'm sure a 6th grader considers 1 hour of homework ""long"". In reality, you could have finished the writing homework in 10 minutes and the math in 5)P.S.

MNS spends very little real class time on Math.I see many students from MNS struggling with Math in Middle School.What little math they learn takes too long to calculate in the real world.A tutor must be hired so this long formulas to calculate problems with lots of equations can be changed to quick solving solutions, The principal, Sharon Hill, is not involved as she should be with new teachers and class cirriculum.She never sits in on classes.Last year a new teacher had many parents strongly complain about their 5th grade report cards due to the fact that she did not recieve any direction .I feel she should be much more involved.""</p>",1,0,0,2008-10-10T05:50:28,1.0,0.023,0.17,0.0,0.092,0.002,0.081,0.10800000000000001,0.03,0.091,0.713,0.055999999999999994

""The parent body is full of energy and committed to helping the administration and teachers with fundraising and in-class projects and field trips. The teachers and administrators care deeply and passionately about the academics, the students and the community at large. On an academic level, I have found that MNS often performs better (or on par) in state exams - than PS 6 and Lower Lab, the local G&amp;T school, and other 'peer' schools. It is interesting that MNS's state math scores are higher than their ELA scores (particularly since MNS does pride itself on its literacy and writing programs) but when I compared this to other schools in District 2 and 3, I found this trend to be the same. Academically, I do believe MNS does a good job with the children. You do find that teacher quality varies, with some teachers very strong and others weaker and less experienced. But, you find this everywhere. Some teachers are incredibly skilled at differentiating classwork across student capabilities, and others are less adept. While many parents (myself included) do tutor their children, I have found this to be the case at other public and private schools as well. I'm not sure that MNS parents are more likely to have tutors than children at other schools. Overall, MNS is a wonderful school.

""I find that the lower grades work extremely well, teaching the children both to read and write and to love literature. TERC math also does a good job in the lower grades, helping children to understand the underpinnings of mathematical reasoning. I am less pleased with MNS in the upper grades. TERC math in particular is a problem. My older daughter left MNS with a 4 on the standardized tests, but unable to calculate except in a slow and laborious manner. She went on to a traditional middle school where math was a huge struggle for her in 6th grade. After many thousands of dollars of tutoring, she now gets excellent grades in math and was recently admitted to Bronx Science. Unfortunately, I feel her achievement was largely despite rather than because of her math education at MNS. I believe the reading and creative writing at MNS remains strong in the upper grades. I would like to see more explicit instruction on the mechanics of spelling, grammar, etc. Not all children just ""pick these up"" as they go along. I also find that the most advanced kids are very bored. They are ready to move along to more sophisticated literary analysis, and the teachers are too overburdened to individualize to this extent. I would also prefer to see more focus on content and less on process in the 4th and 5th grades. The science program is exceptional! It's the best I've seen in an elementary school.""  </P>

I was left with pain in my back and legs. My doctor advised me to use the elevator and limit walking. One day I was having a flare up and the nurse wasn’t there during her lunch break and didn’t have a substitute. I went to the nurses office with a student that had an allergic reaction, with a throat closing and another student with a high fever. The elevator stopped at the second floor (where we were) with the school Dean inside and I told him I have a back injury and I showed him my bright red pass and he told me to take the stairs. I told him while the elevator closed I almost broke my spine and head so taking the stairs isn’t an option for my injury and he didn’t care. Also I had two students that were severely sick and nobody even cared not even the nurses assistant who was watching tv in the office. While a student struggling to breath and the other student gets very light headed and I cry on the floor in pain.

He asked me to clarify: Did I “mean trash-talking while playing sports?” I said “no, like fist fights.” He again looked very confused and said “no....I haven’t seen any fights. I don’t know where that would happen.” My intuition tells me he wasn’t coached to lie, but genuinely had never seen this type of behavior in his school. I then asked around to a couple other parents and they said that because the grades are split up into 3 bungalows each, you become very insulated within your specific bungalow.

I have not posted any prior reviews because there are so many problems with this school that I did not know where to begin. Keep in mind that while the majority of students panned 75 Morton on the surveys last year, the negative opinions are not shared by 100% of the students. Students who do not love this school will not volunteer as tour guides to promote it! Any student who is oblivious to the fights must not be paying much attention. Fights last year broke out in the hallways and at recess. My kids witnessed and heard about fights between kids within their classes and from different bungalows. A fight actually broke out in one of the classes during the NY state ELA test. The students are not the problem. It's bad policy. However, I think the bigger problem is the anti-academic attitude of the administration. Although they will never admit it, they deliberately impede the progress of the top students. It is rooted in their belief that all students need to be equal. Since it is not feasible to make the struggling students catch up if all the students are moving forward, they need to hold back those who are too far ahead in order to help close the gap. However, many parents who can afford it hire private tutors outside the school so that their kids continue getting 4's on the state tests. 75 Morton needs to come with a long, detailed warning label, but instead, the administration aggressively covers up the negatives.

02M297,Lawrence Chachere,manhattan,Middle,561,"The specific request was to allow 6th and 7th grade students who are strong in math the option to work on material 1 year ahead of their grade level. This is hardly an unreasonable request, since more than half the middle schools in the US allow this. Even though more than 150 6th-grade families at 75 Morton signed a petition last year in support of allowing students to work ahead in math, the school administration refused to allow it. Their reasoning was that doing so would go against their 'mission of diversity and inclusion.' It is unclear to me how denying a student an opportunity to excel makes a school less diverse. As a result, students who are strong in math sit in classrooms at Morton not learning anything, and the school administration, plus some Morton parents, think there is nothing wrong with this.


However, as I stated elsewhere, 'pedagogy' is not the only problem with Morton. The following response from last year's quality survey sums it up: 37% of students say that most students at their school treat each other with respect. (Q1d) - It's very hard to find a middle school in District 2 where this percentage was worse, (i.e., only City Knoll is lower.) The classroom behavior results on this survey were also not positive, and were unfavorable compared to both the district and city averages. This isn't because Morton is a new school with growing pains. It is because the students at this school all realize that they will not have to face any consequences for disruptive behavior.",2,0,6,2019-11-20T15:44:08,0.75,0.034,0.23,0.006999999999999999,0.321,0.068,0.242,0.086,0.094,0.23,0.545,0.163

Lab Middle School is an excellent school for students who

there are a few teachers who are compassionate and helpful, many teachers,
including the special education teachers, seem to lack psychological
insight and a true understanding of the needs of students with ADHD or LD.  For instance, my son was told by a special education teacher  “There will always be distractions in life.  It is up to you to ignore them”.   He was not then given tools to help achieve this goal.  Would you tell someone who is hard of hearing that he needs to listen better?  Trust me, if my son could ignore distractions, he would.  My husband and I had to frequently intervene and advocate on our son’s behalf.  I talked to other parents, who also felt unsupported at Lab making for a stressful, frustrating experience.

Chanceor your comment lacks taste, instead of putting down the children you
feel are inadequate to attend New
York City Lab Middle School, perhaps you should
volunteer your time, and work with the school on provide tutoring for children
who might be struggling academically. Let your voice be heard in a positive light
and inspire children to be the best that they can be…remind them that they are
not alone and should NEVER be afraid to ask for assistance, remind them that
caring responsible adults would never, ever, make them feel bad for attending a
well ranking school because they need extra HELP with the curriculum! 

Besides
all children have different learning styles and the aim should be to identify each
child’s learning method and a curriculum built to suit their needs.  Think about it, if all shoe stores sold only a
size 8 but you wore a size 7 or 9, should you be forced to wear the size 8
shoe?

 year old granddaughter. One of the requirements for the court to grant 
this is for the 8 year old child (who can hear) to learn sign language. 
As the grandparent is impoverished, she is unable to afford sign 
classes. We are trying to prevent this child from getting lost in the 
foster care system. Could you please advise me as to where the child can
 receive free sign classes or a scholarship to pay for them? If you 
wish, I may also be reached at my office at (201) 599-1049. Thank you 
for your assistance.Cordially,Edward Tucker, LCSWSocial Worker

We also celebrate reading by allowing kids to check out lots of books, and honoring them when they read ALL of a beloved author, a topic of interest, or of a series. The Reggio Emilio approach grows into inquiry-based learning in the upper grades which highlights creativity and problem-solving within the structure of solid, assessment-based phases of inquiry as standardized in the NYC Information Fluency Continuum.

And so we applied, even though my son didn't have performing experience except singing in choir. Mr. Ryan was for real: the school is packed with the loveliest, most ""Hey, kids, let's put on a show!"" children I've ever seen. Some have been in Broadway shows or on TV; others have no professional experience. They get first-rate training in dance, vocal, and acting, plus optional free after-school classes like hip-hop dance, movie club, and sketch comedy.

Our PTA pledged $28K toward the Mainstage production for 2016. The total budget for the production was higher. The students involved in the show raised the additional funds necessary which were deposited into the PTA bank account (from which all payments for the show were made). The show came in on-budget: the 28k plus the additional fundraising. The box office and concession income outperformed the projected income for the show and reportedly covered the entirety of the PTA's budgeted pledge. So while this PTA did budget quite a lot of money to the Mainstage production, the income offsets the investment. This year's production had a cast of 40 students representing a significant percentage of our school's small size. The production is open to all high schoolers. The Principal has reportedly expressed his conviction that a musical is the art form that allows our students from all majors to compete for roles. Competition is fierce to be cast, and true ""triple threats"" are most likely to win coveted roles.

02M408,u parente,manhattan,Middle,123,"This is not entirely accurate and sugar coats the events of the year. 

 At the beginning of the school year the principal announced doe budget cuts which resulted in cancelling some classes with the arts partners with the hope that doe funding would be restored perhaps in January.   Yet in February due to the mainstage production which casts 90% musical theater kids, the principal assumed many line items from the PTA budget to insure the main stage was not jeopardized.  His view being that's what attracts families to the school. The so called workshops to help kids prepare for auditions was a ruse and in theory all kids had the opportunity to be cast. In fact, the workshops were poorly attended largely due to lack of notice and the perception that kids would not be cast unless they were musical theater. Further, one might suggest that if a fundraiser was run it would benefit the entire school, not 40 kids and it would make sense that monies would go to support the budget items that the school was taking over from the PTA budget. If the school suddenly has funds, why wouldn't classes be added back that were removed earlier in the year? None of it makes any sense. 

I am friendly with the embattled president and treasurer, both have verbally attacked and defamed viciously in their efforts at trying to follow rules and in trying to straighten out the mess they were handed. They have tried to get some focus on academics, yet are dismissed on every front.  College placement is interesting, some of the schools include PACE, SUNY Pottsdam, LIU, SUNY Erie, SUNY Purchase, Point Park University, Manhattan College, Rutgers, Montclair, and Delaware State.

PPAS is not doing anything unusual here. Auditions are open to all students, but kids who study musical theater will have an edge in auditions by nature of their interest in musical theater.  You're making a mountain out of a molehill. Also, it seems to me that there are a lot of schools that focus on academics with a side of arts. LaGuardia is being criticized for hammering down on academics harder than they need (both in admissions and demanding AP classes for most kids). There are so many NYC kids who would rather focus deeply on the arts and deal with what they must academically. What is the precise problem with academics? Is it the lack of AP offerings? Is it the teacher quality? Why not just let PPAS be what LaGuardia used to be - a place where students get to focus on their passions while the school gives them what they need to graduate.

A teacher, whom I highly respect, has admitted that exhibitions are the best preparation for college that any student can go through, and I agree. The exhibitions push our creativity by letting us chose our own topic, yet also push some students out of their comfort zone since we have to present our findings to a panel at the very end of the process. 
In comparison to regents, I think exhibitions are not only beneficial for our communication skills, but also our problem solving and research skills, qualities that regent tests simply cannot offer. Since we do exhibitions instead of regents, it also allows our curriculum to be more liberating, and not groomed to ace a test. For instance, in physics class (usually taken in 11th grade) we not only learn about physics material but also the stereotypes and injustices that are observed in the science field, such as medical racism and gender inequality.
In addition, although some comments are saying that our teachers may not always be the best, the majority are outstanding and regardless of the teacher's teaching style, you're bound to learn something in each class. 
However, the one thing I can never get used to at SOF are the stairs!

There is a decrease in preparation and the higher-ups seemingly hate every grade more and more. With the exhibition process, our replacement for regents, they changed the process to where we only meet with our sponsor once a month. Ridiculous considering it is supposed to be a 25-page college-level thesis paper. Making friends can be a challenge. A lot of middle school students end up staying and already know each other. Either you find a group to hang with or you're an outcast. The transition from 10th to 11th is ROUGH. Please be prepared, especially if you or your child partakes in a number of after-school activities. DO NOT TAKE MANDARIN. The teacher does not know how to teach and is extremely biased towards students who already know the language. Most people fail the class multiple times. Honestly this school is 100% a sink or swim situation. You will either thrive or miserably fail. I could go on about it... but I won't. I do regret going here.

02M413,n.a,manhattan,Middle,304,"I feel like now is a good time to post this review since I graduated 2 years ago. I never liked this school. I don’t know why I never transferred out (I honestly regret staying here). Personally, I thought some of the teachers here were rude and disrespectful. I remember one time this teacher accused me of writing a bad review on here because it had my name on it, but I never wrote that kind of review. That teacher told the principal on me and I explained that it wasn’t me and I had no idea what he was talking about. So I went up to this website to find the review and when reading it, I know it obviously wasn’t me. The principal didn’t believe me (I just had this feeling he didn’t believe my words..). The teachers here just accuse students like that just because it had my name written as the review..maybe it was someone using my name so people wouldn’t know who really wrote it.
Anyways, I never liked this school because personally for me, it was hard making friends. I would say I only had two close friends and the rest I would say as acquaintances. I thought the students at this school were annoying and also rude. 
People complain about their grades at this school but the work at this school isn’t hard if you compare it to other high schools in nyc. What’s sad is that this school doesn’t teach you enough for college. The stuff I am learning in college, I should’ve learned in high school but unfortunately I didn’t learn it (especially the math curriculum). This school is literally middle school 2.0. 
Of course, some of the teachers here are nice and super helpful. The only teachers I actually liked was my 11th and 12th grade history and english teachers. I felt that those classes were more challenging and the teachers are really helpful and encouraging towards students.
I don’t recommend coming to this school, because it won’t help you in college. and some teachers can be pretty rude accusing people like how he accused me for something i didn’t do.",0,0,0,2019-11-21T00:25:31,0.75,0.013000000000000001,0.247,0.0,0.426,0.069,0.342,0.23399999999999999,0.115,0.21100000000000002,0.336,0.059000000000000004

Asking for $1000 - we do not ask for that amount - is a lot of money but asking for $30 a week for the whole school year (as but one example) is far less painful.

We will continue to be able to accept students from throughout the city for ninth grade as well.

Below are a few things that make Quest a great school.

     We are committed to real-world learning. At the end of each semester students do not take classes. For a full week, they work in small groups with a teacher on a design challenges which have been featured in Edutopia and the Huffington Post.
     We have a strongly committed staff. Of the 71 members of our staff, 70 are returning.
     We have great access to technology. Through a $180,000 grant, we are able to provide each teacher with a full laptop cart.
     We are an inclusive school. We're proud to be an InsideSchools pick for Special Education. 
     We push our students academically. All 8th graders take the Regents exams in Algebra and Earth Science. We are one of only two schools in District 2 that did this last year.

02M422,QuestFan,manhattan,Middle,167,"I want to sing the praises of Quest to Learn. My family is at the end of a long road. We have been at Quest since the very beginning. My oldest son, now a college sophomore, entered as part of Quest's first sixth grade class in 2009. My younger son entered the school two years later and is now an upper school senior, already accepted to the college of his choice. Throughout these last years, Quest has been brilliant. Granted, not without its stumbles, but in the end, each time, strength has won out. My older boy had an IEP when he came to the school. He was so shy, felt so other, he could not even look teachers or peers in the eye. Every year we got calls from his pre-school and then his elementary school, there's something wrong with your son. He was the one who first became aware of this new school and its unusual education premise. Under the guidance of the remarkable teachers and the school's innovative educational paradigm, we saw a complete turnaround in his sheer enthusiasm for the classroom, and even more important his understanding of himself. In the end he graduated valedictorian, and he went to college with the most valuable of lifetime gifts: he had been taught to problem solve, think, and reason. This is the mandate of Quest to Learn, what sets it apart. There may be schools more rigorous, more bent to test taking and SATs. If you want your kid to be a calculous whiz, maybe Quest is not your first place (although math and science are super strong here). But if you want a child free of the pressure cooker mentality, strong in self-confidence, able to work seamlessly with others, and a tenacious self-learner, Quest is the place. The staff is nothing short of miraculous. Starting with the principal, Nick Jurman, the fantastic, enthusiastic, unbridled faculty, and the school's effervescent, dynamo, parent coordinator, Kathy Ringrose, Quest to Learn is an oasis in an often confounding New York City public school quagmire. This is a place a child can be him or herself, without qualm, without fear. If looking for a high school of superb heart and promise, Quest to Learn may be the very solution. My highest recommendation.",0,0,0,2018-03-13T21:45:01,0.75,0.054000000000000006,0.287,0.006,0.72,0.21,0.635,0.156,0.251,0.43700000000000006,0.126,0.267

They are women and men who have a passion for an innovative instruction model.  Their commitment to the ""Quest"" way of things along with their authentic compassion for the students is something that cannot be measured, it can only be experienced.  Once something like this is experienced, it is lifelong indelible.  Reflect for a moment on a teacher that made a difference in your life.  At Quest, my son has a collection of teachers and staff (including the principal) that have been meaningful to him.  We are very pleased with what Quest has provided for our son and are grateful to the dedicated leadership, staff and teachers that have valued and supported him and inspiried his intellectual growth.

I love how diverse our student body is, and I love how frequently I see students of all levels collaborate to support each other's learning. As a special education teacher in 11th and 12th grade ELA classrooms, I feel privileged to get to co-construct my curriculum with my amazing, sensitive, and compassionate general education co-teachers. It is a pleasure to watch students of all levels and backgrounds grapple with sophisticated ideas and learn how to think systematically through the work of thinkers I never encountered until college. I'm excited to work with one of my co-teachers this year to launch the Quest to Learn Writing Center, an after school program which will enlist our strongest student-writers to help peers and underclassmen plan, revise, edit, and proofread papers. My biggest hope since the Upper School's inception has been to empower students to take real ownership of the school community and pass on leadership roles to one another as they leave. I see this happening more and more every year. When I imagine the soul-crushing, cutthroat competition some of our higher level students might face in more homogenous, segregated schools, I think that they are lucky to get to focus on their thinking and on communicating with students of all levels here at Quest.

02M422,jkryslur,manhattan,Middle,167,"Now that my son's nearly done with 8th grade, I suppose it's time for an update. Let me start by saying my son has an IEP and is not a great student OR an easy kid to deal with. During his first two years at Quest he had a handful of talented teachers who knew how to deal with parents and Special Ed kids ... sadly they are either gone, or in the High School. The Parent Coordinator here is a super-star and IMHO, the glue holding the last shreds of this failing institution together. The after-school program (Manhattan Youth) is very weak to say the least and the guidance staff is highly competent, but severely over-worked. My son fits in well here at Quest, he's definitely found his place socially, but has his education be stellar..not so much. Has my experience as a parent been positive... again, not usually.
         With a staggering 30% special ed population, this school should have a far more talented, better trained and innovative special ed staff. I am a middle school teacher and I get it...Middle School is a battlefield especially with a ""quirky"" mostly non-academic population like most Quest kids, but that being the case,  the curriculum and overall instruction should be FAR more innovative as originally promised. Seeing that the school never really bothered to offer test-prep, (even when it was specifically promised) certainly they didn't give much of a damn about state tests, so why not provide the groundbreaking technology-driven gaming methodology we were promised? 
     There were glimmers of hope... mostly in 6th grade, but the promise never really materialized and by the time 8th grade rolled around my kid was bored,angry and discouraged. Alex ended up in a school for ""tech kids"" with NO technology in his curriculum AT ALL... instead, 8th grade parents were force-fed an advanced Spanish curriculum that most of us neither wanted or needed. School Elections and student celebrations almost disappeared by 8th grade as well. An 8th grade trip promised since orientation never transpired...lots of missed opportunities and broken promises here. The initial parent computer portal was switched at some point and the new one was never fully adopted by the faculty, or explained to the parents, (That training would have been useful for the PTA to provide!) essentially cutting off our primary access to day-to-day information and creating a lot of frustration for kids and adults.
       Academic rigor was never really present, with follow-through and consistency lacking pretty much across-the-board in the classroom and via administration. Little homework, lots of work-sheets and endlessly repeated content (How many times do kids need to ""study"" bullying, or  the civil rights movement?). The one traditional strategy the kids really DID need was not taught... a solid writing essay writing format they can use in all of their subjects (some use the acronym  RACE).  This is avery effective tool for struggling writers and standardized test-taking. 
           One bright-spot, is the twice-annual Boss Level projects. These give a glimpse of how the Q2L school concept was initially envisioned. If I were running the show, I would have Boss Levels three times per year, adding the week before Spring Break as the  perfect time to unwind after all of the State Exams to engage in nontraditional group work.
           So the BIG question is why has this noble experiment failed?   First of all, this is a non-screened school, so unlike many District 2 Middle Schools, it becomes a a dumping ground for special ed kids and discipline problems. The only way that can change is if the school  A.) becomes screened  (highly unlikely) OR  B) they become MUCH better and dealing with discipline. 
         Next, much has been said about the principal and while Im not a huge fan, I don't think she is inept or evil, but mostly overworked. I honestly don't know how the DOE expects one set of administrators to run an already struggling middle school AND start-up a high school at the same time! I don't know why the IOP disappeared , or if they're returning, but I'm sure their exit didn't help matter much. 
          Third and most importantly...a flawed curriculum. I was engaged in conversations with the administration about my grave concerns about Quests ""fluffy"" (IOP mandated ) curriculum early-on in 6th grade.  My biggest issue being way way way too much ""wellness"", a course clearly envisioned for low-income/ inner-city kids ...maybe not the best fit for the typical D2 demographic. My child really doesn't need 1-2 periods a week of nutrition or bullying education when he could be taking art, music, or hmm I dunno maybe technology !!!!!  This combined with random study-halls (who has Study Halls these days..NO ONE!) and Home Base ...yet more BS, there seemed to be MANY MANY wasted hours in the school week.  
    Looking at Q2L'S High School retention statistics it is clear that Quest is not making it as a traditional school OR as a progressive school, so ground-up changes are greatly needed. Perhaps the future Quest needs to be a portfolio school like ICE? The powers-that-be need to take a long,  hard look at the curriculum and the demographic is serves.
      It's a shame Alex couldn't stay at Quest for High School, because that was our plan...but how could he with all that we've seen? We went to the Quest High School open house and it all sounded great...a film and video curriculum in cooperation with NYU but as they say... ""Fool me once ...shame on you. Fool me twice...shame on me!""

Dear NYS Governor Andrew Cuomo and NYC parents! 

The situation with my child was resolved with a reasonable solution thanks to the speedy intervention of our wonderful NYS Governor, Andrew Cuomo! We did not get all we wanted from the NYC DOE, but I am satisfied and looking forward to a better future in my child's last school years. Now my son  is going to have ""fresh start"" in a different school next week. It was a hard battle and I endured a lot of stress and my health significantly deteriorated. My son suffered the worse - the hospitalization as the result of a retaliation game played against our family by some ill-spirited, off-agenda officials at Q2L in response to my justified and long ignored complaints to the NYC DOE. My son's future is the most important issue in all of this and it has been the ultimate goal for me. I did everything possible to provide him with an acceptable educational environment in a very limited choice of relatively good schools our city politicians can offer to NYC kids. 

I would like to thank my fantastic friends and my son's wonderful doctors who helped enormously to resolve this situation in the best interest of my child. I also deeply appreciate the gracious help of U.S. Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, the Compliance Team Attorneys at US DOE Office for Civil Rights and other U.S. and NYS officials who found time and willingness to bring to a peace-filled end to the viciously active 2-year long circle of violation of my child's rights; my parental rights; along with a cruel war of retaliation and outright discrimination organized against a small family of the single dad and his child by Q2L principal and some of her obedient and shamefully misguided supporters.  

I also would like to thank Q2L's parent's coordinator and my son's school guidance counselor for their kindness, professionalism and support during a very difficult turmoil our family endured in the last few weeks  of intense battles against illegal actions by the Q2L principal and the unlawful inaction of NYC DOE.  

Governor Cuomo received my statements along with all the complaints to NYC DOE that was been ignored for the last two years on Tuesday of last week while my son was still in a hospital clinic and was under observation and with no school to return to, because to return to Q2L was impossible considering he was being targeted by some staff members. The same day, the Governor's administration contacted NYC DOE and finally a process started to move in a positive direction. I am very thankful. My son is grateful and our family unit is content with the resolution.

I wish Quest to Learn a successful future. In my view, the school has mostly wonderful teachers. My hopes that Q2L administration change its course and instead of punishing a parent and his child for criticism on this forum and in the form of justified complaints in search for resolution from upper level of government, for any family desire to implement their student and parental rights would look for communication and compromise to avoid such tragedies that my family was forced to experience this school year.

01-19-2016 

Dear HK mom,

This morning I discovered that Insideschools.org deleted my appeal to parent's community in this page seeking help from other parents in order to help my child who is at one of NYC hospitals now because he is a victim of unlawful actions by Q2l principal along with her accomplice and illegal inaction by all levels of NYC DOE management, including High Schools Superintendent Donald Coyners himself.

NYC DOE for over two month refused (finally talks started yesterday at NYC DOE main office on Chambers street thanks to intervention of NYS government) to grant transfer my son from the toxic environment at Q2L to a different school disregarding my son’s doctors’ requests, systematic violation of ESL mandates, wicked acts of retaliation by Q2L school principal and some of her staff, safety concerns, etc.

I can’t disclose to the public the reasons for my son’s hospitalization due to child’s privacy concerns, but it is a result of a cruel act of retaliation by a recently hired school official, who tried to destroy our family life.

In order to transfer my son I needed reasons, besides a doctor’s medical advice. I have a number of issues with Q2L school that the NYC DOE has ignored for two years in a row, and until yesterday was punishing me and my son for filing a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at U.S. Department of Education along with other actions in order to protect my child's rights.

As a general matter the First Amendment prohibits discrimination based on the content or viewpoint of an individual’s speech. For example, prohibiting citizens from criticizing school officials would be impermissible because it would be a discrimination on the basis of content, allowing praise of government officials but not allowing criticism. 

In other words, the First Amendment, above all else, rejects actions that favor some ideas or viewpoints while excluding others.

The First Amendment comes into play when (like in this situation) a parent faces retaliation because of his or her criticism.

As Supreme Court Justice Brennan once stated: “The constitutionally protected right to speak out on governmental affairs would be meaningless if it did not extend to statements expressing criticism of governmental officials”. 

Nevertheless, it is possible that a short-lived posting of appeal seeking help from other parents that was undemocratically deleted also played its role in breaking this unlawful and vicious pattern of stonewalling my appeals to NYC DOE. My son should be out of hospital very soon and must go back to a different school after what happened at Q2L. 

...Perhaps New York is really two cities rather than one. There is one small city populated by the rich and fortunate, who manage to send their children to the best public and private schools available. Then there is the larger city of the unfortunate and deprived of their basic rights, whose children are routinely assigned to failing schools and locked up there like my child, frozen into a life of low expectations and meager opportunity.

The widespread sense of resignation serves as a cynical excuse for a system that lacks the political will and the professional know-how to provide a decent education for all, or even most, children in the city…

Well, parents tried to find out some information with regards to what happened from the principal during PTA meeting, that followed soon after the stabbing incident. Jen Rygalski killed the
discussion with her usual empty excuses, this  time citing privacy concerns and  having not enough information from other schools in the buildings since she  doesn't have good relationships with the other principals, as she stated, etc. In my view, she didn't even show care or concern about the episode to make parents comfortable. 
I have to say, she has good command of English, and she is very clever with the policy of deceiving parents by giving them empty promises such as: ""I’m going to look into revisiting this issue"", “I will give you response later,” etc.  This terms  she often uses regarding  most problems the school has during these toothless PTA meetings and beyond. For second year now, she been killing ideas such as providing Q2L kids the ability to use the pool in the building, or getting teachers on-board for some important subjects that are missing at Q2L.. Unfortunately, present PTA leadership believes that their agenda only relates to fundraising and as result my appeals to PTA leadership for help with Jen Rygalski's refusal to follow clear laws and regulations concerning my child education have all been ignored.

02M422,Queens_Parent,manhattan,Middle,167,"Regarding use of the pool, from what I know about other schools in other buildings that have had similar issues, the problem is this:  For a school in a shared building to use the pool, that school must have its own gym teacher who is certified to teach swimming.  If a school does not have such a certified teacher, its students may not use the pool in the building.  Please note that when the majority of the DOE buildings with pools were built, there was only ONE school in the entire building.  Thus, finding the funding for one gym teacher among many, with the certification, was not difficult.  Fast forward to today, with several small schools sharing a building.  Each small school has to either provide its own swim teacher (and librarian, art teacher, music teacher, etc.) or agree to share a position (not so easy if a building has charters as well as public schools).   Some of your concerns about Quest seem to stem from this funding issue.  It is not something that most principals or PTAs are able to overcome; unfortunately, I would note that this is also a problem regarding science labs, as with the breaking up of campuses into multiple schools, some schools now lack access to a vented lab,  which is necessary for teaching Regents science classes.  Your best bet may be to have your school try to reach out to the other schools in the building, to see whether it is possible to share a swim instructor.",0,0,2,2015-12-07T00:22:29,0.75,0.054000000000000006,0.287,0.006,0.72,0.21,0.635,0.156,0.251,0.43700000000000006,0.126,0.267

02M422,Alex Parent,manhattan,Middle,167,"I am sure ""2QLparent"" who defend the failing schools so hard in this forum is from the administration.  
This person attacks every criticism; call parents and Q2L kids "" crazy"", ""poor person"" etc... However,  it is of no value and certainly without offering option for thought.  How can progress be achieved when people who want to speak out are abused or not allowed to speak their mind or even present the facts without been put down in the nasty manner.  
I  see and hear about so much bullying and deferent forms of phobias going on at the school when I get chance to check my child’s group messages with other school students  and while talking to another parents during PTA meetings, including homophobia in its most ugly forms.  I raised these issues with school administration since last school year and after been ignored  I appealed to deferent levels of government.  I asked, repeatedly,  for special classes or mandatory seminars for all the students at Q2L, where they can be taught how wrong it is to act in such abusive manner and to have such derogatory views on deferent social groups of our society. This school should at least tell kids that this kind of behavior and views are amoral and  against the federal and state laws. Unfortunately, my appeals to NYC DOE and to local council members brought no results. Not as much as even a written  response. I guess this school runs as a bastion of ignorance and lawlessness.
NYC government has no way to interfere, or just doesn't want to bother, that is why the parents need to place pressure at this forum  and  where it also needed to change this appalling situation at Q2L.

Once again I want to bring up conclusion below, since I presume it is  the explanation for such negative phenomenon NYC children and their parents have to suffer from:
"".. Academic failure in New York City is widespread and accepted. It is the norm rather than the exception. Perhaps one reason that politicians, policy makers, and opinion leaders find failure in the system so tolerable is that hardly any of them have children in schools that appear or belong on the SURR (Schools Under Registration Review) list, and, in fact, only a small minority even have children who attend public schools. Perhaps New York is really two cities rather than one. There is one small city populated by the fortunate, who manage to send their children to the best public and private schools available. Then there is the larger city of the unfortunate whose children are routinely assigned to failing schools, frozen into a life of low expectations and meager opportunity.
There is a hushed assumption among many of those who live in the first city that those in the second are doing as well as might be expected. The implicit suggestion is that the causes of failure can be traced to the student or the family rather than the school or the system. Such resignation to failure falls lame in the face of the many academically successful public and non-public schools that thrive in the midst of poverty and social deprivation along side many failing institutions. The widespread sense of resignation serves as a cynical excuse for a system that lacks the political will and the professional know-how to provide a decent education for all, or even most, children in the city…""

the middle school was alright. some good teachers, decent curriculum. however, the school and entire building is filled with ghetto students, and contains gang members. 

not a very safe environment.

the school is all busy work. there is no engaging and thoughtful work. it is just assigned for the purpose of well... doing work.

last year, there was a stabbing in the building. the school never told parents or students that it had actually happened. in an email sent to parents, they used them term ""incident"". students only found out by asking guards who sad they were told not tell anyone. that alone is pretty disgusting.

i have heard that ""50%"" of the students that went to middle school stay for the high school. please, don't let this fool you. 99% of the students did not want to stay. that is a fact, and there is no way around that. the students who tried to go to better schools did, with a few getting into schools like Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and La Guardia. The ones who stayed did not have the grades to make it out. this is a fact. 

the students at the middle school are quirky. don't expect to be having too much fun outside of school. however, these are the students that made it out.

the high school is ghetto, and far worse than the middle school. bad teachers, crazy students, gangs, the works. and the staff doesn't do anything about it. they just push their false image of the school out to try and get more funding.

02M422,Maryk Mclan,manhattan,Middle,167,"I have not had the chance to look at this site for a long time. Most parents I know never, ever go to this site after they get their child into a middle or HS. in fact, when I have looked at comments for various schools, usually what I see for a lot of schools, only the negative feelings about a school. As I read the many comments here, I understand some of what is said but disagree with much. My child (has IEP) goes to Quest HS, he has been there since 6th grade. We truly loved the middle school, he thrived and finally learned to like math and science, which he was so turned off to in elementary school (he went to one of the most sought after schools). His 9th grade in HS was fine but the last 2 years have not been so great overall. We tried to get him into an alternative school last year but he has perfect attendance, all his credits, passed his regents and he is a good kid, (just not a great student) because of all his positive school results, he was not a candidate). 
I have to disagree with this parent on several facts. To say that the school is not safe is painting a false picture. My son has never had trouble and he is a shy kid, not tough at all. I am deeply offended when someone say's this is a ""ghetto"" school. Do you even know the kids that go to Quest? I am not even sure what you mean when  you say Ghetto, I can only imagine what you mean, and it doesn't strengthen your posting. 
What I don't like about the HS, it is concentrating on regents exams, everything has to be taught with this in mind. My kid stayed at Quest because most of the other schools all concentrated on this and he had hoped for something different at Quest HS. This is the one thing I truly wish and hope, that they change. If they can become more like Beacon and the other 26 schools that do not have to do regents, they can go back to their original idea of how this school was intended. It will not benefit my son but my hope is for the future kids looking for something different. 

Sure, there are some teachers that are not great but my son has had some wonderful teachers, this year, last year and the middle school teachers were mostly all fantastic. True that many left last year and it disturbed me that they did (however, some of these teachers, I was happy to see go) there still remains terrific teachers. They have  been extremely responsive to my emails, request for meetings and helping my child. 

To say that kids who stay at the school after middle school are the ones who don't get in anywhere else, that's just not true. My son and his friends, all decent, some straight A students, choose to stay at Quest, putting it down as their first choice. I would like to know where you get the 99% wanted to leave, as fact? Did you get those quotes from the DOE? I highly doubt it. So express your dissatisfaction with real arguments, not stating things as fact when you don't know. If you want to inform a parent, state the facts of ""your experience"", in detail. Not just general. these statements could be about any school and doesn't give a parent information that they can use. 

As for the comment about those responding  on this site as staff, I know some of the people who have responded here and they are definitely parents. 
I can understand your frustration,  the last 2 years were not as good as prior years for my kid but to state things in your comments as fact is just not fair. 
You are obviously angry and dissatisfied but I am not clear on why? It's too general. I do wish the best for your child and for you. it is not easy when school is so troublesome for a kid. In NYC, we are lucky to have a choice. Where I grew up, we went to the HS in our neighborhood, good teachers, bad teachers.....   I know you probably will not believe this but Quest had students returning from HS (they left after middle), one from Stuyvesant. Yes, Several of my son's classmates from Quest middle got into Stuyvesant.

As we move forward, The principal has been replaced and I can only hope that this gentleman will be more supportive of his teachers, open to parents, ready to make Quest the innovative and fantastic school that it set out to be. Let's hope because many NYC kids need an innovative and engaging school.

Finally, one of my best friends asked me last year about Quest, as 
their child is going into 6th grade. i was very truthful to them with my
 concerns but also with positive experience as a parent for 6 years at 
Quest. They have an amazing child, good grades and excellent student. 
They will become a new Quest Family and I am happy for them. My hope is that by the time their child gets to 8th grade, the HS will be much 
stronger and inline with their original idea. 

(Note: regarding the stabbing, a school security guard cannot disclose this information. A school also has legal obligations and can only say so much. Asking for a school or anyone at a school to give you more information than they are allowed legally is asking for lawsuits. If you want that to change, you have to go to your politicians to change laws. Don't get down on a school or their administration.

The teachers are caring and engaged, the sensible midwestern principal fosters a sense of compassion, intellectual curiosity and community, and the arts and science programs are excellent. All the teachers have been great, in fact.  An excellent Spanish teacher too and extremely caring advisors. The PTA is dedicated and kind. Each class has students of different abilities and the more advanced students help the others in a non competitive environment.  I leave happy and grateful every time I visit there and my child is so much more excited about middle school than elementary with a more developed confidence and sense of self.

The staff is very responsive to commubication, input and questions from parents and children, as is the principal who is VERY hands on and amazing w BOTH kids and adults.   All of the staff that I have dealt with is passionate about their jobs and their love of kids and education.   I can't envision a better place for any child/pre-teen in the city.

The best thing this school does, other than accept all levels of learners, is that they support each student for the individual they are, encouraging them to use their unique gifts to contribute. The effects on self esteem and confidence are measurable. The school manages to support both the higher and lower performing students. Many go on to specialized high schools. 

I would respectfully disagree with the 6th grade parent about the tiers they set below. LMC placed in the citywide math competition, not once but seve
ral times. 

I love how much we were invited into the school to observe the arts celebrations and academic projects. The arts curriculum is phenomenal.

Deciding what schools to put on the list is challenging, but it can be narrowed down.  A lot of it depends on what kind of grades your child has and how they did on the state tests. You want to apply to the schools that will more than likely take your child. If your child got two 2s on the state tests, you probably don't want to put Lab or Salk first on the list.  I don't know what kind of student you have but, if he is a stellar one then you might want to consider putting ESMS, Salk or Lab first.  Other schools that are well-regarded in the district, but maybe not quite as competitive would be 289, 276, Clinton, Baruch SP and Wagner SP. The next tier would be SOF and Quest then after that Lower Manhattan, Baruch and Wagner AP classes. Many would argue with what I am saying, because we all have different opinions. Each of these schools have smart, motivated kids. This is just my experience when we applied, touring schools, talking to other parents, talking to the guidance counselor and reading all of the stats including test scores, which I think is important. Some of these schools have great scores and others do not. Scores aren't everything, but they are something. I suggest looking at the Learning Environment Surveys under Statistics above.

02M896,Jette Johnson,manhattan,Middle,385,"I actually attended this school years ago. I am 23 so that makes it around 12 years ago, the school is probably completely different with times being different but I loved this school. The small population and the tight space we were in well before the move gave the students, at least for me a sense of community and family, the teachers cared about us and we cared about them. Graduation was devasting for me because i had to leave the place I called home, I met some great people. One thing I have realized now that I am older is that the ages 11-13 are the hardest population of kids to work with and that the people that go into this feild should be commended. The low test scores should not be whole heartedly considered because there are so many different factors that go in to them being as low as they are. Parents and home life are the number factor. Teachers are not superhuman. They do their job but parents need to do their job as well for true results and outcomes. 
Anyway, I went to The High School of Economics and Finance, graduated on time. Went to College and am pursing a BSW and will be applying for the MSW program in the spring. I turned out pretty well. If I had anything to do with it, I would send your son to this school! :-)

02M896,Anonymous,manhattan,Middle,385,"Interested in knowing what criteria is being used to comment negatively on the schools mentioned. If looking solely at school performance on these tests, one should really educate themselves on the history of standardized testing and which students tend to outperform others on these exams. One should also take the time to look at a school's demographic and test results. A ""top school"" with many students passing at Level 3 and 4, may also have an extremely low percentage of Special Needs students and a non-existent ELL population. Similarly, a school that doesn't have such high test scores may simply serve a higher percentage of Special Education/ELL students (factors that may contribute to test performance.) I mean, it's not Rocket Science (although perhaps it is for those who choose to post negative comments before doing a little research.) 
When it comes down to it, there are schools whose students do great on these exams, but it doesn't mean that these schools are without flaws.

Of course, there are several other factors that account for how a school performs on these exams.
 If someone defines educational success through such a narrow lens, then perhaps they may be happier if their child attends a school that favors homogenous grouping of students.

Since starting in 2014, they already have been in two different locations creating instability for their students and disruption for their families. Now they are forced to move again because the Catholic Church, which owns the building in which they are now located, has decided to cash out in the hot property market and kick out the City Knoll students.

Maybe the Church needs the cash to pay its legal bills for all the sexual abuse lawsuits. However, whoever was involved in establishing City Knoll school should be fired because a proper home was never established before it enrolled students. The school is now facing declining enrollment and the DOE now wants to move it again to co-locate it at PS 111, an improving elementary school that had just got rid of its middle school. The DOE also wants to jam the proposal through without a proper analysis of the educational impact to both City Knoll and PS 111.

When people ask why so many students in the NYC public school system perform so poorly on the State math and ELA tests, you can point to this real-life data point. Poor planning.

Second, I've seen the diversity statistics for the school before. There is NO WAY they could possibly reflect the make-up of the Anderson program (as implied by the parent comment). They might accurately reflect the make-up of the whole school. Though Anderson actively recruits and accepts a large proportion of minority students, the number of black and Hispanic students attending is very small. I believe there are 3 non-white, non-Asian kids in my daughter's grade (out of about 55)... There is not a strong sense of community among the three programs. At worst there is animosity between them--though there has recently been more acknowledgement of the issue and an attempt to develop an improved sense of community.

03M054,Current parent,manhattan,Middle,867,"Just wanted to offer more commentary that is recent. Our child is currently in 8th grade and the school has been very good so far. It's fairly traditional, yes. You're not going to find a ton of progressive learning activities or really out-of-the-box thinking in terms of curriculum and instruction, but that hasn't been a negative thing. There have been times that I've wished the teacher chose different books or a more contemporary way of looking at, and engaging in, an issue or topic, but it hasn't been harmful. Our child hasn't found the curriculum to be particularly challenging - certainly not to the level we had anticipated when we first heard about the school and worried if it would be too much. The math and science teachers have been exceptional and really engaged our child in a way we never imagined! But we've been less than impressed with humanities thus far, in fact, have been pretty disappointed. The process of teaching the kids to write a research paper was underwhelming and poorly managed, I don't think our child learned a thing and it was a missed opportunity that took up a lot of (wasted) time. On the flipside, the school does an excellent job of scaffolding learning and responsibility through the science project. In 6th grade, they were really guided along with a lot of hand holding and support. In 7th grade, it was less so, and I can imagine in 8th grade it will be a far more independent process. It has been really interesting to see that in action. I think the principal even talks about that explicitly during the open houses and first day of school. It was really helpful to our child. I think they do a good job of preparing the kids for high school. In terms of socialization and school culture, our child hasn't complained about bullying, cliques (although we see they exist, which is normal), or other social issues. (As a frame of reference, our child isn't part of a popular clique and tends to be more independent around socialization, so if you have a kid who's not with the ""in"" crowd, know that at least for us, it hasn't been an issue, although I'm sure many other families might say their kid experienced bullying.) That said, there is definitely a very popular clique at the school! But that's middle school everywhere, I imagine. Teachers have been responsive to any emails, for the most part, and the school does a good job of having meetings and info sessions for parents around key things like state testing, high school admissions, safety, etc. And the principal ALWAYS starts meetings on time, which we greatly appreciate. So overall, it's been a good experience. Great? Maybe not. But absolutely solid. I think our child feels really prepared and ready for high school.",1,0,0,2018-09-07T13:54:45,0.75,0.012,0.14300000000000002,0.039,0.23399999999999999,0.023,0.14400000000000002,0.11599999999999999,0.077,0.157,0.564,0.052000000000000005

03M054,HarlemGent,manhattan,Middle,867,"I am the parent of a current high school freshman who is an MS 54 graduate. I am also the parent of a current fifth grader, and because of that I have started researching middle school options again. With that perspective: my son had an outstanding experience at MS 54, and I find many of the comments below so utterly alien as to be bewildered by them. While my first-hand experiences as a parent haven't always agreed with Inside Schools' ""reviews"", I have always found the review's description of the school to at least be recognizable in broad terms. Not so for the ""comments"" here. If these comments are typical for what comments can tell you about a school, they seem worthless as a source of information, to the point where I honestly wonder whether people with no connection to the school could be making things up, whether just for kicks, or perhaps even to discourage  families from applying and thereby increase their own odds of admission. I know that seems like a bizarre thing to say, but that is the level of dissonance I experience when I try to reconcile some of these criticisms with my own experience.  In any event, I feel obliged to offer my own thoughts about MS 54. 

Most of my son's teachers at MS 54 seemed to be excellent. Their teaching elicited superior work from him; more so in the humanities than in science, although this also reflects his own interests. He is also both good at and excited by math, and found math teachers with a strong command of the subject (something that unfortunately cannot be taken for granted) who managed to keep him engaged and challenged. He is a self-described nerd, and I think at most middle schools he would have been picked on; at MS 54, his peers seemed to embrace his eccentricities and passions.  

MS 54 expects kids to work hard on their academics, and there is a good deal of homework. But I and other parents I know did not find the amount to be excessive, and certainly not so much as to interfere with students pursuing passions outside of school. The school also puts a lot of effort into helping students take responsibility for organizing and managing their time and workload, which was great, both in terms of helping them manage their current obligations, and in terms of preparing them for high school and beyond. Teachers are readily available before school to offer extra assistance, whether to students who are struggling, or to students who are just excited about a subject and want to dive in deeper. As for commenters who describe a super-competitive environment over grades, or one in which students are highly stressed over their test scores, that just wasn't our experience at all. 

This coming year, the school will be eliminating the distinction between ""honors"" and ""non-honors"" tracks. It was really an obsolete distinction at a competitive-admissions school where all students are admitted on the basis of the same rubric, and where 60-70% of students are scoring at the top level on state tests, even though the school places little emphasis on test preparation. 

MS 54 is a large school, which has pluses and minuses. One plus is that it is big enough to support a vibrant extracurricular ecosystem with activities tailored to a variety of interests. The musical theater program is superb, managing to both put on first rate shows (there were kids involved who have performed professionally), and to embrace and welcome students with no previous performing arts experience. The model UN program holds its own at high school conferences, which they participate in because there just aren't many middle schools that offer this activity. 

Regarding safety, there was an incident one time where a student brought a knife to school; this would be easy to do, as there are no metal detectors. But this was a freak anomaly at a very large school where safety was never otherwise an issue. The knife was not used, and the school promptly learned what had happened and disciplined the student. It is true that MS 54 is not in the very safest neighborhood in Manhattan, and there were periodic incident reports about cell phone thefts and other crimes committed in the vicinity. But most kids walk to and from school every day (either from their home, or from one of the nearby subway stations), and if anything the challenge is getting them to remember that they need to stay alert to their surroundings; it certainly doesn't feel like a scary area.  

Finally, MS 54 provides strong support to families with the NYC high school admissions process, and has a good track record of getting students into both specialized high schools and competitive-entry non-specialized high schools. The former is based just on a test (or an audition, for LaGuardia), but for the latter schools know that MS 54 graduates will be ready to hit the ground running.",0,0,0,2017-09-18T03:41:19,0.75,0.012,0.14300000000000002,0.039,0.23399999999999999,0.023,0.14400000000000002,0.11599999999999999,0.077,0.157,0.564,0.052000000000000005

The academics are wonderful-math and sciences classes are a grade above the student's current grade in terms of content, but teachers are very nice and help guide you whenever you need it. They try to make every lesson memorable and creative while still getting the content through to students efficiently. Early academy 4 mornings a week before school helps whenever you need personalized attention or just want to finish an assignment. What's nice about it is that even the smartest kids go-its not like you're considered dumb or even judged at all for going to early academy. Ms54 has a HUGE library, a computer lab full of macs, and a big turf field for recess and outdoor gym classes. The social environment at MS54 is good, Sure, its a middle school so you'll get judge occasionally and there's gossip, but the school is a very welcoming community. Discipline is taken very seriously, and the school is very peaceful and students follow the rules.  There are tons of programs at MS54 besides the three main topics-8 electives and 4 languages to choose from.

03M054,Parent,manhattan,Middle,867,"I stumbled across this comment when I was using this site for our HS ranking search, but feel compelled to respond to this post.  My son is a current 8th grade Honors student at this school. He read this post and does not believe a student really wrote it and I tend to agree.  This looks like a parent or teacher post. While there are limited choices in this district and he probably would have gone to this school even in hindsight, there are some things I think those in 5th grade (and parents) should know:

1) Most of the teachers are very inspiring teachers at this school, but also some duds in the mix, especially in the math department.  Humanities has proven to be much stronger. Probably not too different from other MS. The teachers are accessible via email and are fairly responsive which is nice.
2) Contrary to what this post says, there is in fact alot of homework, and even the most diligent kids we know who are not on their phones all the time will be up late (after 11pm) either studying, doing the homework or finishing longer term projects. There are very few kids I know who will say there is not a heavy workload or who didn't get frustrated. If your child has a sport or activity afterschool that they do consistently that gets them home later than 4pm, get ready for a cranky sleep-deprived kid as they try to finish up their schoolwork.
3) My son has had very little minority representation in terms of African Americans in his class (maybe other minorities, but very, very few blacks).  He thinks maybe one or two a year in classes as big as 34.  He said the academic classes are much more diverse. 
4) My son says that the Honors kids do think the academic kids are not smart and they are generally viewed as the classes that are not high achievers and won't take regents like the rest of the school. I don't think you know whether your child is placed in honors or academic before the choice application is due though.  But be aware that the kids do label each other as ""academic"" or ""honors"" 
5) The kids are very focused on grades and who makes high honor role.  There is alot of pressure from the very first marking period. The school does not help matters by publicly posted the list of kids making high honor roll, and also has a ceremony at the end of every school for only those on high honor roll. (My son did make HH each term and  I don't ascribe to ""every kid should get a trophy""  However, I do think that the emphasis on grades in middle school is a little extreme - it's stressful for these kids who already have enough stress living in NYC and having to apply out to high school - so you need to know if your kid can handle this).
6) Location is not ideal. Anything west of the school is ok, but never have your kid walk east which isn't a great block. School area is relatively safe right when it lets out, but most of us do not allow our kids to hang out up there after school. Also they have recently hired safety patrol parents who monitor the area as a result of some not so great scenarios and threats, but I don't have all the facts.
7) At the end of the day - yes, this school probably prepared my son for the work load at a specialized high school but you really need to think about whether this is what you want for your child between the ages of 11-13 and whether they'd be prepared for HS even if they didn't go here. The problem is there just aren't alot of choices in district 3 so there's not much between the grind of this school and the only other 2 major schools in this district.

03M054,Student,manhattan,Middle,867,"I'm sorry, but THIS comment is fake. I may be wrong but in this note you write similarly to the first note. You use the same expression, ""let me tell you."" Again, I might be wrong; there is always a possibility that two different people wrote in the same comment chain with the same opinion and using the same expression. Just saying.

However, the first comment is most definitely not written by a student. No student would write, ""Ask yourself and your child this: Is he/she willing to make the effort? In a nutshell, any student would love this school, and you just need to stay happy and work hard!!"" or start bragging about the school by saying ""The students here will surprise you with their raw intelligence and pure talent. As a parent, you might have the notion that Middle schoolers are not capable of doing the things that is usually expected of high schoolers. Our chorus, strings, and jazz band is amazing, and the activities we do, such as a mock election for class president this year was astounding. The things Booker T. students are capable of doing is nothing less then astonishing."" or even say ""The homework at this school is in no way unbearable as many parents will have you think, it is simply what your child does with his/her time. These three years are not testing your ability to do a lot of homework, it is helping you improve your time management skills, which will be much needed for high school.""

Anyway, I would simply like to express my opinion that the first note is DEFINITELY a fake. No student in the 8th grade would write in such an eloquent way. Of all people, I should understand, as I am an 8th grade honors student with a 98 and 99 average. However, I'm ACTUALLY in 8th grade. I assume that a teacher wrote this or at least a parent did. 

There are many false allegations in the original comment that I certainly disagree with. First of all, most teachers, especially in 8th grade, seem to want to get the job done instead of teaching and inspiring us. There are a few bright spots throughout the day, but I still dread waking up in the morning to go to school because I know I have to face my mediocre, least favorite teachers everyday.

Half of my class doesn't even care anymore, even in the honors program. They basically sleep through class, and don't care for what the teacher is taking about. However, the school puts SOOO much pressure on us to get high honor roll. Everyone knows who's in honors and who's in academic, because there is still so much pressure put on to us by the school that basically causes a social class divide, even though many of the students in academic should be in honors and vice versa. Only a month ago, two kids in an HONORS class came into school smelling like weed because they had done drugs the previous night at another kids party - a kid from Booker T.

At the high honor role ceremony at the end of the year last year, there was one person - ONE PERSON - from a certain academic class who made it on to high honor role all four marking periods. It was a pitiful sight that I can still picture. In many of the academic classes, no one makes it to the high honor role ceremony at all.

The first comment says,  ""Model UN delegates, like me, write essays every night about topics we choose and find interesting. (Only if they want to, that is.)"" It fails to note that while our Model UN is very accomplished and smart, the people chosen are completely random. Kids who goof off in class and ""forget"" to do their homework are chosen over incredibly smart kids, and academic kids rarely get chosen.

There is a severe difference between academic and honors. You will not find out which program you are in until 3 DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. The lying principal will have you believe that this is because there isn't a difference, but it's really because if you knew beforehand that you were in academic and what goes on in the separate classes, you would definitely choose a different school. I know a numerous amount of people who transferred out of academic into private school because the students and teachers were not focused on teaching or learning anything similar to the honors classes. I have personal experiences with this because my close friends have been in academic and hated it so much they decided to leave. The school wants you to believe that there HAS to be two programs for additional funding reasons, but when you go to the DOE website there is no such requirement. These decisions are entirely made by the school. Additionally, even if you are a student who received top scores at your elementary school, if you didn't do well on your state exams YOU WILL NOT BE IN HONORS.

Whatever teacher or parent wrote the  first comment is flat out lying about the race issues at the school. They wrote, ""I am a 13 year old black boy, and I am one of the many minority children in the Honors division. This school does not care about ethnicity or social status, the only thing that matters is your will to learn and be focused."" This quote states the truth in one place: when it says that there are very few minority children in the honors program. The school has had many problems in the past concerning race, and these problems persist years later. There are legit 3 African American students in my class of around 31, and a few other minority students. Honors is primarily white students, while academic is much more diverse, as mentioned in the first reply to the top comment.

Race issues don't only appear in honors and academic. The dean is a bully to all, but is especially mean to minority students (i.e. stopping them instead of a white kid for running.) He screams at most people in general and will literally push people into line when we line up to get into school in the morning.

As a student who has an after school activity every day after school, I would like to address another claim in the first comment that homework is easy if you don't procrastinate. THIS IS A BIG, FAT, GLORIOUS LIE. I am an extremely hard-working student. I start my homework right when I get home and usually don't get distracted and still end up finishing up at 12 or 1 in the morning. So, I have to ask the writer of the comment: Are you a robot human or just have superpowers? Because I don't know a single person who is so perfect they can say, with confidence, ""The homework content and the amount of it are both doable, and the cause for the stress of homework and not being able to finish it is solely the cause of not being focused and getting off task."" LIES.

03M054,Truffledor,manhattan,Middle,867,"In a way, I understand what you mean. This is my last year at this school and I'm doing the 5th grade tours tomorrow. The first year was horrible for me. Not because of the school, but because of me. Indeed, stress was happening for me cause I was not at all used to this new way of life. There was stress, crying, sleepless nights and so on. So instead of focusing, I was too wrapped up in games because it made me happy. Perfect. Would stay beyond 3 AM at times. 7th grade, determined to do it differently and didn't play the games. Went so much better.

My point is, the sudden change is going to discourage the student if they aren't ready. It's so much better to talk to the teacher and explain how you feel, instead of yell at them. They are human, they understand your feelings and frustration. 6th grade, it's my math teacher's first year and and my poor mom is class parent. Why is that a bad thing at the beginning of the year? All the parents were yelling at both of them and telling the teacher they need to slow done in lessons. Doesn't help to yell and does tire them. For competition... perhaps. We don't make a big deal out of other test scores, but when someone does well, we cheer them on. Homework is meh if you know how to manage your time and actually do it. Basically all the teachers offer help because they truly want their students to do well. Harsh grading system... depends. You get a rubric/are told what to do unless your teacher wants you to decide. Participation, Test, Classwork, Homework and Behavior are important for the grade.

I would have to disagree with the no interaction part, no offense. You can email teachers and staff in general in case of problems or questions. There are also a whole load of activities students can do after school as well. For example, I've been participating in the school play for the last two years and just auditioned for this years play yesterday.

A good example of stress is the SHSAT, State Test, and Regions. Teachers are nice enough to go through ELA and Math preparation for the State Test, even if they hate it. My Humanities teacher last year hated teaching it yet went through the trouble for us.  

Now, 8th grade is absolutely amazing and I love it to death. Sure, work work work, but it's much better to look on the positive side. 

I hope you and your child is happy where they are.

The rumors about intense homework were not totally true. You can slip under the radar and do the minimum amount (one hour/day) without too many repercussions. Classes, particularly 8th grade math, are in fact very rushed. The teachers give many make-up options however so that grades overall tend to remain above 90. And there are ""early academies"" where kids can attempt to catch a teacher's more individualized attention. Some Pros: 1. Passionate instructors with very few bad apples thrown in (though there was at least one disastrous retirement ready teacher every year) 2. A very thorough high school counselor. 3. Enough electives to keep things interesting. 4. Friendly bright kids for the most part.  5. Good organization considering there are so many students. Some cons: 1. Reading and grammar are kept at a bare minimum. Kids are allowed to claim they read 40 books a term, whether they do or not  2.There are still ""academic"" classes that tend to group minorities together (though I hear this is changing). 3.Phys Ed is a bit of a bust, a lot of sitting around if you choose. 4.The supervisor, or ""dean"" in charge of conduct is a bully and does very little to hear students out when an issue occurs.

Teachers have changed multiple times, so I am unsure whether I am speaking of the same teachers this person was speaking of, but I want to make it clear that while there are some teachers who have clear favorites and treat some with a smile and others with a frown, not all teachers are like this and there are many, such as my Humanities teacher, who keep completely neutral and try their best to help all the students in any way they can. This, in fact, has been my experience at Booker T. with all my teachers: they want you to succeed, not to fail, and what I have found is that it is better to ask questions if you don't understand a concept then to go home and not do the work because you ""didn't get it"". And yes, concepts can be confusing or frustrating sometimes but you work through it and most teachers are more than willing to help you out.

03M054,Student,manhattan,Middle,867,"I am a current 8th grader in the ""honors"" program, and I'd just like to write about my experience here. I'm attending LaGuardia in the fall, and I literally can not wait to leave Booker T. I'd like you guys to see the school from a student's perspective- not a parent's, who only sees the grades and the front the school puts on during parent teacher conferences. 
     All in all, my experience in this school wasn't exactly the best. There are only a  few amazing teachers in this school, who really are great people. The funny thing is these teachers don't teach science or math, they teach art and music- that means I'm stuck with the undesirable  teachers everyday. These good teachers make me want to explore the world. They make me curious, and they make me laugh and just writing this makes me emotional because I'm a very emotional person and I know I'm gonna miss them a lot when I leave. 
     There is A LOT of favoritism in this school and it's very upsetting. Don't think I'm saying this because I feel ""jealous"" and whatnot because I don't. I don't wake up everyday at the crack of dawn to be a teacher's pet. It's just that these teachers waste so much class time goofing off with their favorites and it really is annoying. Like come on man, shut up and teach us this so we can hopefully never see you again. That sounds harsh, I know, but I've had a some bad experiences with injustice in this school. I'm afraid to even ask questions in my math class, because I know that I will be yelled at and I'm gonna feel like I'm stupid. That's why I learn from the internet. :) But you see, that doesn't happen when the favorites ask questions. I could rant about all my individual experiences I've had with injustice in this school, but it would bore you.
     Really the only reason this bothers me so much is because the favorites are the same kids who smoke weed and hook up and bully others. Just a reminder, we are talking about 13-14 year old EIGHTH graders. These kids are the boys who once threw hurtful homophobic slurs at my friend, alongside the ""popular"" girls who wear pushup bras and crop tops with LEGGINGS and are never told anything about it, and gossip about everyone. My non-white friend once wore a sleeveless shirt and boy did she get told off by a teacher. They're ""popular"" for the wrong reasons, because sure as hell it's not for their fake personality. I've seen a lot of nice people do bad things and change for the worst. I'm just done with all these fake people and I can't wait for high school. Hopefully I won't need to see any of these kids again. If you read this entire thing, thank you. I could go on, but I'd rather not.
If you're attending this school, I wish you the best.",4,0,0,2014-05-18T01:30:55,0.75,0.012,0.14300000000000002,0.039,0.23399999999999999,0.023,0.14400000000000002,0.11599999999999999,0.077,0.157,0.564,0.052000000000000005

This sentiment still holds true and I encourage parents to visit --and not just on a school tour but come during our many family and community events like our Chess Nights,  movie nights - in both Spanish and English, our upcoming Black History celebration, and our amazing school auction which my husband calls ""the parent's prom"" in May.

- Balance of mandated school work (e.g. math, science, language arts) and programming in the arts, music and other areas

The principal of 20 years, Bob O'Brien, is smart, engaged, and hard-working.  He hires good teachers and the teachers stick around even if they move away and have to commute.  The parent community is strong and active and fun.  There are a lot of segregated schools in New York - this isn't one of them.  The after school program is the best I saw in touring a number of schools.  There are multiple good options for each day of the week, they are reasonably priced, and your child can learn to swim, play soccer, tennis, dance, ceramics, cooking, capoeira, magic, chess, etc. - without you having to get them from the school to some offsite location.  In case you're into numbers: there are 2 dual language classes per grade, with 25 students each, one teacher and an aide for half the day.  There are 3 integrated co-teaching (ICT) classes per grade, mixing roughly 1/3 special needs (IEP) or high functioning autistic kids, and 2/3 general education kids.  Some of the ICT classes have only 10-15 students and 2 teachers per class, plus teacher's aide(s), so great student to teacher ratios, and 40 kids or so total.

03M075,PS75 Parent,manhattan,Elementary,548,"Hi ANPC -- 

Breakfast in the Classroom Program (BIC) provides in-classroom
breakfast to children at the start of the school day in New York City public
schools. Children can take or leave the breakfast that is offered which can consist of 100% juice products, milk, cheese sticks, granola bars, yogurt, mini bagels with cream cheese – just to name a few of the whole grain and locally sourced foods. The BIC program among all NYC schools is the same and the breakfast menu for the month is available on line. My 1st grade daughter eats breakfast at home every morning, but occasionally will take the breakfast. It’s completely voluntary. At PS75 breakfast is offered after morning attendance for 10 minutes at which time students are invited to partake. 


New York City offers free breakfasts to all public school children,
and almost 75% of public school children are eligible for free or reduced price lunch due to household income. Studies show that children who eat a healthy breakfast pay more attention in class and have lower rates of tardiness and absenteeism.

I would be happy to talk to you about the many wonderful science,
art and enrichment programs offered for every single student at PS75. Please feel free to reach out here for further queries.

We have been at the school for 5 years, and we felt like once we got in the grove the community was there to participate in as a family. Education is highly important in the sense that we are concerned with the culture of the life of the school. We have found that all kinds of families are embraced, and it is not perfect but no school is ever. Many there are concerned less with prepping for the testing and accountability measures and more with intelligent social action in community. However, more than adequate time is spend to familiarize children with those assessments. 
There is not one type of family, and, like New York City and when one looks round at the world, there are many languages and cultures represented, often within any given family. At its best, the school looks to harness those resources and talents that come from the community, including those of its staff. I have worked for several years in collaboration with the staff members, families from the PTA (everyone is considered a member), the JCC and New York Cares, and I know that such community collaboration requires people who have this stance. We luckily have had an early bird reading program for 25 years because of this culture of collaboration. It is always a work-in-progress.

Believe me I have no axe to grind or desire to distort answers.  I would much rather have a good zoned public school option than face moving districts or private school tuition.

P.S. 84 is a participant in the Wellness in the Schools Cook for
Kids program, which replaces the traditional cafeteria menu with a healthy
menu based on scratch cooking and fresh ingredients. WITS places a
trained culinary profession in the school cafeteria to prepare fresh meals from
scratch, engage students, and educate families about the importance of eating
whole, unprocessed foods through interactive cooking demonstrations called WITS
Labs. You can find out more about programming from Wellness in the Schools and

03M084,Mlanp,manhattan,Elementary,566,"PS 84 is an extraordinary school in which children are learning and thriving. PS 84’s current “progress report” grade assignment by DOE is
a reflection of the DOE’s failure to use appropriate statistical tools to
measure a school’s success and is also a testament to how racially loaded the
current scoring  system is.   Mayor Bloomberg himself lauded the academic
success of the children of PS 84 in front of the French President Sarkozy just
two days prior to release of the grade: “The fantastic kids of PS 84…. They
already speak French better than I speak English!” Watch at http://www.frenchculture.org/spip.php?article4618
.
  


PS 84 has been so remarkably successful in attracting
neighborhood families over the past 3-4 years, that the demographics of the school
have changed rapidly.  The demographic changes
have not yet hit the grades being tested. 
Nonetheless, the DOE has chosen to compare PS 84’s scores based on the
whole school’s demographics, rather than the demographics of the students in
the grades being tested.  In fact, PS 84
has seen significant gains in its test scores; if PS 84’s tested classes,
comprised of 90% minorities, had been compared to similar schools, such as PS
165, PS 84 would have received an “A” grade. 
Most of PS 84’s scores are in fact higher than those of PS 165’s “A”
grade. 



As an active parent at PS 84 over the past 3 years, I have witnessed
how the school’s positive changes in learning environment have led ironically to
lower “progress report” grades… all for reasons apart from the children, the
faculty and staff and the learning that is taking place.    A
more accurate tool for reflecting the situation in a school that is succeeding
is clearly needed! ",0,0,0,2011-10-12T04:02:15,0.75,0.081,0.191,0.064,0.40299999999999997,0.08,0.302,0.032,0.076,0.34299999999999997,0.502,0.166
03M084,Eliz,manhattan,Elementary,566,"We have a forward-looking, experienced principal, smart teachers, engaged children, involved parents & great enrichment & after school activities (La Casa), despite the bare bones budgets all schools are compensating for. The dual language programs attract what becomes a diverse cohort from all over the city, while Ms. Sundick has also succeeded in turning PS 84 back into a ""neighborhood school"". 
NB: PS 84's recent progress report grade felt arbitrary & inaccurate to those of us involved in the school. (We received an A two years ago with the same principal). The way these scores are calculated can be very confusing, but there is a very heavy weight (75%) placed on the school's performance versus our ""peer group"". So the city does a calculation that takes into account the number of kids who receive free lunch, the number of minorities, the number of English Language Learners and sticks us in a group. Our school is not static and the demographic has changed. What is up for discussion (among many things) is whether the formula used is appropriate, and whether we are being compared to the correct peer group. Our score would be quite a bit better if it were purely a citywide comparison.  Starting 5 years ago, PS84's score has been C,B,A,C,F---with most being the same, the same zone boundaries, etc---but the score swings a lot. Also, Bloomberg's administration admitted last year to padding scores to make themselves look better (after which they re-scored all the student exams), so my confidence in these things is pretty shot.",0,0,0,2011-09-29T21:19:42,0.75,0.081,0.191,0.064,0.40299999999999997,0.08,0.302,0.032,0.076,0.34299999999999997,0.502,0.166

Another, is that I wish they had a dedicated gym class. Another casualty of limited space, time and budget. However the ICT class deals with this by having dance class twice a week. They are also allowed multiple movement breaks throughout the day, both scheduled and as needed. Something that I am sure all children, ICT or not, benefit from.

03M087,Guest,manhattan,Elementary,880,"*Attention Special Needs*
I just toured this school. As the parent of a child with special needs, I was *extremely* disappointed, especially given the hype about PS87.
Let me start with the cafeteria which, during lunch, is host to (brace yourself) 150 kindergarteners. Would your child have a hard time with all that stimuli? No problem! According to a teacher in the ICT class, PS87 will give your child noise-cancelling headphones. That way they won't be bothered by the excess noise. Nor can they actually interact with any of their peers. Wonderful.

Then let me mention the giant bucket of scissors I noticed on a bottom shelf of a kindergarten class. I think they were safety scissors...but then there was the one pair of adult scissors which was left on a low table. These kids are still young and, special needs or no, I think supervision with scissors is still a good idea.

The school literature (which was handed out at the tour) even goes so far as to say about the ICT classes (which are 60% gen ed, 40% special ed) ""Children on the general education side are 'model' students–they must model excellent behavioral and learning habits."" Seriously? Do these gen ed children really get *nothing* else out of the experience of being with differently-abled peers other than just being models?? How about tolerance? Or empathy? Or maybe, just maybe, those special needs kids have *something* to offer.

She has the best Security Guards.and staff.  She has implemented the safety panic bars which is a wonderful ideal.   I'm very pleased at how my baby does  her homework by herself, her writing has improved alot, she loves to read even more which  is terrific!  I love her teacher; she keeps me informed about how her progress is doing.  I like that, all teachers need to do that.  Having a dance studio, Art studio,  Music room, Dual Lanuage and not to mention a great after school program in the school was an excellent idea.  It helps my child  to stay  busy.  These are positive and educational programs that are benefiting her in so many ways.  What I really like about Dr. Garcia is her attitude;  how she loves the children and how she respects each and everyone of us. Thank you Dr. Garcia for making it easier for my wanting my child to be apart of this school.  Also, thank  you for bringing discipline, structure and order back into P.S. 145.!!

Soy Shirley
Tengo a mi hija desde 1er grado y es el 1er año en que he podido ver un verdadero desarrollo en todas las areas...
Las conferencias tienen actualmente un realse de seguridad y confianza en que nuestras preocupaciones van a ser escuchadas y nuestras dudas contestadas.
Es el 1er año en el que podemos ver cambios completamente favorables para todos los alumnos empezando por la seguridad. Desde el año pasado cambio el sistema de entrada y salida de los alumnos algo que antes era un verdadero caos y nadie había prestado atención hoy en día no sólo hay orden sino seguridad de que nuestros hijos están dentro de la escuela seguros 
Es la 1ra vez que tenemos una noche de espectáculo donde nuestros hijos son las estrellas..verlos con sus trajes de gala y saber que todo fue trabajadp en equipo es una satifaccion doble
 verlos actuar bailar y cantar a todos nos lleno de felicidad y de deseos devolverlos a ver.
 todo estuvo muy bien organizado y excelente
Gracias Dr.Garcia por su excelente desempeño
por su entrega y amor al progreso de nuestros hijos 
Siga hacia delante

""Every class we visited, whether general ed or G&amp;T, seemed focused and intent. An average lower-grade class size of only 18 (23 for upper grades) helps. The G&amp;T kindergarten, divided into two classes, was amazing. One had only ten children (the school wants to attract more G&amp;T applicants), so there was lots of individual attention. The other, slightly larger, was enthusiastically singing a complex song when we entered. That song spoke volumes--not only spirited, but the most advanced performance by 5-year-olds I have ever heard; no one missed a note or a beat, or wavered from pitch, like normal 5-year-olds do....The amiable new principal, Ivelisse Alvarez (previously at PS 114 in the Bronx) is definitely in charge. 'Good morning, Mrs. Alvarez!' the kids greeted her in unison in every room,"" this parent wrote.</P>

The library is cluttered and untended--not surprising, since there is no librarian.

(The school safety officer said the parents are more trouble than the kids are; some don't want to show ID when they come in the door.)"" There are many new immigrants from Mexico, Ecuador and Central America, and most of the students are Spanish-speaking.

It is also the only school in the district and perhaps the borough with long-standing and successful tracks in both dual language and g&t.  The Dual Language Spanish program has long been among the strongest in the borough, and is now effectively aligning to the Common Core, with Principal Lopez rising swiftly to the challenge.  It will return to two classes per grade and welcome students from outside the zone, starting with the incoming kindergarten class in 2015/16.

03M163,Boyraising,manhattan,Elementary,520,"At PS 163 your experience will depend on which teachers your
child gets although even the SUPERSTARS (Engler, Flores, Martinez, Castro,
Doughty, as well as many more outstanding instructors) are FORCED to teach a punishing curriculum (this is a school with a new FIRSTTIME principal who is firmly committed to toeing the Common Core line). ALL teachers are required to assign an excessive amount of homework even to lower grades (which is not mandated by the DOE rather it is a school policy) even though it is developmentally INappropriate (up to an hour a night for a 6 year old - come on). I have been told that (G&T PARENTS especially) often push for more homework (over-achieving Manhattan parents!) Class size is also troubling (23 in K, 24 in 1st, 26 in 2nd, 29(!) in 3rd) with ONE teacher although I get the impression this is a citywide problem (perhaps if the DOE did not spend so much money w/Pearson on shoddy standardized tests they could hire more teachers to help ease class size pressure or at least provide fulltime teachers aides).

It’s important to know that Dr. Pepe retired at the end of 2012 school year and
Mr. Lopez was brought in as Principal. This is his first job in a Principal
position and while he comes across as charming & interested, as far as I
have seen and heard from several other parents, he is in fact untruthful and
not terribly effective in terms of leading/inspiring the teachers, listening to
the parents or (god forbid) the children. Some teachers and families have left
the school as a result of this. In addition there is at least one AWFUL teacher, which I imagine is true in most places. Also our beloved & effectual Parent Coordinator (Andi V) left in 2013 but has been replaced w/a nice woman whose children recently graduated from PS 163.
Approx 630 kids attend this school so obviously there will
be those who disagree w/me but I know I would appreciate having this
information if I was looking at schools. I encourage prospective families
to ask pointed questions and hold the administration accountable for their
answers. In addition, incoming families should have an understanding about what
the Common Core actually demands and how it’s “rollout” means for their
children (again not necessarily only a PS163 specific problem).

Things I love (in addition to things mentioned above):
Diversity of students & parents and the ease with which everyone connects (I have not encountered any snobby or disinterested parents).
I am continuously impressed by the intelligence &commitment of the parents towards resolving every PS 163 issue/need.
Lots of teachers who love the kids and make heroic efforts to teach them.
Dance enrichment for 3rd grade is great.
Guidance counselor Ms. Jennifer(Smullian), music teacher Spallina, gym teacher Vega, both science teachers are all wonderful.

Things I do not love:
Large class size (I believe this is a Citywide problem).
Disingenuous, inexperienced Principal who has decided to demonstrate his
ability in defining the schools standards by readily conforming to the current
CommonCore/Standardized Testing push as well as initiating a new grading rubric
that is so troublesome the teachers are filing a formal complaint with the
union.",0,0,0,2014-09-08T14:59:21,0.75,0.057999999999999996,0.196,0.008,0.503,0.11199999999999999,0.396,0.063,0.192,0.406,0.281,0.22699999999999998

Among those who admitted this pretty undeniable fact, many took the position that it was unfortunate but basically harmless and out of our hands, since the school has no role in G&T admissions.

In 2014, the school community began to have more honest and productive conversations about the downsides of having multiple educational tracks in the same school and to acknowledge that the makeup of G&T is not representative of the community. The school's Comprehensive Educational Plan now includes two goals aimed at addressing some of these problems by creating more frequent and meaningful opportunities for children in different educational tracks to learn and play together and by working to diversify and increase parent involvement.

03M163,SA,manhattan,Elementary,520,"I have just visited this school last week and I was impressed by the way classrooms are managed by their respective teachers. I was really thrown off and had lost interest in the school by the principal by the name of Virginia.  I had more questions to ask by the end of my tour and she replied with ""Oh you still have more questions?"" and as I was writing down answers to the questions I had asked her she asked sarcastically with a big fake smile on her face ""What..are you writing notes down? Is this some sort of research group or a specific department you work for?"" (She had asked me this because she noticed how the other 3 parents and I [In which I asked more questions than anyone else] had more questions to ask than any other parent in the tour) I simply replied with ""Um no I just want what's best for my daughter. Now my next question is.."" I proceeded with my questions as I had felt as if I was obligated to state why was I asking so many questions.  I don't think it's wrong to ask ""What's the lowest temperature you would take the kids out to play?"" because some kids may get pneumonia or bronchitis in which it would be terrible if they take out the kids knowing some may be sick. THEY STILL TAKE THEM OUT under 32 degree weather, whether there's snow outside or not. Now there were exceptions for those who are sick in which they get to stay in while the others play (Didn't like this idea but whatever, wasn't interested in the school after her attitude). My other question was why were the computers old? I have been to others schools in which they are using up to date Mac computers. Supposedly in the upcoming fall they will change to newer, updated computers. My next question was why was the art room in such a clutter? There were hardly any access to the windows and all the clutter occupied half of the room in which kids can't even see if there were windows in the room.  She said it is an ""Art Room"" so a cluttered would be expected. Umm I don't think so.  I remember in all the art rooms I have attended as a student myself and other school tours, the room is neat with many drawings posted to inspire students to have more creativity/motivation for their own artwork. My other ""hard"" question for her was ""I noticed in the G&T classrooms, they consist of Caucasian teachers whereas in bilingual and general education classes, there are more Hispanic and African American teachers. Would you say this school is diverse?"" After the confusion of her assuming I was talking about the students (in which I agree-relating to students-it is diverse) she proceeded explaining and recall her responding with ""I will have to admit yes there are more Caucasian teachers in this school than anything else but it all comes down to your preferences"" So basically telling me it's up to me if I want to put my child in a school like that. I finally ended it with that and she gave me her fake smile and handshake (in which I had to put out for her because she was ready to turn around to the next person without saying goodbye). If I ever considered placing my daughter into this school, I would have to have a one to one talk with this principal..",1,0,0,2012-01-30T07:16:00,0.75,0.057999999999999996,0.196,0.008,0.503,0.11199999999999999,0.396,0.063,0.192,0.406,0.281,0.22699999999999998

 I'm
 a parent of a gifted and non-gifted child who both attend P.S. 163.  My family is also African American.  I have never experienced any racism or had a negative encounter with anyone at the school.  The school is made up of parents of many backgrounds (Black, White, Asian and Spanish).  The staff there is extremely helpful.  The Parent Coordinator is a gem.  When I was unhappy with my oldest child's school she guided me through the process to get my oldest into P.S. 163.  The Co-President of the PTA took a call from me at 9pm when I was unhappy about some school photographs that came out bad.  I was able to have my child re-take the shots with no extra cost to me.  I could go on about the staff but I won't.  The school is very welcoming.My 2nd grader is in 
the gifted program.  My 2nd grader scored high enough on the gifted 
tests that she could have gotten into any school that she wanted.  I 
picked P.S. 163 because I liked the atmosphere.  I especially liked the 
fact that there is not attitude of ""we are better then you"" among the 
students who are in gifted class against the ones who are in general 
education classes.  I also liked that while there is a strong academic 
program, the children are allowed to actually have fun and be children. 
 I have also never had a problem speaking to Dr. Pepe or the Assistant Principal Ms. Spence (who by the way happens to be African American).  I find that the school goes out of their way to help all parents.  All school notices are printed in English and Spanish.  The school has a great afterschool program run by LEAP which is from 3-6pm.  I'm not someone who is easily impressed but I can honestly say that this school is a wonderful place for parents and children. No school is perfect and you have some parents who are not always pleasant.  For whatever reason maybe the school was not the right fit for you and your child.

The administration is available and is a constant presence in the school. The teachers are dedicated, hard working and have always been willing to give extra time to help support our child s education and development. I especially like the trailers for the kindergarten classrooms. I had neutral feelings about them going into the school year but they turned out to be ideal. The kids have their own bathroom, drop off & pick up are at the classroom door and there is a nice play yard just for the kindergartners. The school does not raise as much money as some of the other D3 schools but I feel the school and PTA have done a great job in choosing the right places to spend the money.

Unlike many schools, ps165 does a good job of effectively integrating the dual language and g&t programs with the rest of the school (the g&t class is also notably more diverse than others I toured). My child's participation in Urban Arts and a school-wide recycling program (where she is a class rep) have helped her made good friends from outside the small g&t community, and both that experience and the arts activities have really added a lot to her year at PS165. At UA, the K/1 students participate in dance, chorus, visual arts, and drama. Older children also do drumming and other activities. The UA program is free (yay!), but does not fully meet demand so we were very lucky to be in the program this year. The PTA is active, hosting and organizing math, literacy and movie afternoons/evenings. If you are looking at g&t the classes are smaller here than the other D3 schools which means there is a lot of individualized attention. Other pluses: guitar taught in music, a kiln in the art studio means your child is exposed to something you can't really do at home, weekly optional chess afterschool, lots of positive reinforcement from many teachers throughout the school, large classrooms with big windows, an indoor gym that the school makes the most of.

PS 165 is a pioneer in the DL Spanish program. We are not a spanish-speaking family and to have the chance for our child to learn a new language at a young age in a public school just a few blocks away, is truly priceless.  

In addition to its strong curriculum, (it is also a showcase school for math) every child has guitar lessons weekly, creates amazing ceramics in Art (I have been the delighted recipient of a coffee cup, and two vases!)    The school also partners with the NY Philharmonic (grades 3-5) and New Victory Theater.    Thanks to previous PTA Boards we have two ‘E3’ (Educate, Exercise, Evolve) sports coaches at recess  http://e3sports.com/school-programs/recess/  who in conjunction with the Special Aides, work to create and oversee structured play and games that are age specific and safe.    (There are no movies/cartoons for our students when it rains!!)

As working parents, the school’s relationship with the A.C.T after school program (at St. John the Divine) has been enormously beneficial to my husband and I.  ACT Counselors will collect the students every day at dismissal and walk them to the Cathedral.  Pick-up in the evening can be as late as 6:15pm.  Which is ideal when you are traveling from downtown.  The in-house after school clubs (YMCA and Urban Arts ) also offer a fantastic set of activities (finishing at 5/5:30pm )  such as Photography, Chorus, Drumming, Theater, Dance.  There is also an after-school chess club on tuesdays.

03M165,X,manhattan,Elementary,395,"While the dual language teachers are excellent (because they themselves excellent), PS165 is NOT a pioneer in the DL Spanish program. Far from it, in fact. There are many schools in the area who have longer running, more robust, and sought after DL Spanish programs. PS165’s program may, however, benefit from the larger than average number of native Spanish speakers attending the school. 

Moreover, this school is in NO WAY a “showcase school for math”. Unless you interpret that to mean showcasing how to do basic mathematics incorrectly.

I have witnessed their disastrous mathematics instruction firsthand. Their math test scores are below average (and median) and are otherwise disappointing. There’s a reason why. Hint: it is not the curriculum, which is literally scripted. 

Please do not let this wave of glowing reviews fool you. PS165 was revisited by Insideschools early in 2019 (a visit that was an extreme priority and focus of “effort” for the school considering their previous subpar review) and it is no coincidence this flood of overly positive reviews began around that time. 

Lastly, consider the composition of G&T classrooms. If there are 10 children in each of these classes, wouldn’t it follow logically they would have a more successful learning experience and environment than the remainder of classes with nearly 30 children each?

He is now in the G&T Kindergarten class, and still has opportunities for shared times with the kids in the dual language and general ed classes which I am pleased with.

My son is in Mrs. Sanches' Pre-K class (but both class teachers are terrific), and the individual attention each child receives is truly commendable. She often takes the time to talk about any issues and really work with the parents so that we can help at home. My son has matured and learned so much- both academically, and socially. I've also taken an active role at the PTA meetings, and have befriended many other parents who have kids in both the dual language programs, and gifted and talent programs. I've only heard wonderful things about both programs, especially dual language. They've just started offering an after-school program, but not for Pre-K.

03M165,NYC_parent12,manhattan,Elementary,395,"This is a stellar school in district 3! My child is in the dual language Kindergarten class at PS 165 this year and I am thrilled with this school. It has exceeded my expectations and I believe it is a hidden gem in District 3 that many families aren’t aware of. My kid is excited to go to school every day and has made a lot of friends.

The teachers at PS 165 are top notch! They really care about our kids and are passionate about their work. I have volunteered at the school a lot this year so I have gotten to know several of the teachers and have been very impressed by their commitment, enthusiasm, creativity and focus. They take every opportunity to develop new programs and evolve their curriculum. I also feel the teachers help cultivate a culture of inclusiveness – the children I have observed seem to treat their peers with respect and kindness.

PS 165 is a Showcase School for Math. Having a strong mathematics program was really important to me while searching for schools for my child. Considering the fact that the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked the United States 40th in the world for math literacy, I greatly respect that the school is being recognized for improving its teaching methods in math so that our kids can be on par with students around the world.

The school also puts a strong emphasis on reading and writing and I have been happy with the progress my child’s kindergarten class is making in literacy.  

I can’t say enough good things about the Spanish-English dual language immersion program! It is utterly incredible to watch my child progress in a second language that we don’t speak at home. I am now often getting corrected for my rudimentary Spanish (that I learned in high school in the early 1990s) by my Kindergartener! I can’t wait to see my child’s level of fluency by 5th grade!

Perhaps one of the most exciting things that is happening at the school is that the technology coursework is being transformed so it will be STEAM/MakerSpace focused. It is in its early stages but will be scaled up and the goal is that our children will become trained to be creators of technology and media instead of consumers of it. Already, coding has been implemented into the curriculum and my kindergartener is already doing things that go over my head!

Lastly, because I personally have always been more into creative subjects, I just love the school’s art program! The school has a kiln, so all the kids learn pottery, and I have noticed my child’s artistic initiative and ability at home greatly improve since starting at the school.  In addition, our kids are learning guitar every week in music class! I am hard pressed to imagine a more well-rounded education that my kid could get at any other Manhattan public elementary school.

Are there any drawbacks to the school? Well, I think no school is perfect. I will say that the building, although bright, spacious and clean, is very old and doesn’t have elevators, so severely physically disabled children (or their disabled parents) would have to choose another school that is accessible. Also, for parents who like extremely progressive schools, this is not one of them. PS 165 definitely embraces the whole child philosophy but is more academically rigorous (without being suffocating) than some other schools, though I do believe that the staff still provide a very nurturing environment for children. I also believe that our children will be more academically prepared for the challenges of middle and high school.

The PTA at PS 165 is active and very dedicated. A lot of great parents dedicate so much of their time to initiating events and addressing challenges. 

Please note that as of September 2018, PS 165 will be only a K-5 school, and will no longer have a middle school.  In general, the middle school test scores were lower than the elementary school’s but because both schools were tallied together as one school, the average overall scores were brought down. In the past, many of PS 165’s high performing students have gone on to attend some very competitive and high performing middle schools while MS 165 would accept students from other elementary schools that didn’t offer such strong academics to prepare them for junior high school.

Honestly, the best way to know if the school is good for your child is to tour it and get a real feel for it. I am embarrassed to admit I had many misconceptions about PS 165 – based on outdated reviews from various sites, tests scores and an overall lack of knowledge about the school – and wasn’t even going to consider it until I visited it for myself and spoke to parents there. Anyone who wants their child to get a well-rounded education that includes strong math and literacy programs but also gives him/her the chance to learn a musical instrument and enjoy a wonderful art program should definitely check out PS 165.",0,0,0,2018-03-16T15:26:31,1.0,0.11900000000000001,0.203,0.061,0.674,0.218,0.565,0.038,0.134,0.585,0.228,0.318

03M165,Sharon,manhattan,Elementary,395,"My daughter attended preK at 165 last year and is currently enrolled in Spanish dual language kindergarten. She did well enough on the G&T test to receive a district G&T offer at another school, but we decided to stay at 165.

I had some trepidation about the school culture, namely, would kids be nice to each other? I can truly say that both the kids in her class and the older children on her floor (preK, K and 1st grade share the 2nd floor of the school) have been remarkably kind and supportive of each other. PreK kids have their own bathroom in their classroom, but K and 1st graders leave the classroom with a buddy and go to the bathroom down the hall. When walking in the neighborhood after school, my daughter has pointed out other little girls on the sidewalk, saying “I know her! She helped me with the paper towels,” etc. The principal has brought Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” into the school through The Leader in Me program, and seems sincerely committed to the initiative. 

http://www.theleaderinme.org/

One of the habits, “think win-win,” is particularly well-suited to a zoned neighborhood school. Parents and schools obviously should work together for the children, but sometimes it can seem like an oppositional relationship. I do think Principal Castellano cares about the students and wants them to do well. 

The teaching staff in preK and Kindergarten are uniformly good. Some schools, even ones with good reputations, allow ineffective teachers to linger, but I have not seen that at PS 165.

When I read comments here, I like to know something about the person writing them, so I’ll say that on the progressive/traditional education philosophy spectrum I’m in the middle – it’s important to me that the curriculum be age-appropriate,  and that a school be aware of the significant cognitive change that happens to children around age 7. 

To go back to The Leader in Me initiative, one of its tenets is “Instead of seeing children through the lens of a normal distribution curve—some kids are naturally smart and others are not—The Leader in Me paradigm sees that every child is capable, every child is a leader. This paradigm changes everything.” Instead of “Educators control and direct learning,” the Leader in Me process moves toward “Educators empower students to lead their own learning.”

 https://psms165.org/leader-in-me/

On the downside, recess and lunch are too short. Kindergartners have 47 - 50 minutes to eat and burn off steam, and I believe it remains the same through 5th grade. However, that is a problem at every zoned school in District 3.  Administration has shown commitment to an outdoor recess, and the school usually has two play yards, although only one is operational until a major roof repair is finished.

I’ve watched the K/1st grade recess from across the street many times, and I‘d encourage prospective parents to do the same. While some school aides behave very differently when the Vice Principal is present as opposed to when she is not, I’m confident that my child is safe at school on the playground, in the bathroom, and in the classroom. I don’t mean just physically safe but also safe from teasing & meanness. I’ve observed my child’s classroom teacher intervene when kids are not getting along, and she handles it exactly how I would hope she would. For example, with teasing, she calls attention to the reaction of the teased child: “Look at Billy’s face. Does he like what you are doing? No? Then stop doing it.” And the kids do. She is teaching them empathy & awareness of others every day.

The test scores published on insideschools include the middle school (grades 6/7/8). This is why test scores on insideschools are lower than the state test scores in the Kindergarten handbook published by the DOE, which only includes 3rd/4th/5th grades. If you are considering PS 165 for elementary school, the DOE handbook gives a more accurate picture.",0,0,0,2016-12-23T19:57:09,1.0,0.11900000000000001,0.203,0.061,0.674,0.218,0.565,0.038,0.134,0.585,0.228,0.318

03M165,Golbarg Bashi,manhattan,Elementary,395,"We are family with 2 children in PS. 165. One of our children used to be enrolled in a different school, so we have experience of different public schools and we are educators ourselves, albeit in higher education. We are disheartened to see personal attacks and non-constructive comments on the school's administration and principle here. As parents it is our responsibility to empower the school, so leaving anonymous comments, attacking the very people who are responsible for our children's education, care, and well-being, and threatening to abandon the school, is truly not in our children's best interest. We too share some (not all) of the concerns that are voiced here, but believe that pulling children out of the school and/or making damaging statements about their school principle/administration in an online forum is counterproductive. 

As many have already mentioned, the school's teachers are truly exceptional, highly educated, caring, and competent. The school has one of the best dual-language programs in the city. The building itself is beautiful, clean, spacious, and located in a wonderful neighborhood. Our own encounters with the principle have always been cordial and helpful. 

In our view, the few issues that do need immediate attention are as follows:

Solution for the busy and loud lunch-room: fewer classrooms in lunch-room at any given time. Different staff/method for keeping discipline in lunch-room.

One of the school yards, the one which is directly attached to the school has been under construction for far too long, which has not only deprived the kids from play there but has made pickup time rather unpleasant as one has to go to crowded, exceedingly loud gym to fetch the children instead. Please note that there is another school yard, a bigger one which has provided space for play but doesn't have direct access into the school. Solution: expedite the construction in school yard!

While school yard is still under construction, a handicap ramp/access MUST be installed for strollers (as currently entry into school is very arduous if not dangerous for those with strollers).

Having mentioned these few issues, that surely exist in most other schools, we are confident that with a positive frame of mind and a generosity of spirit, we can all help address them. So, instead of demoralizing the principle and her staff, we need to offer our confidence, our time, and our expertise to this exceptional school.",2,0,0,2013-06-25T16:09:00,1.0,0.11900000000000001,0.203,0.061,0.674,0.218,0.565,0.038,0.134,0.585,0.228,0.318

However, it's remarkable that the gains made under Gallini can be undone so quickly under the current administration. The teachers are absolutely top notch and in the classroom I feel she's getting a good education. However, outside the classroom the school is a mess. She fears eating lunch because there seems to be very little supervision in the lunch room. There seems to be very little discipline and interest in addressing the behavior of some of the rowdy students.

03M165,PS_165_parents,manhattan,Elementary,395,"We have several children in the school and have had personal experience with a number of teachers. Every single teacher we've had for our kids at PS 165 has been excellent:  committed, diligent, caring, communicative, unbelievably hard working, smart, and more.They care deeply about the kids and when we ask other parents about the school, we ask, ""Are your kids happy?"" Ours invariably are and theirs usually are. We evaluate the school in 4 categories: teachers, parents, admin, physical plant. We rank it as follows: Teachers: A+ Admin: C (with some exceptions, see below); Parents: B (those involved are very much involved but there are many who are not involved because they are working and do not have the time); physical plant: B. The observations  below and of most parents, involved or not, are that the new administration: principal, some assistant principals (though not the AP for the middle school, who seems very good), and ""dean"" are mediocre. They don't exhibit the leadership, involvement, and abiliies that the parents want ,and they don't communicate or interact with parents well or enough.  That said, they are not horrible (see teacher feedback on principal of PS 87 for that) they are just overwhelmed, bureaucratic, and not that good. The question is how much weight you place on this problem? Clearly the admin should be there to support the great teachers, help them deal with the sickening DoE bureaucracy, and get them what they need to do their job. Currently, the teachers have to do much more with less support to get their job done than they should with a supportive administration. The way to fix this imbalance is for more parents to be involved and to move out this admiistration (which happened two principals ago and that person was really bad). In the private sector, they'd certainly be fired but it would take a review process. .

The source of the problems we all know. The lack of efficient leadership. The principal, Ms. Castellano is no where to be seen or heard of. There's so much potential for this school. The school was at the brink of greatness just one year ago when Mr. Gallini was principal. This shows that all that PS 165 needs is a strong leader, or perhaps simply an efficient one for the school to thrive. The PTA is a small one (due to lack of administration support, many parents just give up), but it is dedicated to achieving greatness in the school. Parents and teachers at PS 165 do most of the heavy duty work, without complaint. We WANT the work of building an ideal educational environment. Once under effective leadership, PS 165 has shown it can stand on its own. Unfortunately, I fear the foundation and strength of the school will (if it isn't already) dismantle very soon. Parents such as myself can't afford to risk and gamble with our children's safety and future. I know the next and predictable outcome will be good teachers leaving.

My children love The DEAN at PS165 the find the dean to be fair and someone who they could go to when they have an issue. My cousin also attended PS165 and remembers The dean as a substitue teacher. But the dean is not to be alone with students. He mentioned that all the kids loved the dean They feel that the dean is very approachable. I am a strong believer if you have something to say about someone you should confront the person and tell them how you feel. If your accusations are substantiated then why worry about a backlash. Lastly shouldn't this forum be encouraging to parents that are looking into this school for their children so why bash your workplace with your opinion. So to parents looking into having their child go to PS165 I have seen it be a very inviting school with wonderful caring teachers (with the exception of the basher who obviously is putting their personal feelings before the schools best interest). The staff goes beyond to make our children as comfortable and confident in their school.

They are nearly equal in terms of the education your child would receive. The teachers sometimes rotate from G&T into gen ed and vice versa.

This is done at the DOE level. Second, this school has more programs to try to mix the G&T and gen ed groups than virtually any other school I've heard of. For instance, PS166 PTA shares money across all classes evenly, even though most money is raised by the G&T parents. The PTA pays for teaching assistants across all classes evenly. The school has several programs which combine the two groups--the dance festival; the music programs in the fall and winter; the afterschool program has scholarships to ensure that anyone with lower incomes (in other words ALL children from BOTH programs) can participate in the school play and the other amazing afterschool programs; parents, afterschool teachers, and regular teachers volunteer to teach for free (often) kids who need extra help academically and in the various arts programs; PTA money provides funding for underprivileged kids to attend the 4th grade trips and 5th grade graduation; all kids are welcome to attend the several other enrichment programs won by grants and other (mainly G&T) parent efforts, such as music lessons, robotics, chess, and the devoted science room, teacher, and curriculum; the school administration has reading programs which criss-cross both the two programs and grade levels, to ensure that mentorship takes place among the children; children switch classrooms (G&T to gen ed and vice versa) for certain classroom projects (such as a long-term writing project in 5th grade last year) then return to their regular teachers; G&T teachers rotate into gen ed classes for some years and vice versa, all but eliminating the differences in education between the two groups; many long-time PS166 families with several children matriculating there have opted to place their kids some in gen ed and some in G&T because the education in both are so similar and excellent. Because the two programs are so fully integrated at this school, there have been several calls to eliminate the G&T program entirely.

03M180,Evelina401,manhattan,K-8,430,"My Grandson came to PS/IS 180 in 2004 and upon entering the lobby I immediately felt like I wanted to register/enroll him as a student.  The lobby is warm and inviting and very clean.  I notice that on the right wall in the lobby there are pictures and essays of students who were chosen for student of the month in academics and citizenship.  I was given the opportunity to meet and speak with Ms. Lambright who has now retired and she was instrumental in telling me what the school offer their students and what I would need to do as a grandparent meaning volunteering time in the school and making sure I attend the monthly PTA meeting.  She also gave me a tour of the PreK classes.  I am extremely overall please and satisfied with the education my grandchildren are getting.  Since my grandson enrollment his two sisters are now also students at PS 180 and, I must add they all are very happy and love their teachers.  Yes, there are challenges along the way but why not have some.  We need our children to be challenge to prepare them for the future.  Learning shouldn't be easy.  Our children need to learn to be thinkers and doers.  Also all students at PS/IS 180 has the opportunity to participate in sports, music, and its chess program. The school has Talent Tuesday whereby all students explore their choice of talents whether its jewelry making, dance, double dutch, etc. to keep them involve in extracurricular activities.  In Conclusion, in my opinion Dr. McFarlane mission is to ensure that all his students get the education they rightfully deserve to prepare them for the future regardless of ethnicity, economic status, race, or religion.  Thank you very much Dr. MacFarlane.

03M191,J.O.,manhattan,K-8,475,"Our son is currently enrolled in PreK at RSMA / P.S. 191. He tells us that he’s happy with his classmates, loves his teachers and enjoys his lessons. He comes home with diversity in learning such as: singing songs learned in one week, bringing different types of artwork and discussing human nature. His homeroom teachers are wonderful – they instruct the children on a solid foundation of basic learning from the alphabet, numbers, analogy, etc. as well as guiding them in emotional development outside of their home. He had attended programs at Dwight, Mandell, Metropolitan Montessori and MetroKids - all from which he really benefited and thrived. My husband and I had researched as many schools possible - both private and public, in the UWS and Midtown area; and we’re happy with this academic program and close-knit community promoted. The enhancement teachers (music, movement and art) are wonderful and have connections with Juilliard, Laguardia HS, etc. Mandarin begins weekly this month for PreK and the lower grades. The after school program for PreK is Hudson Guild and pick up is by 6PM for about $400-500/month. Kindergarten-6th Grade after school is the YMCA until 5:45PM; and it’s free. The school was built around 3 years ago (the first “new” Manhattan school in about 30 years) and the classrooms are very large with lot of windows - each with their own bathroom and access to a private playground – it’s just as described on their website with state of the art technology from touch screen teaching monitors in every classroom (I’ve only seen that in charter schools so far), 3D printers, computers in every classroom and the library. The administration is very involved in the student body’s academic and social well-being. The interim principal, Mr. Stephen Hernon, is intelligent, friendly and respectful with the students, the teachers and administration team. The parent coordinator, Ms. Damaris Carrion, (she’s been there for about two decades) is the school conduit and has been instrumental in the transition of the school’s relocation and development. There are five PreK classes - many children enrolled are zoned for P.S. 199 or P.S. 452. I believe RSMA is the only public school for which the DOE provides the assistant PreK teacher for each class. Other area public schools’ PTAs/PAs raise funds to pay their assistant PreK teachers’ salaries. RSMA is the only area public school that currently has no suggested annual contribution minimum. I have been quoted at other public schools’ annual amounts from $300 to $2,400. Our PTA is a terrific group of parents and teachers who are effective as they are cooperative. They started the school’s first annual fundraiser party 3 years ago and it’s been very successful. The school has a progressive type of Gifted & Talented classes – the teachers elect students starting in 3rd Grade.

03M191,V.W.,manhattan,K-8,475,"I am a parent to a student that reside at this school and my other child will be attending next year. I will say I as a parent like some teachers at the school but not all. If you really ask me I will tell you that the Parent Coordinator (Ms.Damaris Carrion) should run as Principal cause she shows interest in the kids and parents needs. She is a wonderful person and helps alot when it comes down to that school. I personally feel she can show the structure and love and guidance the kids will need. She always show interest in families by doing activities for kids and parents and help them also by running fundraiser to help kids in the school with what ever the child needs. When it comes down to the safty of our kids I can say the School Safety dose they job, not only they do they job but they help these kids with what ever they need as of emotions when the child is mad or sad they help prevent them from getting they self in any trouble. I see how kids and parents come to them for help when it comes down to the kids cause they safty are first. They are very respectful, loving and caring people that does they job and protect these kids and do they best from any harm. I feel that the principle does not give school safety or half of these teachers credits that they deserve. I feel like she needs to be more dedicated to the children and parents to the school i feel like certain things isn't non of her business when it comes down to if a parent is comfortable to talk to a teacher or school safety about anything, she should be glad that parents can open up to these people in the school about anything that contains them or saftey or home issues then preventing these kids or parents feom opening they self up to the parent coordinator or school safety cause i feel like they are the ones that help parents and kids from causing ruckus in the school.

03M191,JClark,manhattan,K-8,475,"My daughter had an amazing first year at P.S. 191. The staff go above and beyond to create a warm environment, hosting several culturally themed events to ensure everyone feels represented. The G&T program offers a rigorous curriculum, which prepares students to perform well on the state exams. Yes, the test-prep is intense (one critique that I have), but schools must perform well to maintain student enrollment, and secure funding. In that regard, I understand the catch-22. The enrichment programs are an additional benefit, as students have access to the Juilliard music program, drama, and art (to name a few). The music teacher (Ms. DJ), who is largely (if not fully) responsible, for integrating the Juilliard program in this school, is phenomenal. She is so committed to ensuring her students are exposed to the arts, many of whom had little to no prior experience playing a musical instrument. Despite her student's novelty, she embraced them with open arms. The parent coordinator (Ms. Damaris) spends countless hours planning elaborate school events to strengthen the school community.  Lastly, the after-school YMCA program is amazing. Mr. Desmond (the coordinator), Ms. Jasmine (a counselor), and Mr. Jesus (a counselor) are so courteous and upbeat. They genuinely adore kids. What more could you ask for in a school? Staff members who genuinely love kids and enjoy what they do.

03M191,S.H.,manhattan,K-8,475,"This school is simply like any other middle school, but worse. I came into this school during sixth grade and I can say as a former student, my experience was not pleasant. I'm unsure as to if everyone experienced what I experienced in middle school or if it was just RSMA. The school was moved into a new building and the building is beautiful, however the people in it aren't as good as the outside seems like they are. Some of my innocent friends and classmates were picked on and harassed for things beyond their control such as hair, smell, birthmarks, appearances, sexuality, wealth, disorders, etc. Teachers are constantly disrespected. I don't think there has been a day where a certain math teacher of mine has gone home without feeling gloomy due to the amount of disrespect that is thrown at her. Kids are constantly cursing at her, threatening her, calling her names, and it is truly a miracle she hasn't left this school yet. The students here are not respectful at all, especially in the upper school. The school doesn't seem to take higher measures on this either. A friend of mine was slapped in the face and bullied for a whole year, and while, the teachers noticed this, they didn't do a thing at all and seemed to just watch from the sidelines as my friend who didn't seem to do anything wrong was crying and being bullied. There are also fights everyday, as it seems the kids are easily influenced to participate in physical violence, rather than using their voice to settle a matter. There should be consequences to these actions other than suspension, lectures, calling of parents, taking away privileges, or other ineffective measures. This school is not safe and I was constantly living in fear and anxiety of being picked on or having something worse done to me, although I am pretty sure from what I experienced, it already has. I am unsure as to whether the behavior of these students is due to the school environment or it is just themselves. However, one thing I am sure of is that middle school wasn't it for me and in this school, it may not be for your child or you either.",2,0,0,2019-04-12T02:10:51,1.0,0.08199999999999999,0.278,0.10099999999999999,0.753,0.21899999999999997,0.669,0.057,0.345,0.488,0.086,0.375

There was even a violent incident during the school day where almost the whole precinct was called in.  I was in a PTA meeting  and was held captive in a lockdown and got no information what was happening if my child was effected. Further more my 5 year old was exposed to a child throwing chairs at teacher and unacceptable language.

03M191,A.C.,manhattan,K-8,475,"I was at the same PTA meeting, am a parent on the School Leadership Team, and our family has attended PS191 for the past three school years. As communicated in a debrief by Principal Keville at our SLT meeting a few days later, as well as via a letter sent home through all students, there was a parent in the main office (not a student), that required the police to be called. The emergency procedures taken were executed per the DOE required school safety plan, and was intended to minimize disruption to the students. It was not the case that students were exposed to a ""violent"" or unsafe situation. To note, over the past three years we have been in attendance, there were two prior incidents in the surrounding neighborhood - a shooting on a construction site, and the bomb threat at Time Warner Center - in which similar emergency procedures were executed. RSMA staff communicated those procedures to families in a timely manner and also hosted additional info sessions on safety procedures and how students and staff prepare in drills. When asked, none of the shelter-ins have resulted in my child reporting disruption or distress. 

For those who have feedback on communication or safety procedures, I invite you to attend monthly SLT meetings in which there is an open forum for family and community members.

03M191,L.F.,manhattan,K-8,475,So by your own admission nothing was explained on this day.  Second the letter sent home was extremely vague a parent who wasn’t present would not know the level of panic that one would have experienced. Incidents involving parents and police aren’t normal. So no matter how you try to frame it what I wrote stands true. And the fact that this school has a week administrative staff that allows bullying and inappropriate things to happen stands incontrovertible.

03M191,A.C.,manhattan,K-8,475,"I am a parent whose aim is to raise children whose excellence expands beyond test scores to encompass an academic and professional future driven by hard work, self-awareness, purpose, and desire for positive impact in their communities. I thus looked for a public school environment that would support my children in academic growth, socialization and problem-solving among classmates who represent the socio-economic diversity that is NYC, exposure to a depth of curricular enrichment (fine arts, language, music, dance, maker), and increased cultural sensitivity via national heritage celebrations, community activism projects, and study of self-identity. Upon my first visit to PS191 on a Pre-K tour (when the school was located in the older building), I immediately felt the warm vibe of community that I sought for my son. In our family's last 3 years of attendance (Pre-K, K, 1st grade), RSMA has surpassed my expectations on all of the fronts I desired and I have had the pleasure of watching my son grow into a high achieving, well-rounded, empathetic, and engaged child. I learn from him, his teachers, and the many school-hosted family activities. I am confident that as he continues his journey through middle school at RSMA, the staff and curricula will guide him towards being a confident, committed, and curious learner. I am even more enthusiastic in seeing his baby sister start Pre-K in a few years, as the friendly school community already recognizes and welcomes her. 

For a historically under-resourced public school, I am constantly impressed by RSMA's level of commitment to innovative learning and finding ways to accept and empower students that may be marginalized elsewhere. Whether it's a first grade field trip to see Faith Ringgold's 125th Street Station mosaic murals of Harlem Heroes and Heroines, to a night of sharing food and traditions at the Family Multi-Cultural Fair, to tinkering with MakerState scratch-coding and 3D printing, RSMA students gain exposure to powerful futures of what is possible, as leaders and pioneers, and with paths forward to getting there.",0,0,0,2019-03-18T02:57:26,1.0,0.08199999999999999,0.278,0.10099999999999999,0.753,0.21899999999999997,0.669,0.057,0.345,0.488,0.086,0.375

But, there is much more to this school than its building.  This is truly a community.  You see and feel that from the moment you arrive.  Principal Kelville often greets each family and/or student when they arrive and with each ""hello"" you can tell that she cares for each and everyone of the students.   I've watched her talk to students who may have been absent the day before to see if they are feeling better - or to understand if there's something else going on.  Every student has a healthy respect for her and she shows it right back.  That ""community feeling"" permeates throughout the halls - from the security staff, to the librarian, to Ms. Jones (the art teacher) and Ms. M (the dance teacher) - RSMA has such a wonderful sense of community that by the time I get to the classroom I'm reminded that my daughter is in safe hands.  And her teach - Ms. Manigault - is the B.E.S.T.  She could really be called the G.O.A.T.  She sincerely cares for each child and works with them where they are to succeed.  My daughter far exceeds the normal milestones for her age/grade due to the curriculum and individual attention that she receives in the classroom -- and the reinforcement of that at home via the homework packets.  Yes!  Pre-K has homework -- so that the children can learn the education lessons AND the lifelong lessons of responsibility.  I can't say enough great things about RSMA.

03M191,chuey101,manhattan,K-8,475,"My son is a 1st grader this year and has been a student since Pre-K.  The growth he has experienced in the past three years is tremendous.  Starting with Ms. Edwards PK class, he gained valuable social emotional skills as well as an exposure to guitar (Ms. Edwards plays) and sign language.  His guitar interest has since grown and has become a core personal interest and discipline for him.  In K, Ms. Dixon made such a huge impact on my son's reading skills that we are still blown away to this day.  At the start of K, my son was still sounding out letters and vowels.  By the end he was reading at level D to E, effectively reading comic books on his own.  His growth was exponential.  It has continued through to 1st grade with Ms. Sydney who is a recent addition to the staff and a super star.   In addition to taking my son's reading to level L and beyond, she is a caring and nurturing teacher who also helped to build a sense of community and empathy amongst the class.  We just finished our parent teacher's conference yesterday (which btw is student-led, my son presented and discussed his own work!  very effective method and great for parents) and we couldn't be more proud.  Academically, my son is currently above benchmark, but more important than that, the social and emotional skills he has gained these past three years is irreplaceable.  There is something intangible but hugely valuable to be gained when a child spends time getting to know and working with other classmates that may have different interests, backgrounds and means.  This is something that I think is largely overlooked today in lieu of keeping up with the ""rat race"".  The irony is the rat race has proven to be an effort with diminishing returns and increasingly high barriers as the college application scandal this past week has come to exemplify.  To parents who have that inkling that there may be another, better way, a road less travelled perhaps, I recommend taking a look at RSMA.

03M191,C.T.,manhattan,K-8,475,"My son graduated RSMA's middle school last June. He has severe ADHD and experiences intermittent focus lapses across activities. He is an amiable, creative boy who typifies the struggles of a different learner. RSMA staff engaged my wife and I in a partnership to identify effective strategies to maximize our son's academic and social success. After some initial fits and starts, the teachers and staff found an effective, multifaceted approach to motivating and supporting our boy in class, while we provided reinforcement at home. This collaborative and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of a special needs student exemplifies the effectiveness of RSMA's parent-teacher compact. Working in concert, the staff across grades and subject areas, were able to help our son explore and refine his creative ability, maximize his social emotional development, improve his academic performance, and build self-confidence. The unleashing of his creativity, through STEAM/Maker learning, positioned him to excel in architecture and digital design in high school. Of course, our son's special needs persist, but now he's armed with the knowledge that he can achieve on a high school level. Thinking back to our quest for a middle school, I remember the indecision my wife and I had in making a choice. We had several choices that various people recommended to us, and who knows - they might have worked out. One thing we know for sure - we made the right choice for our son. Despite the social trials and tribulations of middle school, and the challenges of a unique learning style, our son recently said that he really misses his middle school. He visits often and looks forward to alumni events in the future. We asked him why he likes going back - he has a pretty exciting high school life to occupy his time. With a big grin, he recently told us that RSMA is the place where he found himself.

The school is not equipped to give kids a solid education after PK-K, and they graduate 8th grade absolutely ill-prepared for high school. Behavior problems are also an issue that the school cannot cope with. Additionally, the school has major communications problems that they refuse to acknowledge and recognize, much less fix. The administration is overwhelmed and does not understand the value of supplying a good foundation, but instead focuses on looking good on paper, e.g. funding for a media lab or a drive for a library that they do not have programming for. There are a few dedicated teachers, but the bar is set very low overall, so everyone's expectations about what can be accomplished are minimal, even the good teachers. The school has very few mechanisms for parent participation or involvement in their children's learning experience--ex. graded assignments are kept in a portfolio that does not come home and is very difficult to get ahold of (we tried, multiple occasions, with multiple teachers). Another example of how extreme the problems are is the lack of consistency in whether and how the teachers communicate--we had some take over a month to answer initial emails, and others who never answered. Despite extreme efforts on our end, we have very little idea of what is happening in the classroom. Every time we brought up any one of these issues, the school would give a ""well what happened that time was"" excuse. The move to the new school is going to decrease the quality of education even further, as they are administratively overwhelmed as it is. The principal loves to say that she ""can't wait to see the faces of the kids on the first day,"" which is indicative of exactly her approach--shiny toys to distract from solid plans to improve education, discipline, and the kids' day-to-day experience. We feel we would be remiss in not warning other parents of this terrible choice in schools that again, looks good on paper because of the funding here and there for programs that do not exist or are temporary by design (ex. Mandarin).",0,0,0,2017-06-09T00:56:04,1.0,0.08199999999999999,0.278,0.10099999999999999,0.753,0.21899999999999997,0.669,0.057,0.345,0.488,0.086,0.375

Also you could then cause under-enrollment in the grades above K by taking such an approach.",2,0,1,2014-06-12T14:15:45,1.0,0.027000000000000003,0.187,0.018000000000000002,0.127,0.013000000000000001,0.07400000000000001,0.161,0.045,0.094,0.625,0.071

03M199,Joseph Smith,manhattan,Elementary,822,"I feel bad for the stress this is causing for many area parents.  I did have a couple of questions though.  I would think the PS199 principal would be very sympathetic and making sure her office is being militant about the address verification requirements.  Should that not be weeding out most people who are pretending to live in the zone when they don't?  Also I believe they do have at their disposal the ability to call for a physical address check where someone actually goes to the address itself.  Seems warranted in this case.  Is that being done?

03M242,Theresa L.C. Hammonds,manhattan,Elementary,121,"For new parents looking at Harlem Public Schools and considering giving them a try, I offer two very enthusiastic thumbs up for Young Diplomats Magnet Academy (YDMA). My daughter recently graduated and is heading to middle school. While we are both happy that she is appropriately transitioning to middle-school, we are also both completely saddened by the idea that we will be leaving our local fantastic school. Our journey at YDMA began in first-grade, and I can honestly say that my daughter has thoroughly enjoyed calling YDMA her home school. She has benefited from being taught by master teachers in almost every grade she has attended, as well as, receiving awesome support inside the classroom and out. In 2013, my daughter broke her leg, we were thankful that we attended our local school because after a week she was back in school and the school did everything possible to accommodate her needs without my prompting. They (the Principal and staff) probably do not know to this day, how much I appreciated their support during that crisis.
I also want to give a plug to the International Baccalaureate (IB) designation received by the school in 2014. The Principal and her staff worked very hard to achieve this goal. I can say that through instruction, project work and an environment built around IB attributes and attitudes, my daughter has become a much more globally aware individual, who is also a budding feminist. I firmly believe her development at YDMA under the IB curriculum has had a lot to do with the positions that she now takes. To boot, the fact that she stakes out a position is a direct result of the instruction she has received (I should probably take some credit here too!)
Finally, it is unrealistic to suggest that this or any other school operates without deficits and/or problems. There have been many negative comments on this site about leadership. I cannot agree with what is said here, as an engaged parent who sat on the SLT and the PTA, I always found the leadership to be responsive to me in my advocacy for my own child, but also in advocacy for every child in the building. One glaring problem that exist at the school is minimal parental involvement, we currently have one of the hardest working PTA Presidents, who has done yeoman's work to corral our parents. This is an area that is still a work in progess, and it is my hope that should you decide to attend this school you will be prepared to roll-up your sleeves to work for the continued improvement of this school. That is what I did, and I can say that in the four years we were there, the school achieved its IB status and improved upon a host of other issues. This school can only get better, and it will especially do so if parents in the Harlem community embrace it and work with the leadership and the master teachers in the building to make it the exemplar of a public IB school it is destined to be.",0,0,0,2016-07-27T17:50:54,0.75,0.083,0.38,0.057999999999999996,0.8420000000000001,0.298,0.769,0.0,0.603,0.34700000000000003,0.008,0.38799999999999996

03M242,barrimom,manhattan,Elementary,121,"This school might or might not be the place for your family.  

It was definitely NOT the one for ours!

First, let me start off by stating that our child enjoyed this school.  Our child’s overall experience was engaging and positive---particularly in the classroom. The school environment seemed to be safe, colorful, orderly and relatively clean.

Nonetheless, due to poor leadership, the overall school culture left much to be desired.

PROS: 

This might be the place for your child if you can settle for and want:

...to see many teachers and office, nursing, and support staff seemingly take pride in all that they do to nurture students and interact positively with parents.  Many appear to enjoy working with the children and take seriously their job of helping students learn in a safe environment;

... to see the same group of adults appear happy to take on the challenge of contributing positively to the lives of students and their families; and,
 
... to give your child  a chance to benefit from a well presented magnet themed program.  However, as I will explain below, family
engagement and parental voice within this program is not encouraged so it may be difficult to identify these benefits. 

Apparently this problem is not new to YDMA. 

See page 5: http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2011-12/Quality_Review_2012_M242.pdf

 CONS:

 This might NOT be the place for your family if you aim to experience....

...an administration driven environment aimed at preparing students to achieve far beyond DOE standards. One that encourages students to aspire to become college and career ready global competitors from day one;

...a proactive administration led staff that emphasizes a welcoming attitude towards receiving parent feedback, with a goal towards encouraging student achievement for all students; 

...an overtly accessible and responsive administration that encourages steady dialogue amongst all adults on a routine basis. For example: instead of waiting to have issues addressed at parent/teacher conferences, why not send out regular student progress/performance
reports?;

......a place where it is clear that punctuality across the board (and from top to bottom) matters; 

…..a place where the school's dress code, and student preparedness for all tasks and assignments is encouraged; 

.....an overall sense of transparency.  For example: in the areas
of staff retention, professional development, family outreach, and community building so that all adults who invest their energy in the students can have a highly effective impact on them for the long haul; 

This might also NOT be the school for your family if you want to experience... 

....an administration that routinely demonstrates that the school is a part of the local community and authentically embraces your child or children as their own without appearing arms-folded defensive and annoyed;

 ....a family-type culture regularly encouraged within the school by the administration between all staff members, students, and their loved ones. A culture that is not only aimed at supporting the teachers, but helping the students excel by endorsing parent/teacher partnerships. For example: parents should be invited to be more engaged by visiting classrooms during instructional time, not only to assess the
learning progress of students, but to showcase teaching, activities, and projects; 

….routine and accurate written communications that provide parents with reasonable notice and reminders of ALL school related events, half days, closing, etc. For example: updating the school website and sending out bi-weekly e-mails/text messages to parents might make things easier for everyone. This school's practice of disseminating newsletters that contain informative teacher summaries *shortly before* or even *after* key events is counterproductive;  

....an administration that effectively balances school security with maintaining an inclusive atmosphere. One that encourages security agents to be stern, but mindful of the need to treat all parents with respect—especially at the start of a school day.  A friendly attitude would help as well.  I agree with another reviewer (on another
school review site) who said that agents (clearly supported by the
administration) treat parents like criminals. 

To observe, on a regular basis, the corrections officer-like behavior of the security agents at this school is disheartening to say the least.  Their negative energy is exacerbated prior to school events in the auditorium when parents are first corralled into the cafeteria and then to the very back of the auditorium for the duration of presentations. The administration needs to understand that the message conveyed is: 'you parents are still outsiders even when we let you in'.  The students at this school are not inmates and pick up and drop off/pre-presentation practices should be revamped.  Otherwise, I suspect the avoidable tensions in this small school will persist;
 
and lastly, this might NOT be the place for your family if you are looking for:

....a wealth of enrichment and/or after school programs to compliment the school's curriculum and mission.  

Once the school leadership and school culture issues became clear to our family (about 6 weeks in) and many others for that matter, we set our child onto a path out of this school and toward a number of other traditional public and public charter schools.

03M242,Concernedformerparentofydma,manhattan,Elementary,121,"PARENTS BEWARE!!! One cannot be distracted by the
clean, friendly “look “of this school.  After
only   3 months of attending this school,
we pulled our children out as this school is dangerously lacking in SAFETY. The
leadership at this school is very weak and you see evidence of that in many
ways.  My daughter was always frightened
to go to school because how badly the kids hit and kick. Drop-off and dismissal
are both confusing and lacking in order. Use the right exit and you could leave
out with a child without any adult noticing. What is equally disturbing is my
son was involved in several incidents of fighting and bullying that were never
communicated to me by the teachers. My son shared how much students use profane
language to his disbelief as he knows this is not tolerated in other school and
after-school environments. I have sent several emails to Principal Desjardin.  The only time she responded to me was when I
informed her that my husband and I were withdrawing our kids from the school.


 I felt like I was
pulling teeth when I wanted to talk to my children’s teachers about the basic
things such as homework, tests, etc. When speaking to the principal about it,
she told me I must make an appointment to speak with my children’s teachers
(even if I have a few, basic questions) and appointments can only be made
during the day. 


There are many parents who are concerned about these very things;
however, there aren’t enough written complaints about it. Changes are made
within the school or by the DOE only when PARENTS PUT COMPLAINTS IN WRITING because
if there’s no record of your complaint, it didn’t happen. 1) File a complaint
with the DOE by calling 311 (u can do this anonymously or by using your name).
NO COMPLAINT IS TOO SMALL. 2) You can also call 311 to file another (City Dept)
complaint about the specific faculty member(s) so that the complaint would be
added to each person(s) file. 3)  Write
emails to the Principal instead of talking it over during “Tea” or calling her
cell so that there could be no denying of what was communicated (ask me how I
know).  Although the person that will
investigate your DOE complaint – the current District Parent Advocate - is a
joke as she is friendly with the senior staff, what cannot be erased is the
pile of complaints filed against the school and its faculty. 


It is a necessary means to achieve the desirable end, which
is to have a safer school environment for our children.


As one parent noted, I don’t doubt that the complaints on
this thread are being drowned out by faculty members posing as “super elated”
parents because I have seen what these adults will do to cover things up. If
any concerned parent is need of info and/or support, please contact me at concernedformerparentofydma@yahoo.com.

Students are provided with the tools to be inquirers and researches of topics that are important to them and are encouraged to take action to positively influence social change. YDMA provides the same opportunities to its parents. In building a strong school community, parents are encouraged to participate in family fun days, workshops on literacy and mathematics, a monthly chat with the principal ""Tea with Ms. D"" and information sessions on the International Baccalaureate Philosophy and parent participation.

The administration and teachers do set up a boundary for parents that serves its intended purpose: to make the children responsible for handling their learning, time management, interpersonal issues, etc. Frankly, I'm glad they don't pressure me like our UWS elementary school to constantly volunteer and get in the building under any pretense.

I can say with certainty that if you are undecided between another school and the Center School, you should definitely pick the Center School. This school has shaped who I am today. Some of the teachers may look intimidating but it's very clear that they think of their students a lot and try to do their best for them; I went and visited a week back but they all still remembered me and greeted me very warmly. They are simply great people that I respect in so many ways. If you want your children to have a personal education, I suggest you pick this school.

The mixed grade system was intimidating for me when I was a 5th grader, as the ""big kids"" knew so much more than me and they were all so tall! But I can assure you that by 8th grade, I did more than just finding my place within the school; I made very dear friends of all grades and learned to communicate better. 

If you want your children to go on to a specialized and ""advanced"" school, maybe you should pick Delta or the Computer School.

03M243,guest,manhattan,Middle,241,"I attended the tour and decided not to apply for either of my children. I found that the approach sounded great for some children. The operative phrase here is ""for some children."" This is important to note because Center is often touted as the Way Schools Ought To Be For All Children. My impression is that Center has some great ideas and, as with schools with other focuses, it is indeed great as long as your child is ready for whatever they're doing and is excited about whatever they're doing. The Center system objectively is not any better than any other, however, in my opinion. Notice how Center recruits kids one year earlier than the other good middle schools of the district in order to glean the very few kids who have the exact profile that Center knows does well in its system. Put other kids in the Center system, and the record of educational success that Center shows might change somewhat. (I would guess a lot, actually.) LaGuardia, for example, is also a great school but only great if your child is very arty and willing to work. It would be terrible for a very unarty mathy kid, obviously, assuming that they somehow got in. Similarly Center School works well for kids who are interested in seeing material which is above normal age groups. 5th graders see what 8th graders are ready for such as R-rated films about political issues (Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michale Moore). Center is great for kids who can stay organized above the normal level, because they have relatively large numbers of courses that stretch for several weeks alternating with courses that stretch extremely short period and so courses start and stop at different times and they also stretch into upper grade levels. Projects can also extend beyond class boundaries. It can get confusing if your kid has ANY organization issues at all. Center's is a much more complicated system than a straight-ahead traditional middle school-system like Delta and certainly more so than the progressive-middle school alternatives like Computer and MHII. MHII actually test your kid's organizational abilities and places him/her in appropriate classrooms to meet then extend that ability. So for instance, kids still building organizational abilities are placed in a 6th grade class where the kids all change rooms together, have more limited number of teachers, and the rooms are grouped close together. Center is also great for parents who don't want a very hands-on approach nor an individualized education for their child. Some of the schools, like CS and MHII the systems allow for more individualized education. On a continuum, Delta is least individualized. CS is more individualized because it has some ability-leveled classes like math. MHII much more individualized because within a single classroom often the teachers are prepared to give your kid what he/she is ready for at the moment and stair-step up from there to bring him/her to level and above. Plus MHII is willing to call a parent any day of the week to discuss current progress and alter the child's education accordingly and MHII has extended parent-teacher conferences and several other ways to keep parents involved in individualizing their child's needs. Center I know from parents who've left the school has been known to be unresponsive to feedback from parents and working around kids' individual needs. Going back to the continuum, I'd place Center between Delta and CS in terms of individualization and parent involvement, ranking above Delta only because it's so much smaller, allowing for probably some additional level of individual attention. The bottom line is that all of these schools are good. Center is good for your child if your kid is very organized already, is very mature in terms of not being scared or offended at age 10 by materials intended for 17 year olds, if he/she can already understand what the teachers want and need from him/her, and if he/she doesn't need very much academic support. If your child is still skill building in any of these areas or, God forbid, has an actual learning disability, Center's track record of support isn't so great.",13,0,0,2012-02-10T14:51:20,1.0,0.0,0.187,0.0,0.20800000000000002,0.017,0.11199999999999999,0.062,0.13699999999999998,0.191,0.5479999999999999,0.012

03M243,indigopoe,manhattan,Middle,241,"Hi, I’m wondering if anyone could offer any advice to me and my situation: My daughter and her father and I are going through the 6th grade admissions process, and what I am sensing is that there are mainly 2 kinds of public MS’ in district 3: those that are geared toward kids who can perform excellently on standardized tests, and those that are newer, more experimental, less racially/socio-ecomomically balanced and seem to consist of kids that, frankly, my daughter has little in common with and are in environments I’ve heard have had significant bullying problems.
I, myself, graduated from Anderson, before it was a “school” and was merely a “program” in the P.S.9 building (and right before they added a 6th grade, too!). I would love nothing more than for my daughter to have an experience such as the one I had in Anderson, at that time, with the diversity of race, different learning levels, etc, however, the fact is: my daughter simply doesn’t test as “well"" as I did at her age and she learns and is inspired differently than myself academically, overall.
The ONLY school we have seen so far that seems a good match for her is MSC (M.S.333), but given that there are so few seats in the incoming 6th grade class coupled with its popularity, I am obv worried…
Can anyone give me any insight regarding what other schools may be comparable to MSC in the ways that it isn’t primarily a “test oriented” school and has a very diverse student body, etc?

2. It is common for different people to have different experiences at school. Why would anybody want to lie about being bullied on an anonymous website? If somebody comes up and says that they're being harassed at your school, and you say that you've never seen this, then the answer is probably that you are both telling the truth. Your experience simply isn't universal.

3. ""Just ignore the kids"" is bad advice that never works. If a student is getting harassed at school then the school has a problem and needs to work to fix it. As an adult, I can tell you that I know multiple other adults who have severe anxiety, depression, or even PTSD related to being harassed at school and having staff refuse to handle the situation. If people have given YOU this advice then you need to know that these people do not have your best interests at heart.

03M245,A Student,manhattan,Middle,403,"This is my last year at The Computer School and oh boy how am I going to miss it.  I have had some of the best times of my life here, and have made friends that I will have forever.  I know all of my teachers and some who don't teach me (the ones I know are certainty AWESOMELY AMAZING), they all seem to care about how others and I do.  Even when I've struggled because I didn't do my homework or didn't understand the material, teachers were always there to help.  A couple of them even made me stay after school, or during lunch to finish things.  That isn't to stay that I have never gone to my teachers voluntarily, I do so often.  In fact in my art class I was behind on the last project I had to complete, so I came back to school at 3:45 (the school day got out at 2:30) since there was a teachers meeting, to finish my art.  It's not like the teachers are trying to force you to do your work (I hope you understand what I mean) but they encourage you and make you want to do it.  Honestly I wish they would make The Computer School into a high school so I wouldn't have to leave.  The Computer has prepared me for all the state tests I've taken, me and four other students (who are currently in the eighth grade) actually managed to score in the top 2% out of all the students in NY who took the seventh grade ELA test.  I also got a high 4 on the MATH state test.  The 6/7 system with classes is great, I know it helped me get integrated into The Computer School and I hope I helped some of the sixth (now seventh) graders who were in my class last year become integrated into The Computer School.  We all learn from each other here, I know I help and have helped several of my teachers with technology, (not to say that they're bad with computers but a couple of teachers aren't the greatest with computers) I know I have learned so much here. (I'm really happy I didn't go to Delta)  The guidance counselors have helped me immensely with getting into a high school.  I was late 69 times last school year and I managed to get into a good high school. (I'm elated to say that I have been late 5 times this school year)  The classes are always engaging, the teachers are very good at doing that.  The teachers actually come up with lessons together a lot of the time which kind of makes it so no one class does better than other.  Thats not to say that teachers don't make accommodations for kids, they do. The Computer School is amazing and I'm going to miss so much, I kind of wish I didn't have to go, I know I'll come back and visit The Computer School and talk to my old teachers.  I know that if I need help in high school I can always email one of my teachers, this is an awesome school!",0,0,0,2012-03-07T16:01:35,0.75,0.017,0.21600000000000003,0.015,0.335,0.042,0.243,0.077,0.127,0.29,0.444,0.059000000000000004

03M245,guest,manhattan,Middle,403,"It's very hard to compare the strength of the academics as both programs somewhat tailor to your child's strengths and weaknesses. They are both very strong. Both are progressive, in that they have projects that combine subject areas across disciplines. CS in 6th grade gives HW that doesn't just want regurgitation of facts. They purposefully stair step the thinking level from concrete to abstract. They want the kids to begin synthesizing new ideas from outside sources including their own brains. Some are able to do this right away. Some aren't. It's a developmental thing and CS is poised to capture this gently. Given that both schools are progressive, I would say MHII, though, is even more focused on creating cross-discipline projects, which are also rigorous and aimed at your kids' abilities. The summer homework for 7-8th grade was interesting in that they combined the math with literature. An 8th grade math project this year integrated making a ken ken puzzle (not just solving it) and then step by step the kids had to describe in words the thinking process of how they came up with the answer to each square. Incredibly good analytical skill-building! And fun.  The strength of the programs also depend on the needs of your child. If your child is ready for strong work--or isn't--MHII has several levels of choices, often within a single classroom. The idea is to reach and capture kids then pull them up. MHII is great with social-emotional too. I would say on the whole that the education that is focused more on the individual development of your child with the most flexibility is MHII, although CS has leveled education as well. I've been delighted with the care (not coddling!) of the MHII staff and principal. 2-3 minute parent teacher conferences at CS and as long as you need at MHII. Free parent entry at MHII, open hallways. CS is somewhat more restricted. Shiny and fresh looking school at CS, MHII seems to care more about its kids than how it looks, although it's very homey feeling.

I have successfully been teaching high school since I left and have never met anyone in my admin as crazy as this lady- and I've seen A LOT of admin come and go over the years.  

If I tell colleagues now how this principal behaved, they either laugh their heads off or gasp, or both.  I have a lot of weird teaching stories from NYC, but I have never laughed about this nutjob.  That would be like laughing about a horried car wreck where you escaped permanently damaged.  This woman damaged my spirit.  I will never return to NYC or middle school because of her.  She stole something from me.

I learned that anyone can be a principal and thrive in NYC (this principal was a mere 32 yrs old the year I worked for her!! with no other school experience other than MS247).  She is a monster.  She should not be in a leadership position or anywhere near kids.  ",20,0,1,2011-09-24T22:55:40,1.0,0.25,0.264,0.005,0.856,0.159,0.805,0.009000000000000001,0.013999999999999999,0.955,0.023,0.142
03M247,Anonymous,manhattan,Middle,220,"Warning to new teachers who choose to work at this school:

The commentary here is spot on.  You'll be working for a tyrant.  The principal is the only administrator running this tiny school.  There are no checks and balances with this person and she has a complete obsession with control.  She knows her rules and she knows your rights better than you do.  So it's easy for her to blame and discredit you using all or any obscure rules and regs she can pull up.  

This is easy to carry on with new teachers because there are a million things you won't know upfront.  She will sniff out individual minds she can't manipulate or control and target you for extinction via the rule book if she wants you out.  By this, I am saying that she doesn't necessarily pick on you due to incompetency.  And even if you are a weak teacher, the manner in which she will attack you is uncalled for and unprofessional.  I saw teachers crying here every week!!  But I hesitate to call any teacher here weak.  These are all new teachers who mostly need to be mentored and guided and nurtured.  Attacking them for their inexperience is simply one of her creepy war tactics.

This principal isn't about nurturing.  She missed her calling as a drill instructor and believes cruelty and abuse will either put you in line or break you down enough to leave the school.  If you don't get her approval, you won't have it from the others either. She convinces other staff that you are basically destroying her school and horrible for kids and turns the weak ones (who usually receive favoritism) against you.  And since she generally likes to work by the book and follows rules to a ""T"" no one ever suspects her of lying or twisting facts when she chooses to do so in order to bully and discredit you.  I found her personality frightening!!  Ethics and morality and compassion are only useful to her if they don't disturb her control.

When I worked here she kept the union rep on a tight leash and he was NOT there to protect or inform teachers.  I learned this prinicipal was a former union chair so you can bet she knows your rights better than you do.  But she only uses them to scare and manipulate you and prefers to keep you in the dark.  

Granted, if you are not in the middle of all this, I am going to sound like some disgruntled former employee.  She is fabulous about putting on a show for important visitors.  She is all about test scores and appearances.  That's what the higher ups and parents seem to be moved by and she knows this is how to manipulate what they see and understand about what happens at MS247. Even you will be fooled the first time you meet her.   

I see that she wants this school and students to be better but many of her efforts are misguided.  Interrogating kids in your class, or hiding outside your door to find out what you are *really* doing isn't professional.   She didn't use the eval/observation process to help you improve when I was there.  Asking you to work impossible hours without compensation or efforts of appreciation is just wrong (only her favorites get compliments).   Asking for all your assessments to review and making all your copies and rejecting things she doesn't approve of shows she has no faith or trust in you as a professional and you will feel like a child under her leadership.  Asking you teach classes or run clubs you are not trained for and then terrorizing you when you're not perfect is just twisted.  Watching your every move and blowing all things out of proportion when you don't do everything right is just stalkerish and overdramatic.  Reprimanding you in front of staff and students is demoraling and cruel.  Turning kids against you is just weird and gang-like.  She won't tolerate crying from students and she will think you are dirt when she makes you cry (and she will).  She actually suggested I had mental problems when I cried in front of her once.  ONCE.  She seems emotionally disconnected from the mental cruelty she imposes on you which is just.... sadistic.  She has no problem attacking you personally and this is harassment.

She fails to see the importance of anyone else's opinion, she will never admit she is wrong or makes bad decisions, and her obsession with control and perfection won't allow her to see that young teachers need to be appropriately mentored-- not abused because they don't do everything perfect.  

My heart goes out to the students and teachers she bullied.  I honestly felt I had PTSD after escaping this school because I had to put up with long term mental cruelty and emotional abuse. I tolerated so much more than I had to in retrospect because I didn't know my rights.  

If you work here and feel you are being treated unprofessionally, I urge you to document all of these principal's words and actions.  Get support from outside of this school from other union people and admin who can help.  It should help, but ultimately, I believe this principal is a product of the system and thrives here because it's almost impossible to prove how unprofessional she really is.  Most teachers she bullies simply leave to escape her.  

Do not trust your first impressions.  This admin and her school are not what they appear to be.  There is a lot of unseen emotional turmoil among this staff and definitely an atmposhere of terror.  Save yourself the grief of being bullied or the grief of helplessly watching your colleagues be bullied and work somewhere else.

The first time I sent a student to the office, some minutes later another student returned to my room, looked at me with disdain and shoved a post-it note at me from the principal.  It read, ""REFLECT ON YOUR MANAGEMENT!!!  SEND WORK!!!""  What kind of ""leader"" does this to her staff?  Do you know what it's like to be reprimanded by the principal in the middle of class via post-it note and a 7th grader with attitude?  Unfortunately, this is Ms. Aguirre's bizarre and sadistic management style.  Nonsensical abuse.  If you tick her off, catch her in a bad mood, or if she decides you simply just don't fit in,  she turns kids against you and does absolutely anything it will take to sucker punch your morale.   This principal needs to reflect on her management and what it means to be a leader.  Sadly, I don't think even an interpersonal relationship course or a leadership course could help her.  She does as she pleases without consequence and knows she can get away with it because she's the only admin and teachers just leave to get away from her.

Almost 25% less than one year!  Principal Claudia Aguirre has been the principal of this school since 2003 and has had little success keeping good, experienced staff.  When you chase that many staff out of your school year after year, you have to stop blaming teachers for absolutely everything and question the leadership and the overall professional climate.  It is a disservice to students to have so many new teachers in the classroom who are going to be in survival mode and learning the ropes every single year.  Good schools have teachers who never want to leave.  They stay and master their subjects.  Good schools nurture their teachers and support them and offer opportunities to grow and develop professionally.  Good leaders respect and inspire their staff and make them feel like part of a team.

03M247,anonymous,manhattan,Middle,220,"Oh lord, thank you!! thank you!! to the teachers who have recently posted their honest thoughts and experiences with this school!  I taught here for one year and was completely traumatized by this principal.  And why?  Because she tried to cover up a poor decision on her behalf and set out to discredit me so she wouldn't look bad.  She hired me in my subject area and then when school started she told me I was to teach a very technical subject I was NOT trained to teach!!  I was not put in my subject area AT ALL.  As a new teacher to NYC I didn't know that I only had 48 hours to submit a grievance for being given a schedule 100% outside of your credentialed subject.  She exploited me.  I was not disrespectful but I expressed my discomfort to this principal, Claudia Aguirre.  Boy did this upset her.  She just doesn't accept complaints or resistance... you will do whatever she asks even if she has to shove it down your throat.  I was stuck in that uncomfortable position and she wrote me off from the start.  She literally stalked me all year and set out to discredit me at every turn.  She even made up lies.  I couldn't believe a principal could act this way.  She never, and I mean NEVER, had one kind word to say to me or one supportive thing to offer.  She just wanted me out.  It was the most bizarre experience I have ever had in teaching and to this day I have never seen a principal behave so cruelly and unethically.  You don't set teachers up to fail this way.  At the very least she could have helped me to be a better teacher in the subject I had ZERO training for.  Instead she was mean and vicious and put me down on many occasions in front of other teachers, office staff, and students.  I can't even begin to explain the injustice I experienced here.  And what did I do?  Nothing wrong.  Nothing... I did not deserve what she did to me that year.  I did my best to adapt but her abuse and constant attacks made it difficult to focus on teaching at all.  When I finally left it was like being rescued from HELL.  Literally.  She plays creepy mind games with her staff.  She always acts like you're in BIG TROUBLE walking around with a union rep who behaves like her henchman.  I can only say you have to be in it to understand how completely incompetent and unstable this principal is in the area of nurturing teachers.  It's like you ARE in middle school and the biggest bully around is after you.  Claudia... if you read this... SHAME ON YOU for what you did to me... to US ... ALL OF US.

03M247,Cmbiannuzzi,manhattan,Middle,220,"As the saying goes, nothing good lasts forever.  The original founders of the school had the great concept that children should be proud of their heritage and then go on to incorporate the new culture in which they now live.  Also, to become proficient not only in their native language but as proficient in their second language. ""El que sabe dos idiomas cuenta por dos.""  Bilingualism in this world is a key to success.  That being said, a school is not a totalitarian state.  It ""takes a village to raise a child"", well it takes not only a good leader but good teachers.  Who are equally invested in having their students succeed.  Dual Language has and has had good teachers in the past.  However, teachers cannot function in an environment where they are harrassed, bullied and treated in an unprofessional manner.  Cooperation between the principal and the teachers needs to exist.  Yes, guidance can and should be provided by a principal, not confrontation and undermining of confidence.  After having worked there many years, I too saw many able teachers leave because of the work environment. No amount of supplies, computers, grants, and trips can compensate the support and encouragement needed by a teacher every day.  Even the most dedicated (and most try to stay and endure) get worn down by the ambiance. I wish the school well always.  I, like most of the teachers with whom I served loved and tried to do our best for the students.  I hope the principal forgets about stats and scores and remembers that it's the teachers, in their classrooms, on a daily basis that makes or breaks a school.

When I was there many of the teachers felt there was more of an emphasis on projects and pretty things that can hang on the walls to impress visitors than there is on reading and writing.  It's my belief that this principal has avoided a union movement against her because she keeps a tight leash on the union rep and tends to hire inexperienced teachers who don't know their right... and who usually run for the hills once they experience the abusive nature of this principal.

Now that our son enrolled it, i must say, that is too bad because our son is totally blooming here and his really getting confident, which we think is one of the key point for a pre-teenager and for his future.

The teacher community is really amazing, professional and supportive to parents and more important; to the students. They seem to be proud to be part of the ""family""; They can anytime reach out with one of them to catch up during lunch time or after class. 
The Principal, Brian Zager, with his crew is really engaged and wonderful to students. Our child is depicting a great athmosphere, a close relationship to other classmates and students (no matter grade, gender or Ethnic background).

Regarding after school programs they introduced a theatre program with a great teacher (class in French langage) this year. 
The school was recently honored to be one of  the top schools level in french dual language program in the world. (ask more infos on that to the Office!)

03M256,In The Know at 256,manhattan,Middle,153,"It is rather remarkable how many lies and falsehoods are presented as fact in the two posts below.  I could write a book detailing how wring these posters are, but what good would that serve?  The self-appointed representative of the ""concerned teachers"" ignores his or her own shortcomings (along with the colleagues he/she claims to represent) and blames everything on the principal and assistant principal.  In fact, many of these ""concerned teachers"" were far more focused on holding students accountable (code for punishing them) then with making sure they learned.  This is pretty accurately reflected in the Common Core test data - especially in 7th and 8th grade Math, where not one student scored above a Level 2. Literacy scores in Grades 7 and 8 weren't much better and, not surprisingly, the 7th and 8th grade math teachers both left the school (along with the 7th grade English teacher).  The school also didn't meet expectations on the 8th grade state Science exam and that teacher also left.  Noticing a trend?  Let's not forget that teachers taught those classes - not the principal or the assistant principal.  Did many teachers work hard and do their best?  Of course they did!  But their best wasn't good enough and the principal and assistant principal made them aware of this fact.  Apparently these people are in denial about their skills and are far better at giving criticism than receiving it. 


Did the principal put the needs of the students above the needs of the teachers?  Yes, I would say he did.  And he actually listened to what students had to say, as opposed to throwing everyone in detention all the time for the most minor of transgressions.  The principal thought his job was to make sure that students were learning and had a voice, not to make sure all the teachers were happy all the time and were allowed to do whatever they wanted without consequence.  It's true that there was no school-wide detention.  It's also true that I don't know one parent who considers this to be the most important service a school offers.  


Don't believe everything you read on this site as there are definitely two sides to this story.  And yes - many teachers and the principal did leave MS 256 at the end of the 2012-2013 school year, so anything you read here is now already out of date.  If you're considering MS 256 for your child, visit the school - talk to the new teachers (I hear they are amazing) and the ones who stuck around (quite a few did!), as well as the students and parents.  Most of them have nothing but good things to say about the school.  Then decide if it's a good fit for you.  I'm not making a recommendation one way or the other.  I just want you to be informed.


Oh - also take note that the French Dual Language Program did not launch this year due to low enrollment.

03M256,In The Know at 256,manhattan,Middle,153,"Dear 8th Grader - you make some very valid points.  Yes - teachers can only do so much.  In many ways, the same is true for the principal as well.  A principal (or assistant principal) can't teach all the classes for the teacher that is struggling.  Administrators can't write all the lessons and hold every individual student accountable for everything he or she does each period.  If the principal could do all this, then there'd be no need for teachers!  The principal does need to support and help teachers, do his or her best to make them better, and hold them accountable if they never show improvement.  You are 100% right, a class cannot be taught if students are unwilling to listen and focus.  The same is true for a teacher who is given strategies to use to help get the class to listen, but ignores them because he or she ""knows better.""  In an effective school, the teachers and the principal work together to solve problems and support one another.  Sadly, regardless of who has been the prinicpal at MS 256 over the last few years, this has not been the case.  This isn't to say the principals didn't try - I am sure they did, but the results weren't what they could have been,  You are correct that improvement should not be about pointing fingers, it should be about working together.

What superintendent would fire a principal if they ""put the needs of the students above the needs of the teachers?"" Such a statement exposes an inherently divisive attitude.

03M256,MS 256 Concerned Teachers,manhattan,Middle,153,"The post below is largely accurate. At least 8 out of 16 teachers are leaving at the end of this school year. Many of these teachers (as well as those who are staying) are wonderful although not perfect, and they worked as a team to sustain and improve the school. This comes on the heels of another mass departure of teachers three years ago. Even the principal himself tried to leave by proposing this past spring to open his own new school in the city.

The school has no detention. There are no consistent consequences for bullying and aggressive behavior. Day in and day out students get away with conduct that interferes with classes and makes others feel unsafe and vulnerable. Students regularly curse at teachers and other students, students regularly cut class and come late to class and school, students regularly ignore requests to follow school rules, and nothing happens the same day or the next despite immediate documentation by teachers. Parents are rarely summoned except in the most egregious cases. Students learn the lesson that they can do what they want to adults and other students without fear of repercussions of any kind.

The principal and assistant principal spend most of their time in the office. They very rarely enter classrooms to work with teachers or students, and when they do the students tend to act even worse. They have little idea, even in general terms, what students are studying at any given point.

Co-taught ICT classes are often left with only one teacher to cover them. New teacher mentoring is a sham, used as cover to justify poor reviews given to newer teachers who understandably struggle. Teacher observation reports are regularly returned months after the observation is conducted, and they are riddled with falsehoods and misrepresentations that they hope the teachers will overlook.

The community partnerships listed above are not accurate. The school does not have a relationship with Morningside Center, ENACT, or the Schubert Arts Foundation. In 2012-13, the school had a part-time music teacher, bringing the joy of music education to students for the first time in years at the school. This teacher was not invited back for 2013-14. Money that would have supported the position will instead be used to pay for a full-time AP for the 165 student school. 

Read the DOE learning environment reports for the last three years. Read this past year’s report after it is released later in the summer (but do not believe that 95 percent of parents responded to the survey this past year; this is a fabrication).

It is worse than you can imagine, and the blame falls squarely on the principal and the AP. If your child is going to go here next year, prepare to be shocked at what they, and you, will see and hear.",2,1,0,2013-06-29T20:48:58,1.0,0.124,0.203,0.0,0.746,0.203,0.608,0.006999999999999999,0.47700000000000004,0.359,0.124,0.25

03M256,anonymous,manhattan,Middle,153,"I know the ins and outs of this school. I know staff dynamics, teacher-student interactions, and the politics within the school. Due to the outdated and vague description of MS256, I take it as my moral responsibility to shed some truth to all the good-hearted, decent human beings out there who should never have to deal with the level of unprofessionalism in which this school is drowning. Whether you heed my warnings or take it as a grain of salt, if you choose to work at this school, I am confident that you’ll come to realize all that I have written here is true.

I shall start out by saying that the teachers are the ones who have poured their heart, blood, and sweat into improving this school. Ironically, the teachers are rarely recognized for their hard work. Instead, they are constantly undermined, ridiculed, or dismissed by the administration. Teaching is hard enough as it is, seeing how we are responsible for the academic future of all our students, but rather than receiving any support, teachers are left to fend for themselves. The only way you can possibly get support is if you compromise yourself and your pure-intentions of why you started teaching in the first place. There is a pungent unspoken agreement between these “compromisers” and administration. One of the mottos that seems to be running between them is: if you have my back, I have yours. And what about the teachers who stick to their pure-intentions and refuse to “drink the kool-aid”? Well, let me just say that currently, there is a mass exodus in this school. As the principal has said a couple of times this year, “I’m the principal, I make the decisions, and if you don’t like it, then you can leave!” 

The principal is quick to side with the students rather than ever giving teachers the benefit of the doubt. Thus, a message is sent to all the kids that they can do whatever they want. Oh, am I failing a class in Mr. X’s class? Well, I’m going to talk to Mr. Perl! And what happens as a result to this kid whining and complaining about failing Mr. X’s class because she refused to do any work or pay attention in class? Mr. Perl undermines the teacher by basically allowing this particular student to pass. This is just one in the multiple cases where he has done that. Thus, every student in this school knows that they can do whatever they want...which means they treat teachers with the utmost disrespect...and if the teacher addresses this to the principal, the principal dismisses it...

The parent coordinator and principal are among the best in the city. There is open communication between students, parents, staff and administration. The teachers are enthusiastic about what they teach and engage the students in meaningful work, not busy work. There were many opportunities to explore educational and enriching experiences outside the classroom including museums, broadway plays, the HighLine and countless others.

My child graduated last year and got into their first choice high school, Essex Street Academy. As a family we owe a lot to the great staff and the good friends my child came to make. The whole system works to support the child both academically and emotionally. My child learned to be organized and take pride in delivering high quality work. They excelled in reading and qualified for a scholarship to the Summer Institute for the Gifted program. Their skills developed in all areas, and they had fun with programming, public speaking, and art. They were offered many chances to develop new interests in science through enriching weeks at the Natural History Museum, exploring archeology and astrology. They got to create a show at the Planetarium! 
Emotionally these years are a time of self-discovery. My child came out as Trans, and Ms. Fazio helped them to start a Gender and Sexuality Alliance club. The kids had weekly discussions, raised money for good causes, and everyone got to see a  Broadway show. I know as a parent it meant everything to me that the staff and teachers helped my child through such a sensitive time with dedication and compassion.

They believe in their students potential and achievement and go out of their way to offer continuous support by either working with students during lunch time or after school. When teachers should be taking a break, they are working with students by either allowing them to make up missing work or giving them a welcoming room to hang out in. There's a real feeling of community within the school and you almost always see teachers and students with smiles on their faces. Although some students might not recognize all the great things about this school while in they are there (UGH teenagers, am I right?) year after year us former students come back to visit our CAS teachers and show off our glowing high school report cards.

He has built good relationships with his peers and of course has teachers he leans on. I truly appreciate them all and grateful for the open communication I have.

She started 6th grade bellow grade level in the ELA test, but  by the end of 7th grade, she scored above grade level in the ELA state test.

03M258,Michele Sweeting-DeCaro,manhattan,Middle,239,"Greetings. I am Michele Sweeting-DeCaro, and my son has been at CAS for two years now. My husband and I love the school, but our prince loves it more! His first year was a bit tough as it was an adjustment, but with the support of his teachers, administrators, and some classmates, he was determined to make it work--and he has. One of the many highlights of CAS is the extraordinary teachers who are educated and dedicated in their craft to pull the best out of their students. Furthermore, the teachers are no-nonsense when it comes to behavior. As my husband and I are graduate school and college professors, respectively, we take academics and behavior seriously. Principal Sullivan and V. Principal Sinnott are always available to speak with parents, and the entire CAS team cares about the whole child. Our son is thriving at CAS, and I would say one main reason is that the teachers allow students to do extra work during lunchtime; they allow them to make corrections on tests and overall give the budding scholars chances to move on to victory. I would be remiss if I did not share about the wonderful work of the CAS speech teacher, Mr. Goldman. Our son receives speech therapy from Mr. Goldman and between Mr. Goldman's strategies and our son's determination, his speech has improved dramatically; so much so that he spoke to his classmates--openly--about stuttering and how it makes him feel and what they can do to help him. Our son received a standing ovation by his peers that day, and this is to the credit of Mr. Goldman. I can continue to share about CAS from the academics to the advisory to the after-school programs, CAS is a gem of a school. As an SLT member, what we NEED is parent involvement. Studies show, ""A parent's interest in and encouragement of their child's education can affect the child's attitude towards school, classroom conduct, self-esteem, absenteeism, and motivation. Parents should stay involved in their children's education from preschool through to high school (Strategix.com, para1, 2016).

My son came to CAS strong in Math and Science but weak in reading and ELA. During the end of the first quarter,  I sat down with the advisory staff and my son. We established his weaknesses and recommended interventions and we were all on the same page. The end of the second quarter, my son won the spelling bee. I got a call from the school phone at around 11.30am. The first instinct was, is there a problem with my son? Oh, it was my son so excited and couldn't wait till evening. He was gasping with joy and as he had  promised, he also made it to the upper principal's honor roll. His ELA and reading level is above the set goal. All this is possible because the administration is fully involved and the teachers are awesome,  helpful and caring. I can't wait to bring my daughter to CAS.

If there were any conflicts happening between students, Mr. Curry(the principal) and Mr. Sullivan would quickly and efficiently resolve it so that the education and well being of the students is not disturbed by any dispute. Teachers challenge their students to begin to prepare them for High School. Speaking of High School, this school offers many resources for parents and students to help apply to High School. The guidance counselor, Ms.Tejeda, will always be there to help with the application as well as answer questions. There are also many clubs that students could sign up for such as soccer, visual arts, baseball, chorus, etc. The school is kept very clean and neat.

If my son misses a homework assignment no matter what subject, I get a call from that specific teacher the very same day. Mr. Curry the principal and Ms. Fittipaldi the parent coordinator both know my son well even though it has only been 2 and a half months since school began. My son mentioned to me how ""nice"" the vice principal is, and he ""really likes"" all his teachers. I was a little worried in the first few weeks of school which seemed to be slow paced and made me wonder if I had made a good decision choosing the school, but I soon realized there was nothing to worry about when my son began to talk to me about everything he is learning in almost all subject areas! My son, excited about school! Wow. I guess the teachers simply make that extra effort in the beginning of the school year to get to know your child's strengths and weaknesses to have a better understanding of your child's academic needs. On curriculum night is when I realized how fortunate my son is to be in this school. I got to see all the staff and meet all his teachers and even heard from the lunch lady who prepares them healthy meals from scratch (they prepare the food at school, pretty much like home meals). It's a new initiative. When my son heard (on curriculum night) her say they will be serving brown rice he was depressed, that is until he tasted the delicious ""homemade"" chicken. And what can I say about the after school clubs? Yoga, chess, photography, drama and more! I fell in love with this school for its small, close warm family feeling vibe that the staff (especially the parent coordinator and principal) emanate. When was this review written?

The principal, Jessica Jenkins, and all the teachers have exceeded our expectations with their dedication and hard work, and my son is thriving at WESS.  We decided, last year, to ""first choice"" WESS, after listening to Jessica Jenkins give such dynamic presentations at our elementary school, and describe her vision for this much needed new secondary school in District 3.  Although there wasn't an actual school to tour yet last year, Jessica won us over with her great track record (building a successful middle school in Staten Island), and her goals for what she wanted to achieve at WESS. 

Using the Expeditionary Learning model, which is basically ""best practices"" for teaching and learning, the students are challenged with exciting lessons, set and strive to achieve clear goals, self assess and revise.  Student-led conferences,  presentations of learning, Crews (advisory groups), expeditions (units of study), using New York City as a Learning Lab, are all a part of Expeditionary Learning.  WESS teachers use Standards-based grading, which describes clear goals, standards, and rubrics, so students can reflect on their work, and possibly revise it.  With this grading system, teachers know which students are meeting the standards and which still need help. WESS students also have great options for electives and after-school activities.

Parents of WESS students are encouraged to participate in the school community, if they can.  Some opportunities are being involved in the PA and SLT, being a Crew parent, joining book clubs to learn about the educational philosophy of WESS (EL), etc.

The school is located in the old Beacon High School building, and has already been spruced up.  The classrooms have been painted, the furniture and computers are brand new, each classroom has a smart board, and the library has brand new books appropriate for 6th-12th grade.  Every student was given a Google Chrome Book to use for school and home work.  There are plans for more improvements to the gym and second floor.  It's a warm and inviting environment for all the students.

Upon hearing Jessica's presentation about what was then a soon-to-open new school we had concerns about whether it would all come together and be as good as we had hoped and as Jessica envisioned but we took the leap of faith based on her personality and her success having started another school prior to this one.  We have been given everything we were promised and more.  Jessica's team of teachers and staff are as dedicated as she is.  The Expeditionary Learning model is a fancy term for how all teaching should be done.  Goals are set, kids are taught and challenged, meaningful (but not onerous) homework is assigned and then very specific feedback is given via standards based grading.  Standards based grading is a system whereby feedback is given to students frequently and on all areas of the work they do.  There are many line items where you can glean much information about what your child is doing well with and what they do not understand or perform well in. Work habits are also graded as they should be. The social skills that kids are also learning by being treated so thoughtfully is invaluable.  The kids learn how to speak in front of one another, talk about their work to others, lead their own conferences, present their work.  It is a remarkably comprehensive learning environment and the best part is that the kids seem quite happy, engaged and proud of their school.  A few more details... The school, while in an existing building, is clean and is furnished with new everything - from furniture to books to technology.  It is a bright, inviting place to be.  The after school opportunities are varied and engaging and the school spirit is high.  I'm sure I could go on....",0,0,0,2016-02-13T19:39:48,1.0,0.006,0.223,0.0,0.201,0.040999999999999995,0.10800000000000001,0.08,0.045,0.201,0.64,0.063
03M291,Lauren Gale-Napach,manhattan,Middle,314,"So if you are looking for a downside to West End Secondary School, you won't find me revealing one. We have had children in the NYC public school system for almost 20 years and for the first time in all those years, I can truly say that we have found a school that delivers what they promise and is in alignment with our philosophy when it comes to its approach to learning. You almost would not believe that this is a brand new school. Jessica Jenkins has moved West End Secondary into the District 3 neighborhood as if she has been here for years. She understands the parents' uncertainty and anxieties around placing their children into a school without any track record. She works with us and challenges us to look at education from new perspectives. She also puts the parents at ease by the very fact that she is extremely clear about the what and the hows of Expeditionary Learning and is always taking steps to make sure the parent body understands it as well as she does. Jessica has the experience and the background and a success record to back herself up. Yes, of course there will always be a learning curve with anything new, but Jessica has thought a lot about what this would look like and how she would make it happen and she is committed to her vision. 
The expeditionary learning model offers the children a structure in which they can self assess, be accountable, and reflect on not only their learning, but on their personal values. The school lives by and instills their own core values into the everyday learning throughout each academic subject. The core values of West End Secondary School are Creativity, Wonder, Compassion, and Resilience. Our children are getting a rigorous and in-depth education through each section of learning, or expeditions as they are called, as well as whole life experience around discovering who they are and how they choose to be in the world. The homework is thoughtful and challenging without being overwhelming and mindless busy work. Even all of the electives and after school activities are engaging and have been well thought out. There are many after school options (ie. track, cross country, soccer, math team, debate team, Wess Players musical theater, music, Green Club, Student Council) and great electives like hip hop/jazz through Alvin Ailey,Take-Two Film Academy where the kids make their own films, jewelry making, orchestra, art and more. Another wonderful aspect of WESS is the advisory, which they call Crew, which most middle schools do not have and not even all high schools have. Crews are small groups of students who stay with one another throughout the middle and high school years who come together with their crew leader 2-3 times per week to discuss various topics. Because they remain in the same group every year, the kids will have an opportunity to bond over time. I look forward to all that WESS has to offer throughout our years there. I always have a lot to say about this wonderful new school that my child is lucky enough to attend.  For a brand new school, WESS has it all going on!",0,0,0,2016-02-12T22:49:48,1.0,0.006,0.223,0.0,0.201,0.040999999999999995,0.10800000000000001,0.08,0.045,0.201,0.64,0.063

It breaks my heart to see the difference from a few years ago - everyone was excited to be at the school and now everyone is rolling their eyes and wondering what is happening and what to do next.
She cited increased math scores last year which is laughable given the many classrooms with so many issues. The reason the math scores went up  (slightly) is because parents in the school saw what was happening and enrolled their kids in tutoring services. So, sorry Claire, the scores are up but no thanks to you. 
Unless Claire goes, this school will continue to decline. It is already losing so many of the things that made it special. It is clear Claire does not believe in those things: in progressive education, parental involvement, etc. She lets lots of things happen that should not  be happening and would not have been happening a few years ago.

When you take the tour, they show you the hydroponic greenhouse. They don't show you the library because there isn't one.

We transferred out for middle school as did other families. Every year the children celebrated with a ""moving up"" ceremony.

I also have taught her that everyday we wake up is a celebration and no matter what holiday it is we embrace it. Understanding that everyone doesn't celebrate holidays, we don't throw parties but we do small gestures to remind us what day it is to keep us going. Feeling as though our freedom of speech is taken away, I have logged complaints to stop her from stopping the children from wearing what they see fit. In these critical times that we are in, hearts should be the least of her worries.

I've previously written a comment about MSC explaining my thoughts towards the school. In my comment I stated that the school isn't strong academically and that I was scared for my future in high school. Unfortunately, I was right; high school is nothing compared to MSC. Manhattan School for Children didn't not give us the right learning skills to achieve good grades in high school. I'm currently struggling a lot in high school to keep up with the homework and projects due to the fact that MSC did not prepare me or the other 8th grade students for high school. MSC did not teach me the skills in order to correctly organize my time with the homework I am given and my social life. In MSC, people were not properly disciplined; if we hadn't done our homework our grades would not be affected. In high school, I now get 2 or more hours of homework a day which is a COMPLETE difference from MSC and a huge reality check. During the first few months of high school, teachers have given us review tests about material that we should have learned in middle school; everyone knew what was on the review test but I was completely new to everything and I felt very lost. 

In the middle of 8th grade more than 10 mac books were stolen from one of the 8th grade classrooms, this caused a lot of fright in the 8th and 7th grade atmosphere. We questioned the safety and security of MSC; we asked ourselves and our peers: ""What if our own belongings are in danger of being stolen as well?"". The decrease of computers also delayed our learning sessions, some people were not able to use the computers to do their work, while others were able to. MSC does not prepare it's students for high school and it is also an unsafe environment, I doubt any parent would want their children to be in a school that cannot keep their own property safe and be in a neighborhood that contains thieves; and no student would want to be at risk of falling behind in high school. MSC is a fairy tale compared to high school and I do not recommend this school to anyone.",23,0,0,2013-03-18T01:14:57,0.75,0.021,0.215,0.004,0.28300000000000003,0.027999999999999997,0.149,0.065,0.128,0.16,0.583,0.14

Our child is a 5th grader at a citywide G&T that falls in the category of BSI and District 30 (Q300).  Our child’s fourth grade report card was all 4s, state test scores were double 4s (ELA/Math) and perfect attendance. We put NEST+m first on the application list for middle school as it is geographically easier to get to for us, but our child is on the wait list behind more than 200 other applicants.  We are content staying at our current school as it goes to 8th grade, but what caught our eye is the selection criteria/ factors for selection to NEST+m middle school.  Specifically for students from BSI and District 30 (Q300) where the “Performance Indicators” is weighted at 20% whereas at other schools it is less or not a factor at all.  We asked our current elementary school and they had no idea what “Performance Indicators, as assessed by the elementary school” is, nor did they report anything other than: report card grades, attendance and state test scores for admissions.  

Does anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is?  And why are the Performance Indicators weighted the highest (20%) for BSI/ District 30 Q300?

Does anyone know the percentage of ""Performance Indicators"" for Anderson and TAG?  Is it 20% as well?

We realize that students from other districts/ schools may be less represented at NEST+m so can understand the need to give different weights and have different criteria to obtain diversity at NEST+m middle school.  At the same time, we feel that parents should be aware of the process/ criteria so they can make informed decisions.  We are simply looking for transparency.  Parents considering/ deciding on an elementary or middle school like BSI or Q300 (or other G&Ts) would probably like to know how their current decisions will affect their future options.

Ask the admissions people at your own school how many students leave after 5th grade? Zero to one probably.

We found it to be too much of a coincidence that they cited ""District 30 / BSI (20K686)""- District 30 is where Q300 resides- they are not even in the same borough.

My feelings about the place are very mixed and I'm not entirely sure that if I had it to do over again, I would send him there--which I did, for nine years, starting in kindergarten. The school works well for kids who are smart, good test takers and in one way or another, ""popular."" Kids who don't fit those categories are not necessarily helped and encouraged--their parents are reminded that their kid may not be Anderson material and the children may wind up feeling unwelcome and/or having to leave. Consider: at the school graduation ceremony this year, a few of the ""popular"" girls sang a suite of Barry Manilow songs because that happens to be the principal's favorite singer. Sitting in the audience, I was surrealistically reminded of how the school had never struck me as a real community. ""Popular girls"" and Barry Manilow? Give me (and my kid) a break. 
It is true--and I will give Anderson credit--that my kid got into his top choice high school and feels extremely well prepared for it. He had some very good teachers that he loved and he feels some nostalgia for the place. By the standards of the school, he did extremely well academically and was a ""success."" But go into this school knowing that it's sink or swim, every kid for him/herself, and survival of the fittest. Works for some kids--not always for mine. He had long periods of unhappiness there, though stuck it out of his own accord. Consider if your child seems to be smart, focused and socially adept. Otherwise, he/she may run into problems and there won't necessarily be a lot of sympathy. I am really relieved that he's now in what seems to be a very nice high school, where parents and children appear friendly.

I cannot describe how much I have to thank to this school and it's staff for giving me a chance to be myself and achieve academic success. I strongly recommend applying to this school, no matter what age, because there will always be both students and teachers to welcome you into this community environment. Never be scared that you won't make friends, because the people that go to Anderson are the smartest and nicest kids that you will ever meet.

03M415,Theresa L C Hammonds,manhattan,Middle,86,"I am a new parent to Wadleigh Secondary School for the Performing and Visual Arts, this is my first year. My daughter is in the 9th grade. Choosing our local high-school was a conscious decision for me. My daughter was initially not on board, particularly because she heard from several friends that Wadleigh was not a good school. So you can imagine my surprise when recently my daughter told me how much she ""loves"" Wadleigh. Her enthusiastic outburst in support of her new school came during a discussion we were having about her day. My daughter expressed joy in participating in the day to day activities of the school. She specifically said that the school did not feel so ""heavy handed"" (her words not mine) in their management of student issues. The schools uses a ""pedagogy of love"" as their management theory, and truly for my daughter she feels loved while in the building. My daughter is also part of the vocal group at Wadleigh, she consistently speaks positively about the vocal teacher and all that she is learning about music. In her first year, she has already auditioned and earned a part in the schools main performance. We could not imagine such an opportunity at larger performing arts high schools. 



While I am pleased that my daughter is enjoying this experience as a student, as an educator I am ever watchful of the quality of academic work she is receiving. It appears that thus far there has been a great bit of review of her eighth grade year. I am impressed however with the encouragement students receive to complete Regents requirements in the 9th and 10th grade, so that they can focus on taking AP courses in their 11th and 12th year. There is a great deal of discussion about college going and already parents have been invited to a college workshop so that we can began supporting our students with the college going process. This definitely has pleased the educator in me. 



I have not had great interaction with teachers, but from my frequent visits to the school it appears as if the teachers are dedicated to their craft and their students. I have been in meetings with the Principal and her desire for excellence in every aspect of the school is appreciated by parents like me who want a high-quality high school opportunity for their child. I appreciate the love and passion she appears to bring to the work. I like that she knows her students and appears to be engaged with them in ways that I have not previously seen. 



If you are a parent who is looking for a 9th grade experience for your child, and he or she is interested in a performing arts school, I truly hope that you will consider granting Wadleigh the opportunity to provide you with a tour. It is still quite early in our relationship, but so far I give the school two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",0,0,0,2019-11-01T01:35:11,1.0,0.047,0.267,0.012,0.9129999999999999,0.337,0.86,0.012,0.488,0.442,0.023,0.402

We had fabulous teachers when I attended it as I.S 88. The teachers then we're also members of the Harlem community, so they knew what the students were up against academically compared to the well funded schools in the nearby so called well off neighborhoods. The African American teachers at Wadleigh all worked together and focused on making sure the students learned and were prepared to move on to High School & College. Their main goal was to tell and teach us everything we needed to know in order to excel in the real world and poor grades and absenteeism were not acceptable. And this was back in the early 80's when Harlem was at her low point. So I'm surprised to hear this now when there seems to be much more money flowing through Harlem today.

We think it would be excellent for John's spirits if we could contact former students who would be willing to share with him how he has influenced your life. We will likely set up a meeting via skype for those outside of the New York City area where John now lives.  We would also like to reach out to you and offer you the opportunity to learn more about John's condition to see if you might be able to help him

03M415,passionate_betty,manhattan,Middle,86,"I am a volunteer at Wadleigh, working as a tutor and as a member of the School Leadership Team.  As a member of First Corinthian Baptist Church, located two blocks from Wadleigh, I became involved as a result of Pastor Michael A. Walrond, Jr.'s focus on the injustices, such as school closings, co-locations, and budget cuts, that are being visited upon district schools in our community. Separate and UNEQUAL schools are the result.  Although I continue to fight against these unfair policies, I and other members of our congregation and the community are working with Principal Chin and his staff (conditions are turning around) and the rest of my comments will be in that vein.  

I agree that the arts programs at Wadleigh are top notch.  I've met most if not all of the arts teachers and many of the students.  Both teachers and students are passionate about their work which is apparent when you talk with them and see their output.  However, there are other positive occurrences in the environment which you might miss if you are here for just a short period of time or don't talk with other students and teachers who are just as passionate about their work.

For example, one of the Global Studies/ History teachers coaches a Mock Trial team where students are taught court room practices and strategies by attorneys who volunteer to work in the program which meets on Saturdays.  Last year, the team beat one of the most prestigious private schools in this city.   Can a Thurgood Marshall or a Sonia Sotomayor come out of Wadleigh?  Of course one can if you have a passion for the possible and work from that perspective, something Pastor Mike presses upon our congregation, and something I see in many students and teachers I meet here. 

I'd like to say something about a couple of other comments that you made.  I am in the school often at different times of the day and see the movement of students through the corridors.  There is very little, if any, loitering in the halls or in the stairwells, something I did see before Mr. Chin's arrival.  Also,  classroom desks are not arranged haphazardly but in a way that encourages small group cooperation.  It's one of the new, modern techniques of classroom management.

Finally, technology is being implemented in many exciting ways.  Several new Smart Boards and other technological devices, hardware  and software, have been added and a coach is training the staff in their use.   Not only will this facilitate teaching but also communication between staff, students, and their parents.

Is there room for continued improvement?  Of course, and we continue to push for that.  But a lot of positive change has happened since Mr. Chin's arrival less than a year ago and Wadleigh is on an upward swing.       ",1,0,0,2013-01-22T23:02:00,1.0,0.047,0.267,0.012,0.9129999999999999,0.337,0.86,0.012,0.488,0.442,0.023,0.402
03M415,coach_crump,manhattan,Middle,86,"I have had it up to my eyeballs with the negativity about Wadleigh.  People come in and take a snap shots and form and assessment of Wadleigh in one day (maybe 3) and put something in print and parents and students who can benefit from being in a community based school are turned off without doing their OWN legwork.  Enough!  IT takes a real man or woman to dig in and get dirty and meet the challenge of working for a school where the political and socioeconomic odds are stacked against you.  There are people who do it every day and ignore the pressure of the interlopers and people who offer nothing except criticism from an external standpoint.

Joshua Johnson was on Ellen, and had the initiative to tap dance his way through college.  Good for him!  He played Wadleigh Basketball too! Tune into the the NCAA and see athletes Johnathan Coleman, wide receiver (2014) Boston College, Josh Watkins PAC 10 (2012) University of Utah, Karim Rowson, 2010 grad, University of South Dakota, (2014) William Harrison, Quinnipiac and University of Bridgeport (2012) Wadleigh Class of 2008, Trivonte Bloodman Mississippi State class 2015 (Wadleigh 2010) and there are many, many more.  Do you want to know about something positive?  I have many more success stories that played sports and made a college career out of it from Wadleigh.  My point is this is an economically deprived community with a parent base that needs to step up to the plate and meet the educators half way.  CAthy Black had the courage to speak on parents who have kids and leave them for strangers to raise.  The most profound thing she contributed doomed her.

Tyee Chin is a good man and has pointed the staff in the right direction.  While it is not easy and there are no excuses when you take the job as an educator, I want to see who is willing to help this population out and not who can point out hairy moles and imperfections.  Wadleigh can work and with the right support can continue to be a viable educational outlet for all communities. Anyone who is cowardly enough to throw Wadleigh under the bus, know the good things that are going on and the lowest common denominator of any sport is sitting on the sidelines waiting for action to take place.  I'm making the action happen and I have sent over 40 kids to college on full rides from Wadleigh as student athletes.  Check us on MTV 2, MSG VArsity, ESPN New York or just Google or Bing us...Wadleigh Tigers Basketball.

Below is an excerpt from the letter:

“Over the last few years, the District 3 community has worked tirelessly to address overcrowding in the district. We need our district school space to go to our district’s students.  We need to accommodate our growing population.  We need additional middle schools and high schools.  We cannot afford to lose any seats. 

The idea that the Upper West Success charter was approved without a site determined shows lack of planning and forethought. There was never room in District 3 for Upper West Success and we simply cannot accommodate this charter school. The District 3 Community Education Council, Community Board 7, Parent Associations from our District 3 schools, Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, Assembly member Danny O'Donnell, State Senator Tom Duane, State Senator Bill Perkins, Council member Gale Brewer, and Council member Melissa Mark-Viverito have all come together to express disagreement with this co-location.

Nevertheless, I was a very involved parent and I knew others who were as well so I don't agree that someone like that would never send their kid here.  In fact, involved parents are EXACTLY what a school like West Prep need.  From my perspective you have two choices if your child goes here.  You CAN get involved and support the good work of Principal Washington and the fine teachers so ALL students succeed, or you can leave it up to the DOE and hope for the best.  Personally I would opt for plan A.  I'm sure Mr. Washington would be open to having a conversation with you about the school if you made an appointment with him to discuss your concerns.",0,0,1,2019-04-26T14:02:56,0.75,0.098,0.33299999999999996,0.054000000000000006,0.858,0.235,0.779,0.005,0.52,0.441,0.025,0.304

03M421,Liz Wolfe,manhattan,Middle,204,"My son graduated from West Prep last spring.  I have recommended this school to many people because I loved it and my son thrived there.  

I disagree about comments that say they don't care about parent's concerns.  Every one of his teachers throughout the three years that my son was there responded to me whenever I reached out to them (which was a LOT).  My son got personal attention and his academic performance improved over the course of the three years.  Both his math and ELA scored increased.  I am one of Principal Washington's biggest fans and every one of his teachers was excellent.

I get frustrated when I read about parents who complain about West Prep.  I was on the PA Exec Board for all three years that I was there.  The parent involvement at the school is very low, and it was discouraging.  If a parent at the school is unhappy about what is occurring, SHOW UP to the PA meetings and the Principal's breakfasts!!  I went to every meeting and my concerns were always heard.  I also met personally with every teacher and both the AP and Principal all three years. Further, I saw that the school needed support with the students and I volunteered to help out.  I realize that not every parent has a schedule that allows them to go to meetings but surely more parents could have been there than were.  

West Prep's motto is ""With the Work of All"".  I know that once parents get to middle school they are burned out with volunteering.  However, I truly believe that my son's success at West Prep was due to the efforts of all involved - the school, my son, and me as a parent.",1,0,0,2014-09-09T14:05:07,0.75,0.098,0.33299999999999996,0.054000000000000006,0.858,0.235,0.779,0.005,0.52,0.441,0.025,0.304

If you were a student of his, I would like to reach out to you for 
participation in a ""This is Your Life"" styled project.  John had a 
stroke last year and is in his 70's. His mind is in great shape, but his
 body still faces challenges.  A group of us who admire John and his 
body of work have been making efforts to improve his condition.  We think it would be excellent for John's spirits if we could contact former students who would be willing to share with him how he has influenced your life. We will likely set up a meeting via skype for those outside of the New York City area where John now lives.  We would also like to reach out to you and offer you the opportunity to learn more about John's condition to see if you might be able to help him
 meet any needs he has that would help assist in his recovery.  If you 
were not a student, but know someone who was, please forward this to 
them. Thank you!

03M421,New Parent,manhattan,Middle,204,"Yes, many schools in NYC do not have air conditioning but have to keep school open nonetheless.  My daughter's elementary school has the same issue.

Yes, it is true that the only units available are ones that the DOE approves.  At my daughter's elementary school, we raised money specifically for air conditioners, but we could only use DOE approved units AND installers.

Unfortunately, the cost for air conditioners is often prohibitively high because not only do they have to get new AC units, but often the schools are not wired for electricity for AC, and that upgrade has to take place first.  Again, work must be done by DOE approved contractors. 

There is only a certain amount of money available for capital improvements each year.  With budget cuts, schools have to make hard choices about what to spend money on.

My own personal opinion is that school ends 3 weeks too late.  Not much learning happens in the last 2 weeks while teachers are cleaning up classrooms etc.  If it ended in early June, instead of late June, we would avoid the biggest chunk of hot days.

We love that it is a small and growing school.   Mr. Parker is a no nonsense very hands on principal who is super enthusiastic and clearly the leader in terms of the curriculum and the theory behind it, There is a significant expectation of parent involvement, but as a new school I'm not surprised and it's not uncomfortable.   
The specialists are great.  The gym teacher is a runner himself and all grades are part of Mighty Milers You can see their ""mileage"" online through a NYRR program...  He is also teaching them through many games good sportsmanship which is huge for young children who rarely like to lose!  She has gym 2x a week, music, art, movement, NDI comes once a week (same day as art) and Vital Theatre once a week (on one of the gym days).   
The kindergarten classes do a fall ""park study"" which rolls science, some math, reading, all together without them thinking about ""science class"" as something distinct which is neat.  On one of their park field trips they were super engaged --measuring trees, drawing/writing their observations of everything, etc., collecting things to study in the classroom. They came up with several questions about parks (as a class) when they started the ""study"" that they've been working on answering.  Of course there is uncertainty around test scores and all of those questions.  This is the first year there is a 3rd grade class.   No one seems to be stressed out about it.

Someone with dyslexia, for example,  might be a genius. Some say that Leonardo Da Vinci was dyslexic. Or for another example, Stephen Hawking has physical disabilities, but might clue your lovely child in about how the universe works. He was an average person in school, btw, an almost disaster until he applied for college. Then there's Einstein who was ""dull witted"" in school. In fact a lot of people that we know as geniuses were rather bad fits for school. John Lennon (genius musician), Thomas Jefferson didn't read until he was nine, Christy Brown could only move his left foot and became a famous author, Itzhak Perlman had polio and he's a brilliant musician. In fact, people with genius characteristics can often develop asymmetrically, or despite great physical odds, so that they're amazingly good at one thing, while being delayed in another area, relative to the ""normal"" population.

03M859,Numbertwopencil,manhattan,K-8,133,"The comments for SMSHS are fairly quiet but. . . they shouldn't be. SMSHS has, at least for this family, been an absolutely wonderful educational experience, one of the very best we've experienced in NYC public schools. The academic program is, in some ways, even better than the music program. Classes are small, teachers are smart and engaged, the curriculum (especially given the necessary Common Core and Regents elements) is better than any other HS we've experienced, the kids are focused, and the standards are very high. Take a look at the work by kids hanging up in the classrooms when you visit. You don't see fluent essays, long reports in Spanish, articulate fiction, and so on in your average HS; the work holds its own or exceeds academic work done in the traditional specialized NYC high schools. The kids are, without exception, accomplished musicians and most of them apply the learning skills they have developed through their music training to their academic work. As with music, kids are expected to practice until they show mastery of a academic subject and then they move on to the next topic. Kids who excel at, say, math or a language, speed through the required work and move on to the next level, they are not held back. Classes are small enough to make this work. And the music education is superb, the best in the city by our (no doubt biased) estimation . . . the school is essentially a small college-level conservatory. Most of the kids pass the AP music test in _9th_ grade and then move on to more complex music theory and practice. Many of the kids play at a near-professional level and they all take their music very seriously. Perhaps half the school day is spent on music and the classes _start_ at basically a college level and move on from there. The school is tiny and yet the orchestra (which is sometimes fleshed out by kids just starting a second or third instrument) performs at a respectable college level. Many of the kids are so self-motivated that parents and teachers sometimes, wisely, encourage them to do a little _less_ work every day, to take time off to be a kid, to socialize, and so on. It's a wonderfully supportive atmosphere, top to bottom, and while not every kid is going to go on to a career in music, every kid seems to find a comfortable musical niche at SMS.

There are, yes, the usual HS issues at SMS . . . kids will be kids, some are more mature than others, some, maybe most, are still finding their place in the world and sometimes being a kid is painful but . . . things that are problems at many high schools, social cliques, fighting, discipline, apathy, and so on are rare at SMS. Compared to, say, LaGuardia or Stuyvesant, SMS is a low-drama place. Complications at the school are more along the lines of kids working _too hard_, having too many outside music commitments, aesthetic disputes, or career concerns. However, it's a tight-knit group and kids and parents who have concerns will find thoughtful, sympathetic, help. Perhaps the largest issue at the school is the physical space, being underground is a drag (the whole school is in a basement with no windows). Also, the large school complex that houses the school serves several other schools and, sadly, kids/teachers/visitors have to go through metal detectors and security lines. 

If you are looking for a school for a kid who takes their music _and_ their academic work seriously, SMS HS is worth a close look. It's not for everyone, kids who don't already get up before school to practice (or read) might not get it. Kids who want a school with a diffuse arts program might want to go elsewhere. Kids looking for a big high school with traditional programs will not like it. However, for kids who think string quartet practice, followed by reading Harry Potter out loud in Spanish, followed by a critique of a duet written by a fellow student, then a private piano lesson, and then on to math class . . . is _fun_, then SMS is perfect.",2,0,0,2016-08-02T08:24:02,0.75,0.0,0.09,0.0,0.223,0.015,0.09,0.195,0.09,0.12,0.45899999999999996,0.038

03M859,Numbertwopencil,manhattan,K-8,133,"Congratulations! I don't think you'll be disappointed in the academics (or the music) at SMS. I just read through my comments above and a year later that all holds true, at least for us. SMS is not for every kid, not even for every music-focused kid, but for kids who take all of their studies seriously and want to work on music for half of their school day and be surrounded by musicians, it's heaven. I wish the school wasn't in a basement. I wish the music program was more willing to take chances and/or focus a bit more on music by living composers. (And sometimes I wish the kids had a larger role in presenting the school to outsiders because in my experience, the kids at SMS are very articulate about why they are happy there.) But, overall, it's a wonderful, caring school that respects its students and faculty and expects the best from both. If you visit, look around, ask plenty of questions, and you like what you hear and see, you can't go wrong. The school is, at least in my opinion, very honest in its presentation, if anything they undersell themselves a bit. 

Here's a remarkable profile of a current SMS student and celloist:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrGGzDXYTI

There are better and worse musicians and students at SMS high school but nearly all of the kids seem driven not only to become good musicians but to become thoughtful and engaged citizens. No kid at SMS is average but this profile is average for the school. The details of SMS HS aren't discussed in this video and it's more a portrait of a young celloist than a profile of the school but I'd say this makes as strong of a case for SMS HS as any of the official Kaufman Center videos. (I'm not 100% sure about this but I _think_ that video was made by one of the young man's fellow students. The filmmaker's bio says that he's a 17 year old HS student studying composition at a public HS in NYC . . . and I can only think of one school where that is possible.)",1,0,2,2017-03-09T18:54:31,0.75,0.0,0.09,0.0,0.223,0.015,0.09,0.195,0.09,0.12,0.45899999999999996,0.038

I can't speak to your particular audition, etc. but my son got in and we had zero influence with anyone, were not musicians, etc. He was just a potentially talented musician. He's now in college, studying music, playing piano, composing.

03M859,vimala,manhattan,K-8,133,"My child was admitted without my family knowing a single person at the school.

I agree that the school lacks transparency about the admissions testing. That is on purpose--if parents knew exactly what was on the test, they would engage in expensive test-prep to give their kids an advantage. NYC parents do this kind of thing all the time.

That said, if you want to give your pre-K child an advantage, enroll him or her in a Dalcroze class in the Lucy Moses School (same building as Special Music School). These are music and movement classes that I suspect are quite similar to the kinds of activities the kids do during their admissions tests. My child had Dalcroze classes and played an instrument for a year before the admissions test. It also doesn't hurt that my child grew up in a musical environment. My sister is a professional musician, and my spouse and I are serious amateur musicians.

A bigger problem, I think, is that the tests give older kids an advantage at the expense of the younger kids. There is a huge developmental difference between a child who has just turned 4 and one who is 4 3/4. I have noticed that almost all the children in my child's class have birthdays in January and February! This is not a coincidence (see Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers"" for a fuller explanation of this phenomenon). In my opinion, the school should stagger their testing so that all of the students are almost exactly the same age when they are tested for musical aptitude.",3,0,1,2016-03-04T14:07:47,0.75,0.0,0.09,0.0,0.223,0.015,0.09,0.195,0.09,0.12,0.45899999999999996,0.038

Below is an excerpt from the letter:

“Over the last few years, the District 3 community has worked tirelessly to address overcrowding in the district. We need our district school space to go to our district’s students.  We need to accommodate our growing population.  We need additional middle schools and high schools.  We cannot afford to lose any seats. 

The idea that the Upper West Success charter was approved without a site determined shows lack of planning and forethought. There was never room in District 3 for Upper West Success and we simply cannot accommodate this charter school. The District 3 Community Education Council, Community Board 7, Parent Associations from our District 3 schools, Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, Assembly member Danny O'Donnell, State Senator Tom Duane, State Senator Bill Perkins, Council member Gale Brewer, and Council member Melissa Mark-Viverito have all come together to express disagreement with this co-location.

03M862,S. Fofana,manhattan,Middle,428,"My daughter graduated from Mott Hall 2 this past June.  From 6th grade to 8th grade her time there was spent working hard, expanding her horizons, making new friends and having fun. I was amazed by their ability to take children of different races, ethnic backgrounds and academic levels and make this into one school family.  Parents and Staff work together for the betterment of all the children.  All the recent talk of integrating District 3 did not bother our school since Mott Hall 2 has been doing exactly what was proposed and doing it well from the schools inception.  I'm happy that they were given the opportunity to expand their space onto the 5th floor of the school. The additional space will help Mott Hall 2 to become even better.  I would advise all parents who children are currently in seventh grade to prepare them early for the high school process. Start looking at the NYC High School directory which can be found online, during the summer months and narrow down your child's choices. Go to each schools website and take note of all their instructions regarding admission. Many schools require that documents be dropped/mailed to them directly by the parents not the Guidance Counselor. If your child is interested in attending a Specialized H.S. get them tutoring the summer before they start 8th grade.  Keep track of deadlines, schedule tours and be realistic.  My daughter got into Beacon H.S.  Mott Hall's 2 Guidance Counselor is fantastic. My daughter's classmates got into various schools such as Beacon, Manhattan Hunter Science, Stuyvesant the list of fantastic schools is extensive.   A word of caution, only list high schools on the high school application that your child would be happy to go to no matter what.

My advice to parents going through the Middle School process. Check the NYS scores, Tour the school and keep in mind that while scores and accolades of a school is good. The bottom line is what is best for your child.

03M862,Happy Parent,manhattan,Middle,428,Mott Hall II is such a great school!! This is the first school I've seen where they not only concentrate on academics but they take a huge interest in the child as a whole. It's important to the teachers and Principle to have happy students. Being in middle school is one of the hardest things our children will go through and I am certain that at Mott Hall she will get through this process with all the support she needs.  Teachers are always available to help students after school and during lunch.  Mott Hall II is genuinely a great school. ,1,0,0,2013-10-07T14:32:54,1.0,0.037000000000000005,0.24100000000000002,0.03,0.62,0.154,0.479,0.027999999999999997,0.255,0.498,0.16399999999999998,0.11199999999999999
03M862,Parent,manhattan,Middle,428,"Mott Hall II has welcomed my 6th grade son with open arms.  Teachers are thoughtful and attentive.  They work collaboratively to offer scholars skill-focused, hands-on learning opportunities in every class.  For example, in Science, the 6th graders started off the year learning about the scientific method and then jumped right in to design their own straw rockets.  Last week, they launched them and now they are writing up their first labs.  In ELA, scholars examined pieces from a radio show, ""This I Believe,"" and then they wrote and recited their own pieces.  In Social Studies, students interviewed people about their decision to move and discussed the push and pull factors of migration.  They also mapped their city block and created their own countries after discussing borders, land forms, and climate.  My son is excited to go to school each day and raves about his teachers.

If you are looking for a smaller school where students are challenged but never lost, where all the teachers know everyone's names and respond quickly to email concerns, and where the students and parents are diverse and social, you should seriously consider this school. 
Granted, the physical plant is not great, but if your main concerns are  rigorous academics with clear standards for success, collaborative work, and a nurturing environment with an eclectic student body, then this is the place. 
The teachers are invested in the well-being of the entire community and participate in school fundraisers and fun events. The administration is approachable, inclusive and creative.

The after school options are expanding yearly, and this year they are free. Yes, free, with a suggested contribution to support the programs. They include sports (basketball), model UN, music lessons (brass and strings, I believe), science, and more.

I am a 8th grader as of this year and its been a amazing 3 years. I am a very arts influenced student, I have been in the school rock band since the first year I was at the school and I played the music for our production of West Side Story and this year I am in our production of The Last Unicorn and I feel like arts wise the school has so much to offer. The school also has an award wining chess team, a boys and a girls track team, a boys and a girls basketball team and a co-ed flag football team. The School offers a variety of after school and in school classes, such as, Model United Nations and my elective on music and how it effects history and economy and have no fear, we all get all of our core and extra-curricular classes into our schedule every day (this being math, science, social studies, ELA, Art, and Physical Education). The thing I love about Mott Hall 2 is from my first day at this school I felt safe and at home and that's one of the many things I have always loved about the school.

03M862,Aidan Huntley,manhattan,Middle,428,"I am an eight grader and I have been here at Mott Hall II since sixth grade. I can tell you that this school is great academically and they offer so many enrichment/ after school classes and clubs that I have a really hard time choosing between them all. I currently participate in Model UN which is one of the many clubs our school has to offer. Every year we have a big meeting in the UN headquarters with other kids from all around the world. Each deligate represents a country and we must write a position paper and debate with the other kids. I am also taking regence science (Biology) and regence math (Algebra 1). These are two classes that most students take in high school. This means when I get to high school I will be able to move on ahead to the next course. Not many schools offer regence classes in the eight grade and the teachers make sure you are ready and capable for the class before you take it. The teachers are very good at their jobs and have a lot of experience. The teachers here have taught me things that I would never believe possible to learn. My teachers see potential in every one of there students and they have pushed me to become a great student but also a great person. Over my last three years here, my teachers have helped me reach goals that I never thought were possible for me. The students here at Mott Hall II are as great as the teachers. I know pretty much every student in the school including sixth graders. In this school we are not students who happen to be in the same classroom, we are family that are working together to be the best people we can be. The students help me learn as much as the teachers do and we all get along. Our school also offers sports such as basketball, volleyball, and fencing. My school has really prepared me well for high school and I feel ready to tackle new and exciting goals that lie ahead.

The school has been the personification of what middle school education should reflect. The staff are so deeply involved in the well being of all the students, from teachers to administrators, the students are known and pushed ( with compassion!) and told over and over again that they CAN succeed. They are given incredible opportunities both academically and socially. My son has grown into such an amazing kid, and in no small part due to the care and education he's received at school. The guidance counselor works hard in the 7th and 8th grade helping kids with the High school application process. The school goes to bat for your kid in a myriad of ways and it's an amazing collaborative experience between staff and parents/guardians. My son ( who struggled academically before Mott Hall II) has been accepted to a really great high school! Rest assured that if you send your child to MHII, that they will bring out the very best in your child. 12-14 years of age is such a rough time, and they handle the kids just masterfully.

04M012,C.S.,manhattan,K-8,601,"As a person who works in education, I wish I could write a positive review of TAG but my child and many other students and parents, unfortunately, did not have a good experience at this school.  The previous bad reviews of TAG by students and parents are not surprising. 

After seeing all of the good teachers leaving and the bad ones staying it was time for my child to leave. Because of this teacher exodus TAG has become a mediocre school at best. The education is very meat and potatoes with no out of the box teaching or inspiring curriculum. This is due to the lack of leadership and the very amateur principal Cesar who sees the bright students as her personal meal ticket. The school only wants to teach the students about The State tests. If you want your child to just practice for tests and not interested in learning other things then this school is for you. 
 
TAG lacks any emotional support for their overstressed students.  Year after year the majority of students feel depressed and look for help but the school “therapists” are lacking the skills to do anything. It was always hard to see students lined up outside their office knowing the lack of support they would receive. The principal hides in her office and is extremely hard to get in contact with. To get a meeting with her is extremely hard and she never wants to be bothered by parents concerns. In all of my years in education visiting dozens of schools I have never seen a principal so inaccessible to parents, teachers and students. 
 
The lack of extracurricular activities is astounding for a gifted and talented school. Any local grade school has better facilities and activities. The building is old and full of asbestos with dirty water. I know the building has been close to shutting down because for years there has been talk of fixing these problems but the administration is not interested in doing so. TAG did not do well with the COVID 19 and received damaging assessments from the DOE about its lack of sanitary conditions. 

Because TAG has students that live far away from school there is no community or school spirit. The school PTA tries to raise money and give support to the administration but it's hard when 95% of students live far from the school. 
 
 Overall The school lacks leadership from principal Cesar down to the office personnel. There is no interest in inspiring students or creating a safe environment. All principal Cesar cares about is the NY State test scores, she could care less about an interesting education or the student's mental health. This school needs a major overhaul and it must start from the top.",0,0,0,2020-06-17T21:11:05,0.75,0.008,0.052000000000000005,0.0,0.381,0.025,0.231,0.413,0.161,0.151,0.17300000000000001,0.057999999999999996
04M012,Proud TAG community member,manhattan,K-8,601,"This is blatant slander. Principal Cesar literally attends WEEKEND (and some UNPAID) trainings in culturally responsive teaching as well as trauma informed teaching. She holds rigorous standards for her teachers and consistently supports them with resources dedicated at support student social emotional help. The problem arises when students are not transparent about issues they are having due to fear of retribution from their parents ( I have seen this happen, and students have mentioned it). So please, before you decide to slander a woman that has put her life on the line to make sure that your child's school has talented teachers and a supportive community. She also holds Coffee and Tee meetings EVERY month or even bi-weekly to connect with parents and address concerns. Yes, the extracurriculars may be lacking, but that's not HER fault when having to deal with shrinking budgets from the state because YOUR president decided that he doesn't care.

04M012,aperson,manhattan,K-8,601,"Let's just start this off with TAG, which is a good school for some kids. I have seen a lot of kids leave because they couldn’t handle the workload. However, when these kids did leave, they got into good new schools such as private schools and others. TAG is a school that is different and you haven’t seen anything like it yet. It is mostly preparing you for the state testing and ultimately when you are in 8th-grade, high school level regents. TAG is a school filled with work and little play. Kindergarteners have about 10-15 minutes to play outside, on good days. There is no longer playtime when you play with building blocks and nothing really to increase a child’s creativity at a young age. Just writing and reading stuff that maybe a 2nd grader will learn in other schools. People say that school is like a prison but for my many years being here, I feel like it really is. 

Who am I you might ask? I am currently a 9th-grade student and I just graduated from TAG. For parents that are trying to get their child into TAG, you should be prepared. Students are expected to do 100% and to the principal, she gets control anyway she can. She acts all nice to the parents, but if you hide a voice recorder in your child's bag, you will see her true colors around students. Even some of the teachers complained, 2 years ago like 10 teachers left TAG, it was that bad.

The uniform is crazy. At one point we were told it has to be 32 degrees or lower for us to wear boots otherwise we need to wear shoes. If you ask her now, she will deny it ever happening because of the parents and students complaining. You have no sense of the expression in this school, you need to always have a tie and you will get in trouble for not having the right shoes. I know kids whose parents don’t wanna buy them shoes cause they are too expensive so they cheaper shoes. Those kids worry if they are going to get detention because of that, and I feel like that's crazy. The gym uniform is expensive, I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying it from the TAG PTA. They sell it way too overpriced for a logo that is very small compared to the size of the shirt. Students who PAY for shirts from the Debate Team and Chess team are not allowed to wear it to the gym, which is absolutely crazy. Just get red sweatpants and a white shirt and you will be fine. To make stuff worse, the principal doesn't let you wear the TAG sweatshirt that you buy from the TAG, like what is the point.

We have two vice principals, and the one students feel more comfortable around is Ms. Cosme. She is very open and relaxes, and if you have been at the TAG for long enough she might have been your 1st-grade teacher! However Mr. Dascal ( we just call him Dascal) is the opposite, he’s always mad for some reason and is never in a good mood. If he is, it is a rare occasion. We call them the 3 Deadly J’s ( their first names are Jennifer, Janette, and Johnatan). Everyone but Ms. Cosme (Jennifer) makes the school feel like a prison, and students are tired of it. We are kids with feelings and we need a voice. It has been so bad that we need a Student Council to give ideas to the principal and even the election was disorganized. 

Now let's talk about academics and class sizes. The class sizes at this school are WAY too big. In Kindergarten and 1st grade it is around 20 kids per class with 20 classes. But as your child gets older, more children are joining the classes and at one point there were 35 kids in a single class. Kids leave for schools like Hunter 7th grade but having that many students at one time are harder for individual learning with the teacher. Teachers are really trying to make learning fun, but with 35 students it is very hard to keep everyone focused. I have been here for about 9 years now, I know. As of now, my class has 25 students and we are lucky. 

The teachers for the 8th grade are amazing, Mr. Goodin and Ms. Danticat has been here for a while and knows what they are doing. We have lost 15 good teachers, our Spanish teacher, our science teacher, and our history teacher to name a few. Our new history teacher is a teacher from the lower grades, our new Science teacher was a substitute at one point. And for about 2 weeks we have a sub in Spanish. For all of these classes, we are taking the regents and proficiency for Spanish. As a student, I am very worried. I feel like staffing should be better, but I am just a child. Teachers are really advocating for the students, more than the principal it feels like. 

Activities and programs for TAG are seriously lacking, the middle school programs are getting cut more and more and that is because not everyone can afford $1,250 per child to donate. The only club that middle school has is the YMCA ( not a part of TAG its YMCA program), Debate, Latin Jazz ( if you get in) and chess(which you pay the PTA for and the middle school sees none of the money back). Elementary students get way more stuff. The middle school has half-broken computers while they get BRAND NEW IMACS. Like how is this fair? Art class you cannot really express yourself, your art needs to be in a strict set of guidelines and you cannot do something related to the topic. The art teacher never finds the beauty in your artwork and always finds something wrong with it. Gym class is entertaining and Mr. Wong is really trying to stay with the guidelines and also make it fun. Mr. Faulkner is a really good music teacher and he makes class fun. 

After reading this about TAG you might wonder, why should I send my child to TAG? It all depends on how you think your child will perform if your child could keep up with the workload and will be fine with all the things I have said above, TAG is for you. TAG has been changing and this TAG in the point-of-view of a student that has been here for a while and has witnessed the good and the bad. If your child cannot do good with the reasons listed above you should research some other schools.  I know this is long, but I believe this could help a lot of parents. Thank you for reading this and I hope your child finds a school that is right for them.",0,0,0,2020-03-19T03:09:53,0.75,0.008,0.052000000000000005,0.0,0.381,0.025,0.231,0.413,0.161,0.151,0.17300000000000001,0.057999999999999996

My oldest (6th grade) has always thrived here academically and has always been on the honor roll, but has also always had trouble speaking up as she is very very shy.  Her teachers have, for the most part, been incredibly caring, understanding, and helpful with this.  Group projects in core disciplines as well as in technology (Lego Mindstorms + coding) have helped her become comfortable with working with others.  I credit TAG with preparing her enough to do well on the Hunter HS exam, particularly the essay - she got in with no additional prep.  My middle child started in K being behind his peers as he could not read and struggled to get started.  Now in 4th grade, he LOVES to read and has also consistently been on the honor roll.  He especially loves art - the art teacher exposes the children to the work of many different artists and gives them very creative projects to do.  My youngest (1st grade) is my most willful and free-spirited, so she has had the most difficult time settling down and focusing as her peers do.  TAG is a tightly-run ship with strict but effective discipline, so it has been harder on her than on my older ones.  Her teacher has been very encouraging about this.

I've also seen what some of the other people on here are talking about, regarding Ms. Cesar screaming at little children. I know a parent whose child had to be talked out from under a desk bc he was so frightened of her. She told the kindergarten class they weren't allowed to use the toilet after lunch (which was at 11:30am!) AT ALL, which violates health codes. Students fear her - and we're talking about good kids here, not delinquents who need keeping in line.

If you have a child with an IEP, you will be ignored. Totally. They do not care about kids with special needs. 

Basically, what happens in the classroom is excellent and your kids WILL learn a lot. They will excel and do well on the state tests.

The school really hasn't changed much except for the loss and addition of new teachers , students , and electives.  Class sizes are 30 or more and there isn't much teacher to student one on one time which tends to effect a students learning and they'll start to struggle. They teach advanced things like 8th 9th or 10th grade lessons in sixth grade and sometimes rushes through material to get it out of the way , which doesn't leave a lot of time for grasping the material. Some students tend to struggle but there isn't really time for going back and reviewing sometimes. Strict dress code , no real freedom of expression except if you earn a dress down day or its your birthday. The principal is sometimes very harsh , she'll yell at kindergarteners which scares me and I feel really sorry for the little kids. The school barely has any money for extra or outside of school activities. Most of their money comes from fundraising which many of the kids don't really participate in , especially the middle school. Most of the money the school generally has mostly goes towards things like Rally and other educational things. There aren't really any sports programs either only basketball for boys and volly ball for girls only in the 7th and 8th grades. Also there isn't any extra educational programs for those who need it.

04M012,HarlemNYgma,manhattan,K-8,601,"my granddaughter did not have a great experience at TAG. The problem I see is that those who have had a negative experience at TAG do not speak about the realities of their child being targeted, neglected, singled out and blasted if they do not function at a high standard.  If your child is a little behind, they are not given the extra help that is needed.  What I really did not appreciate and will vocalize it is that parents have to sign an agreement to remove their child from the school if they do not hold up to the standards of TAG's academics.  If a child has a disability, it is also shunned upon.  If parents do not have the time to participate in the school, their child is neglected and targeted to be removed from the school.  I questioned why, with a school so diverse, starting out as a predominately Black school, that they would not offer more support for students who do qualify for placement in TAG or any citywide school?  Anderson, NEST+M, BSI all offer great support for their students and do not push them out of the school if they have a bad year; they offer them the support they need!  If I am wrong, the please correct me but, from what I hear, no citywide g&t school except for TAG gives up on the students who are accepted in their school and tosses them away as lost causes.

Her teacher made her feel horrible every day.  Let everyone in the class know that she was struggling and made her feel very bad about it. My granddaughter went from a very bright and energetic child, full of query, astute, quick to pick up and learn ANYTHING, very confident and well behaved, to a distraught, confident-broken seven year old who would rather have stayed at home than go to school, her behavior and mouth reflected this.  In the beginning of the school year the teacher told her mother that she would not pass but never offered any assistance ""I don't have time to help her... move her to another school.""  From the second week in September she was neglected academically.  At times she came home in tears because the teacher embarrassed her, screamed and yelled at her.  We witnessed this abuse several times.  Ms. Cesar was not very accommodating, was untouchable and unreachable.  the request to change my granddaughter's teacher fell on deaf ears, like dust being dropped in a turbulent sea.

Don't get me wrong, TAG is a great school if you're willing to be at the school often, and not afraid to lose time at work.  My daughter is a single mother and MUST work and cannot miss time at work.  when she gets off of work, she has to pick up her daughter and get back home to Brooklyn, eat, bathe and sleep to get up at 5:00 am to get her daughter to school early and to work by 8:00 in the morning.  Don't expect to get any resources if your child is having a bad month or year, the solution is to remind parents about the agreement that MUST be signed in order to attend TAG, to voluntarily remove your child from the school, if the child cannot keep up.  Even-though my granddaughter caught up and reached the mark to be promoted, Ms Cesar decided that she would be left back or ""leave the school"" and she will not stop the REGULAR school from placing her in the 2nd grade.  She insulted my daughter stating that my granddaughter was not gifted and her test score of 99.99 was a fluke.  Even when other evaluations such as Stanford Bine showed her scores in the top 1%.  her tutors who helps students in wealthy schools such as Dalton, evaluated her, tutors her and says, that she is performing at the level she needs to be and at the level of those $34,000 plus schools. as a first grader, she went from performing just above a kindergarten level to a third grade level in less than five months!  when shown these evaluation (no less than 3 in the academic year) Ms. Cesar is not impressed.  my granddaughter is broken and clams up whenever Ms. Cesar is around and when her teacher, Ms, Liu tests her.  

For those of you who are considering sending your child(ren) to TAG Young Scholars, be prepared to make sure your child has EVERY skill they need to keep up and not have a bad week, month or few months.  Be prepared to spend time and money in and with (for) the school.  You HAVE to be a dedicated parent and get to know EVERYONE in the school in order for your child to be given preferential treatment.  

I am not sure what my daughter will do for next year.  We are already looking and applying for a transfer to another citywide G&T school.  I don't think it is fair and right to force my granddaughter to stay in an environment where she feels unsafe, unwelcome and literally castrated and ostracized.

But you should first try to arrange for a 6:30 or 7:00am sit-down meeting appointment with the principal and the teacher, before the daily demands of school. It's not too late.

There are not enough G&T spaces in New York City, so your granddaughter may have to stay where she is. She is a bright child and you and your daughter as tax payers deserve to see the girl treated as fairly as any other student.

Your daughter has proven that she belongs there academically. If she ever falls behind, get her outside tutoring. There are pockets of busy and low-income families who find a way to do this, paying for tutors. You will find a way. Make sure she keeps up her grades so that the principal has no logical excuse to have your granddaughter transferred.

It's not too late to continue to express your concerns with how your granddaughter was treated this year. It will make them more aware and accountable for the next children coming in.

How much (if any) ""free play"" is there in the classroom for kindergartners? And are there indeed any materials/tools such as blocks? Also: Is this slideshow - and the info in it - simply out of date? I see that the Insideschools Review is dated 2013 - how much of the description it contains is out of date now? We would really appreciate any comments on this, as we are about to apply to TAG for our daughter who is entering K in the fall.

04M012,Parent,manhattan,K-8,601,"Unfortunately, New York City does indeed continue to be a ""Tale of Two Cities"" when children, like yours, who clearly qualify for some ""higher level"" of specialized academic education are given so very few worthy and accessible options, especially at the middle school level.

Back when ""Middle School Choice"" was first introduced  five years ago my daughter also tested 97% through nationally standardized T.A.G. testing, qualifying her for ""Citywide"" school enrollment. We visited one official Citywide middle school downtown (among the few that existed then;  three total), but even then the seats were so limited that the school would only consider children who had tested in the 99th percentile. But guess what? Even THAT was NO GUARANTEE of acceptance!!! So imagine your child scoring in the 99th percentile and STILL not being selected!!! ""So how would they decide?"", we all asked. Hmmm . . . no one ever figured that one out.

In the meantime, it got a little scary for us parents when in this very same preliminary visit the Parent's Association President spoke and announced to all of us that even if our child eventually turns out to be one of the lucky few, parents of those children should know ahead-of-time they would be strongly encouraged to each make a minimal and significant annual financial contribution to the PA. I can't remember if she called it ""dues"" or what, but the minimum was somewhere around $500 per child. Yes, we're still talking about MIDDLE SCHOOL and yes, I said ""the minimum.""

The real truth is, while those kids that do get into the few middle school Citywide programs like this are fortunate, that even a school like N.E.S.T. that has its own high school nevertheless have a very large percentage of their kids apply to the ""Specialized High Schools"". Think about it; why is that?

And if THAT's the goal anyway (and IT IS) I wish I had known that back when I was also worrying about applying for my children for these (forgive me, but it's true) so-called specialized middle schools (not at all ""specialized"" in the same sense as the ""Specialized High Schools"" are) I would not have even bothered visiting, much less had my children apply! 

So in the end all that really matters for children of middle school age is to be dedicated, hardworking students, REGARDLESS of the school they are in. And then WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS PREPARE WELL FOR THE SHSATs. 

In other words, with respect to present ""opportunities"" and getting into a ""specialized"" middle school, they are far from a guarantee or a prediction of your child's future opportunities or success when it is truly going to matter most. And if it also helps to know, there are many, MANY parents like you in the exact same situation. I was one of them, and I will tell you that even over all these years, while the New York City's school system opportunities have improved, they have not improved anywhere near enough. THE GOOD NEWS is that it has not stopped either me or my kids, and it doesn't have to stop you.

 If your child does not gain acceptance here I truly hope you will not be too discouraged (feeling frustrated is NORMAL; welcome to the club!).

The PTA is very involved and supplement a variety of enrichment programs as well as fund assistant teachers for the lower grades.  In all the years that I have been a TAG parent I have never heard the PTA put a quota on fundraising.  In fact if you can't contribute financially they've always encouraged donating time.  We have many parents that get involved to make sure our kids have what they need.  Fundraisers are year round.  The subcommittees of the PTA ensure that there's always opportunities for us to participate in making the school a better place and for for our kids to bond.  The only downside is the admission's process, which the school has no control of.  (That actually is the responsibility of DOE.)

What I did say is that my daughter took the nationally standardized T.A.G. testing.

Additionally, my comment here was meant as a response to ""LoveSAUW"" below: ""Is it true that the school only takes 99 percentile kids . . . This sounds very discouraging even to go to the tour."" If you look there you will find I did eventually get it posted in the correct place, and maybe in that context my statement will make more sense to you.

But since you mention it . . .

For some reason it is not until the very end of your comment that you acknowledge, ""The only downside is the admission's process . ."" THAT actually is THE WHOLE POINT and it should not have been preempted by any focus, much less a prolonged discussion of, the so-called ""problems"" that occur as a result of being one of the very few LUCKY ones to be selected; MAY WE ALL BE CURSED WITH PROBLEMS LIKE THAT!!!

The real discussion should have been, what message does it send to ALL those children EQUALLY QUALIFIED but not selected? And does anyone even think about where those very deserving children end up attending as a result??? (yes, I said, ""END UP"") And can WE as parents, in good conscience, stand idly by and be satisfied to simply blame the school system?

What am I suggesting? Activism? No, though that might be appropriate. Town Halls and marching? No, though that might be appropriate too.  How about an honest representation and discussion of the facts? And let's keep the MAIN thing the main thing, not getting distracted (or distracting others) with the supposed ""problems"" of what happens AFTER our child becomes one of the handful to be selected. 

My kids are doing great, (really), a year ahead in their studies, in great programs with many, many other overachievers, and very active in highly competitive, selective, and prestigious extracurriculars. But dare I say in any way, shape, or form, that my responsibility to the not-so-lucky ends there because ""my kids got theirs, so . . . I'm good.""

Standards are very high at TAG, and it is a wonderful place for my child to learn. The teachers are absolute gems- they are creative with the curriculum and dedicated to their students and their craft. It seems like the teachers are also very well supported by the administration. My child loves her school and she loves her classmates, but the reality is that TAG has a way to go in terms of offering students a well-rounded education. Kids lack access to physical activity (no school playground, no organized team sports) and arts programming- though the visual arts and middle school music programs are great. TAG could also do a lot more with the Technology program. Our family still feels we are part of a special community with a lot of diversity, and we have observed that, in general, the changes at TAG are headed in the right direction. From what we can see, the principal works hard to balance the testing constraints- imposed on all schools by the DOE- with a sincere desire and ability to build enrichment opportunities into the curriculum.",0,0,0,2014-04-09T04:13:20,0.75,0.008,0.052000000000000005,0.0,0.381,0.025,0.231,0.413,0.161,0.151,0.17300000000000001,0.057999999999999996

So far my son had Ms Margaret and now Ms Lisa and Ms Eileen. The teachers at River East are truly committed, caring, talented and enthusiastic. We feel honored to be able to have those teachers. Students are differentiated to appropriate groups to assist with individualized development of skill acquisition. Curriculum is semi-project based, rendering this school with a balanced approach to teaching that allows for traditional as well as hands on learning opportunities. In addition to basic subjects, school places a strong emphasis on science, art, and dance. Students in 2nd grade also begin violin training as well as once a week swimming classes at Asphalt Green. Student participate in numerous trips around the city as the teachers are able to implement the curriculum while utilizing the wonderful resources NYC has to offer us all. My son also started attending a free after school program called the Phil Ramone Orchestra and was able to choose an instrument of his choice to begin perfecting.

  River East is a
  hidden gem in East Harlem. The academics are right on par with the charter
  schools but without the strict environment. Kids are able to be creative in
  an nurturing atmosphere. They are offered a variety of activities that are
  not seen in most public schools like tennis and swimming. Parents at this
  school are very active in their child's education and want nothing more than
  the best. My choice in choosing River East has not been an disappointment.

      As an educator at PS 38, I have dedicated my
career to the growth and development of all children I service.  As I teach, my method is to engage the
students into their own learning.  I want
them to desire knowledge as I encourage them to reach for the stars and dream
big.  Parental involvement in the
education of their children is a huge priority.  Children come first at P.S. 38.  
     Since I have
taught within the DOE, all children I’ve serviced have excelled!!  I am very proud to say that and I truly am
humble!  It is never an easy road as I am
stern, yet approachable with and open heart and a loving touch.  I say this because our jobs are not

their time, soul and money to make sure that we service the students to the

solution that only requires parental support, and you don't get it.  Then you have lost a soul that could have
been greater and better.  Don't get me
wrong, 97% of the time the parents are our rock...It's just that 3%.  If a child has struggled under my watch it
was because the parent was not invested in the solution (SC).  I only encountered that 1 time in my career,
and that was unfortunate.  However, I
still made sure the child excelled.

It's our community school and the leadership at the school has demonstrated vast improvement when compared to years ago when it was under review by the state  it is great to know that for the last 10 years, there has been continuity in the leadership demonstrating stability.  There are great things going on at this school. There are talent shows, assemblies, multicultural celebrations etc where the community is welcomed to attend. Most of all, my kid knows that the principal and asst principal care about them. Almost every time I visit the school, kids are anxious to get off the line just to hug her. She is never unapproachable with the children. I think that is important. Sometimes parents can be somewhat disrespectful to school leaders and teaching staff. I would probably be unapproachable also if your demeanor was less than acceptable.

      As an educator at PS 38, I have dedicated my
career to the growth and development of all children I service.  As I teach, my method is to engage the
students into their own learning.  I want
them to desire knowledge as I encourage them to reach for the stars and dream
big.  Parental involvement in the
education of their children is a huge priority.   


 


     Since I have
taught within the DOE, all children I’ve serviced have excelled!!  I am very proud to say that and I truly am
humble!  It is never an easy road as I am
stern, yet approachable with and open heart and a loving touch.  I say this because our jobs are not
easy.  Every teacher gives up a lot of
their time, soul and money to make sure that we service the students to the
best of our ability.  We wear so many
different hats as we deal with the different social problems the children
endure.  Often times we are met with
defiance from students and we have to figure out a way to deal with it and

My middle school years are completely erased from my memory from how awful this school was. I was here during the transition of Soto to Hasty’s leadership here and while I liked both principals...the overall atmosphere not so much. In fourth grade a teacher didn’t let me go on a school trip, all because my mom was out of the country and couldn’t help me with one assignment. In fifth grade a teacher wouldn’t allow me to use the bathroom during an exam unless I finished it in entirety first. Because all pre teens have perfect bladders right? Even in picture day one year, a teacher got mad I showed up in nice clothing that wasn’t uniform at all, and made me look ridiculously chunky with a burgundy knit cardigan that was two sizes too big on me and draped over to look like a dress; otherwise I wouldn’t be able to participate despite already having paid for pictures in advance. In one of my MS years I was jumped, by a few of my classmates—where two of them grabbed my hoodie and spit down the back of my neck. This happened in front of the school, and right back where the courtyard meets the little alley, right after school on a Friday. I ran in tears to find the AP—and you know what he said to me? “Come back to me on Monday and I’ll see.” To this day I have a box cutter knife scar on my cheek and C-PTSD from that day. It’s small factors from my time here that led me to being diagnosed with two eating disorders, two anxiety disorders, and bipolar depression.

04M057,Felicia Ann Jones,manhattan,K-8,762,"I have 2 boys in the school now. I am not at all pleased with the school. Since Mr. Soto stepped down the school has not been adjusting it has been declining. The scores are indicative of this. What's worse is that teachers and parents both feel that the job done is adequate. 32% receive 3 or 4 which leaves a whopping 68% undocumented. Why can't we see these scores? What did the children receive? By the way 32% of a typical 5th grade classroom is 8 students! Are we really doing that great a job?! The citywide average is laughable. Be mediocre. Get ahead. Not exactly the slogan I remember. Finally 98% for 3 or 4's on the science exam... I don't know what to say. I would hope that this is a true depiction. A correctly proctored test would ensure that the students do indeed possess the science expertise that this stat displays. I have heard stories of teachers giving answers from my brother who has been in the school for over 5 years. He likes his school, was prepped and accepted to a great school. Well not really. My brother constantly missed homework but performed well on tests. The school system is hypocritical; learn as much as you can but the wormhole doesn't call for complete cooperation... As long as you pass. I just wish public schools were more for the people than bureaucracy. I have had so many issues with this school. Academics is the only one that matters now. This school is not what you want if you want your child to keep a strict focus on absorbing knowledge. They do not push the envelope enough. Teachers need to understand that in this day and age, working for the BOE and working for the students can be intricately separate. I will post more after I ask more questions. It's important that we know. ",0,0,0,2014-10-03T11:39:34,0.5,0.11900000000000001,0.29100000000000004,0.081,0.94,0.324,0.848,0.043,0.256,0.6709999999999999,0.016,0.359

They had 4 children left back because they didn't learn anything that year, and kindergarten is a very important year for children. I brought this to the attention of the principal and she didn't respond in a positive manner. They had all sorts of different teachers in that class, they even had the school mascot substituting in tht class. Now when my niece had trouble with her reading they gave us a hard time to get her into a program that will get her back on track. They promised to give her reading recovery program to help her and every time I would ask her if they picked her up she told me no. So when I approached them to find out why Mr. Acosta said I'm not saying that your niece lied but you know kids don't always tell the truth. He basically called her a lier. This school is horrible at helping kids who are at risk because of the fault of the school.

I think Ms. Castillo, however, needs to be more supportive of ALL parents no matter what their ethnic backgrounds are. Regardless of financial contributions and involvement of parents, the principal owes each parent fair amounts of attention, understanding, and support to the best of her professional ability. There should be no elite parents! 

Mr. Gandia also could use some improvements in helping to  harmonize the relationship between his boss and the left-behind parents.

04M102,bellows123,manhattan,Elementary,240,"I am a parent of a kindergarten student in the G&T program, and I chose the school in part because of the many posts on this page. We have great respect for the administration (Principal Mullan and Asst. Principal Doerr in particular), and have found them to be extremely responsive. However, we have had issues with the program itself. First of all, laptops, ipads, and the smart board are heavily relied on class. We have raised this with the kindergarten teacher, and he feels that it is an appropriate use of technology. However, we feel that it is an excessive amount of screentime, and an over reliance on gadgets to do the job of teaching. Lessons are often introduced by Brain Pop via the smart board, and children work with the iPad or laptop at center time. I realize that this is truly a matter of opinion, but for us, it's a big problem. 

Second, despite the small class size, which we were hoping would be an advantage, there is little differentiated instruction or innovative curriculum. Homework comes back stamped with no comments, reading levels are only reviewed on a set schedule, and while we were told that differentiated math would start in March, it did not. They were supposed to implement the Great Books program which they have in place at TAG, but that did not take place. 

Third, there is little enrichment or project based learning, which are supposed to be the hallmarks of a district G&T. Chess and computer coding were introduced a couple of times at the beginning of the year, but were never followed up on. The first real project is the neighborhood unit, which is what we saw on our tour last year, and is indeed great. But that's the first project, and the year is almost over. There are art and science extras, but science is weak (kids frequently bring home coloring book pages), although the school is working on it and they supplement the science curriculum in class (they learned about the three stages of matter). Finally, it seems that there's a lot of non-educational downtime; the kids have watched movies in whole or in part during the school day (Finding Nemo, Trolls, Frozen, several Peanuts specials etc.), and while they have school trips,and some are to museums (The Whitney, NY historical society for the Mo Willems show) many of them are non-academic (a Halloween Puppet show, kids also saw stage performances of both the Wiz and the Wizard of Oz).

I went to part of the G&T open house, and then we sat in on an hour or so of the K G&T class. Julie Mullan, the principal, professed a commitment to constructivist, child-centered education for all kids and they seem to be really succeeding in putting this into practice for the G&T kids. They do project-based and in-depth learning, use a different, more hands on and project-based math curriculum, etc. When we sat in on Mr. Devine's K G&T class (he came from Anderson, where he was an assistant teacher for 5 years) the kids were working independently in small groups to make elaborate model neighborhoods from cardboard boxes, after having made maps of their own neighborhoods on paper. The maps and all of the work on display in the class was impressive - full sentences, all kinds of genres. He said many are reading several grades levels above their age.

And the teacher did all the street signs himself, instead of engaging the kids in so doing. Also, the map making assignment referenced in the above comment was done at home with parents over spring break. They do take several field trips, but many are just for fun. 

In terms of the kids reading above grade level, many of the children are indeed reading significantly above grade level, but are generally assigned in-class reading levels below their current level, and are not actively encouraged by the teacher to take home more challenging reading from the library, or explore new topics. While we received one comment on a progress report, urging us to encourage more non-fiction reading (and I agree with that need), she has never brought one non-fiction book home from school, or mentioned that she's been exposed to one during classtime--this is emblematic of the teacher's general lack of meaningful engagement with the kids.",0,0,1,2017-05-18T17:49:05,0.5,0.113,0.304,0.11699999999999999,0.8370000000000001,0.213,0.746,0.1,0.313,0.475,0.057999999999999996,0.409

My son, a special ed student, was subject to constant harassment and bullying.  Although he was always at the top of his class, over the last 3 years, he has declined on all areas.  They are ill-equipped to handle the broad-mix of special education students.  Students are not well-supervised at this school (most incidents happen during lunchtime or in the cafeteria).  They are also not very sympathetic, knowledgeable, or take the time to educate themselves about specific conditions of a child.  The moment you disagree with their recommendations, they tend to snub you out.  Administration tends to ""ignore"" meeting requests.  Guidance counselors are quick to call ACS with false allegations, subjecting parents to scrutiny and a tarnished record (even if it is unfounded, it will always be there).

The entire community is fortunate to have this amazing school and all is stands for. Mr. Pantelidis the schools principal is the perfect leader. He is beyond professional, compassionate about everything he does, he is always found in the building making sure all is running well, he makes sure all students prosper and get the help they need, if a parent has a concern of any kind Mr. Pantelidis makes sure in every way possible to have a solution that works and it would take him a short time to do so, he handles matters immediately, he is approachable always and always very kind, no one else can ever fit his shoes !!!

Second,every single teacher and all student support staff are truly amazing, always caring and understanding. These teachers work super hard and always make sure their students push themselves to do better and better and the students are not just students their family to them.

Third but not last, the office staff ladies are beyond professional, kind, loving and caring to any one who walks into that office, as the day begins at 7:30 am you will find these ladies assisting everywhere as families walk in, they assist the children during breakfast, and throughout the entire day and are capable to manage their office duties as well and have it all running smooth, no other school office can do this !!!

Fourth, the parent coordinator, Ms. Diane Spears is truly an amazing woman, with her duty as parent coordinator she goes beyond just like the office staff to assist families with any question or concern and she does it proudly and it shows !!!

Last, the school has the best PTA staff who have brought in new ideas and work countless hours to make things happen and its all for the kids !!!

We are proud parents of such a magnificent school !!!

04M171,Lillian Asencio,manhattan,K-8,705,"As a student being in this school from kindergarten to eighth grade it was a delightful adventure. Patrick Henry made me felt safe and I enjoyed that feeling. This school was like a second home to me and I am grateful to all the teachers and staff that have stood by me throughout my journey. Teachers were able to make class interesting, they even included valuable life lessons as well. Like always being aware of a situation, being focused, and most of all showing what's useful and what is needed in the future. 
  Now not only does this school makes me feel welcomed everyday, I feel as though teachers are actually interested into what I have to say. If it wasn't for the music teacher (the wonderful Mr. Durant) I wouldn't be attending my dream high school, I wouldn't have fully discovered my interest in music and love towards it. Along with my technology teacher (the magnificent Mr. Martino), he taught me an instrument that I never thought i would ever be able to play, he was always understanding and supportive that I'm so grateful to him as well. I grew a great bond with the teachers and I know future students will grow the same exact bond. It hurts to leave, but it feels nice knowing that not only my family support me, but that these teachers and staff support me as well. 
  I really recommend this school, the amount of supplies given to students, ipads, books, computers, and etc. The technology made learning easier and more interesting. Also, the staff are really understanding and sweet, and they do their best as well as Mr. Pantelidis. This school gives many opportunities, and memories to cherish.

Even though I had only gone to Patrick Henry for my middle school years, I was bale to make great friendships with my fellow students and I was able to bond with the teachers. The school may not be the biggest or most grand but there is definitely a lot of opportunities from this school.
     Patrick Henry is a great school that manages to help it's students learn important information and teaches us valuable life lessons, like how to work with others and how to look for opportunities. Throughout my years there, I have taken part in many out of school opportunities such as taking short classes at the Mount Sinai Medical School as well as being able to take part in the SIG program (Summer Institute for the Gifted) which allows students to spend time on actual college campuses. In addition the school has a been able to create a safe community between the teachers and students which I appreciated greatly. One of the teachers who I appreciated the most was the music teacher,  Mr. Durant. He showed me that I am able to do anything that I put my mind to and boosted my confidence in my musical abilities.
     Honestly, everything about this school was great in my opinion but there was one limitation, the size. My class alone has 35 students and we somehow managed to fit into our classrooms. Even so, with the amazing principle and Vice principles, Patrick Henry is constantly getting better and growing in technology. During my 8th grade year, student were given tablets to work on during class which is something I doubt I would have gotten at another school.

Music class was amazing, fun and even thou we had good and bad and even awkward moments sometimes, it was still one of the best classes I've had in a long time. I feel that i have grown academically and as a person,just like anyone else. and because of patrick henry, i am the student i am today,a student who wants and hopes to strive for success and a  great future.

Honestly everything i have to say about this school is positive, this school has taught me everything i know , but hasn't shown any bad decisions and influences. whats wonderful about this school, is that the teachers understand you, they help you in any way they can, and the best part is, that there way of teaching, involves fun, learning and communication.

Lastly, patrick henry has a lot of very good and wonderful teachers, but i may say that Mr.Durant was the best out of all of them. he Ramirez give up on me at all, and most importantly he gave me a many great memories to remember. he helped get out of my shy bubble. he knew that i was a shy girl that would barely talk to people, but look at it now, i could sing with my friends and even sing in public, but if it weren't for my music teacher, i would still be in my shy bubble and i would have a harder time in high school honesty.

The technology that we were able to use was great, and I know I wouldn't find that at other schools. The music program, led by Mr. Durant, was fantastic, and I have nothing negative to say about that. I grew not only as a student, but as a person. I became more confident in who I am and I can say that the strong academic program made all the graduating students capable of having a successful future. 

I don't have much to say about this school that is negative, and I know that I have been well prepared for whatever high school has to throw at me. The thing I love about the teachers is that not only do they provide a great learning experience in their subject, but they also take time to talk about the future and what kinds of things to expect. The teachers were down to Earth and sometimes talked about their own experiences in life prior to becoming teachers at 171. It was quite interesting to see their perspectives on everything. It was such a diverse group of teachers, too, so you'd always get a different story from a different person. 

I'd have to say my favorite memories will be my time in music class with Mr. Durant. I feel like I had a close teacher to student relationship with him most out of all the teachers I had during my time at 171. He especially helped me grow and come out of my shell to become not only a stronger vocalist, but a stronger human being. And for that I will be eternally grateful.

The children who go to this school are provided with so many resources due to the many grants and partnerships that Mr. Pantelidis (the principal) and his team are able to acquire for the school. This allows many inner city children, who might otherwise not be able to afford such programs, to be exposed to and avail of the various opportunities that they deserve. The school also ascertains that the children receive an excellent academic education, and their consistent above average test scores prove that. The teachers are enthusiastic and very caring, and many have been there for a long time, and seem to take real pride in their work and the children they teach. I also found Mr. Pantelidis to be very open to suggestions/concerns I had which I very much appreciated as it made me feel like the teachers and the parents could work together well as a team to ensure the very best for the children.

Patrick Henry Prep also has a wonderful music program and teacher in Mr. Durant, who goes above and beyond in his mission to teach children to love and practice music. His enthusiasm and approachable attitude was such a delight and inspiration to the kids. We also had the opportunity to be a part of their Opus 118 violin program, which my daughter greatly benefited from.

These were the three main criteria for school choice. PS / IS 171 did not disappoint. My daughter has been attending this school for seven plus years. I must say that it has been a great experience for her. She loves her school. This speaks volume. 

The academics are extremely rigorous and prepares students for high school and college. Technology is infused across the curriculum. The students have access to up to date and fully functional science and computer labs, laptop carts and there is a smart board in every class. There is a multitude of online resources for both parents and students.

As a parent of an aspiring vocalist, it would be remiss of me not to mention 171's music program. I have observed the growth of the music program throughout the years. This growth is evident in my daughter. She has developed her musical talent under the leadership of Mr. Durant and has been given the opportunity to participate in programs such as Solo Ensemble, NYSSMA, MS Arts Audition Boot Camp and Carnegie Hall Count Me In Program. It should be noted that 171 alumni currently attend some of the best academically advanced and arts high school in New York City.

Personally, my daughter has benefitted from OPUS 118 (violin), Horticultural Society, Chess in Schools, America Scores (soccer and poetry), Urban Advantage (science), Studio in School (visual arts) and  Harlem RBI(softball / baseball). These partnerships have proven to be invaluable. 

We are almost at the end of our journey with 171. We will surely miss this great school.",0,0,0,2016-01-07T23:14:37,1.0,0.03,0.231,0.011000000000000001,0.784,0.128,0.617,0.079,0.27899999999999997,0.5770000000000001,0.037000000000000005,0.266
04M171,Linda Ayala,manhattan,K-8,705,"My name is  Linda Ayala. I am a parent of 4. 3 of my children have already graduated from PS 171 in East Harlem. The remaining ?is in the 7th grade now. Ever since Mr. Pantelidis has taken over the school as principal,  he just continues to get better. He and his staff do not stop. They continue to push for more funding and grants allowing all of the students more opportunity and a great education. They have up to date computer labs for all grades. The City testing rates are excellent. They do not leave any child behind. They have an excellent music teacher who helps the children not only during their time in 171 but continues through high school enrollments and encourages them to follow their dreams. He shows them many different aspects of the music program not just in a book but takes them to events so that they may have the chance to experience the music hands on. Mr Durante has played such an important role with my daughter continuing to pursue her music interest in singing. He helped get her ready for her high school audition in so many ways. When she was in the 7th grade he gave her information for a summer music program that only few kids were chosen for after auditions. He helped prepare her and she was accepted into this program 3 years in a row. This also helped prepare her for high school. Now in the 10th grade she knows things that other kids don't because he taught the children these things in elementary school giving them the  knowledge that they didn't even expect they would need to know later and how important it would be.",0,0,0,2016-01-02T23:16:32,1.0,0.03,0.231,0.011000000000000001,0.784,0.128,0.617,0.079,0.27899999999999997,0.5770000000000001,0.037000000000000005,0.266
04M171,Amy Duverge,manhattan,K-8,705,"I am a former 171 student and all I have to say is that it has been the greatest experience of my life. It has always been such a lovely environment to be in. The classes are tough, yes, but it is all to prepare you for what is coming in high school. What I enjoy most about 171 as a student who wants a career in music is that music classes are given one or two times a week depending on what grade your child might be. To further extend that, they also provide an awesome after school program called GOAL chorus that I attended in my two years of being in the school. If you are a parent or a student looking to enroll in a middle school, I 100% encourage you to go to 171 for an amazing future ahead of you. There is something for every student to enjoy.&nbsp; Every teacher cares about their students. The principal is always there for you when needed.

The school prioritizes the safety and education of the students and cares very much about what parents have to say. Because of this school, I am taking sophomore and junior classes even though I am a freshmen. However, this not the only amazing thing about the school.

04M171,:)),manhattan,K-8,705," I am a sophomore in highschool and out of all the years of school I've had so far, P.S 171 has given me the best. Mr. Pantelidis ensures that the education of students comes first. Teachers and staff make sure that there is a open and safe learning place for students. Teachers also make sure that students are given all of the tools necessary for continuing on into highschool. One thing that I admired most about Patrick Henry Prep was it's appreciation of the arts. The musical instructor, Mr. Durant, is just about as good as it gets. It wasn't until I met him that I pursued my aspirations of becoming a vocalist. Never, in a million years, would I have thought that I would be going to the #1 performing arts highschool in america. And that's all thanks to the musical instructions provided by him. 

 There is another part of 171 that I absolutely loved, and that was the afterschool program, GOAL. It opened so many windows of opportunity for me, providing homework help and a spot in a choir! Also, GOAL was the reason I went to Washington, D.C. , and Boston, Massachusetts . (Those trips were SUPER fun.)

 All in all, although my time at 171 is over, I go to visit sometimes and it still feels like home. I highly recommend this school. Its one of the best.

04M171,disqus_IO69l0be5Q,manhattan,K-8,705,"As a sophomore student in high school, I can honestly say 171 was a great experience for me, along with classmates whom I still am friends with today. There is an open space to which all students, no matter their background, language, or etc., are encouraged to participate in. A strong department is quickly improving--music. Mr. Durant specializes in vocal music and guides each grade to becoming better musicians, and better people, too. Though the school has always, from what I have known through grades K-8, focused on having a music class, Mr.Durant has really brought the school and its students out to earn a name for themselves outside of the vigorous core class. The music program is brought even further out with GOAL, a significant part of the school that happens after classes, where students can work with other grades and ages to create and experience music. Additionally, the education system is very intense, which drives students to do their best and exceed expectations in order to satisfy themselves with knowledge and success. Along with all of that, the teachers work collaboratively to cater to the students' needs and make sure that all requirements, held up by themselves and by their bosses, are met. The school has shaped me to be the person I am today, and continues to do so with its open doors and expanding connections.

Bullying , labeling and very little tolerance for a child who was suffering from Anxiety Disorder due to the problems he was batteling.  The principal Mr. Pantelidis is an excellent principal but he is also more interested in his status in the NYC DOE than in the emotional well being of students with special needs.  That is why you see that the statistics for Students With Special Needs and Ells are alarmingly low for a school that is smack in the middle of East his Harlem.  This is an excellent school if you want academic rigor and consistency for your child.  It is an excellent choice if your child scores 4's in ELA and Math.
Not recommended for students with special needs even if they are intelligent and good kids.  Not the best environment if you like to fight for your chid's rights and advocate for fair treatment.  Mr. Pantelidis has to remember that he runs a PUBLIC SCHOOL run by DOE and funded by tax dollars.  They are getting just as bad as the pompous Charter Schools in this city.  You have to look and service all children equally!  Can't sacrifice providing an equal education for all just so that his personal status will not be blemished.  Disappointed and sad.

People who truly know what my son has gone through have marveled at the fact that I hung on for so long.  I am pleased that your experience has been a positive one but readers and future parents have a right to all reviews good or bad.  On a personal note, I worked with Mr. Pantelidis when he was a teacher .  I know he is an excellent educator and administrator but not all that glitters is gold, not all parents have shared the same experience.  I am thankful for the strong academic foundation my son has received at 171 but cannot say that he has been nurtured and protected as your grandchild has been.  I know many parents and students fawn over him, I was one of them not so long ago, but my child has had some pretty damaging self image issues that were born, cultivated and used against him at 171,  So no I should not be ""ashamed of myself"".  On the contrary I am speaking out and using my name so that others who are ""objective and know how to respect other people's point of view"" can make an educated decision before enrolling their child or children at the Patrick Henry School.  Also be aware that some people do acts of ""kindness"" and do make sure it is publized do it  for personal gains.  Been a teacher and parent at CSD 4 for 26 years.  Know the real deal, my glasses are not rose colored.  Shame on you for chastising me for giving my point of view or is 171 paying for these reviews as well?

Talk to professionals who said my son was experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome last summer and well into this fall 2013.  Yes he will listen.  Yes he will give in but only when you go in there and use your rights and demand them as well.  Will miss a lot of wonderful teachers and Mr. Martinez a real human being and excellent guidance counselor at 171 but the sooner I get my child out of there , the sooner I start to rebuild my son's self esteem.

A cousin of mine who graduated two years ago told me that she was mean and was never able to at least say hi to the parents or to the kids on the first day of school. Who even hired this principle? She is not doing a good job. Many parents would tell me when I would pick up my cousin, that she is not well-prepared to even be in the school and is very rude. I just feel like she needs to be more professional at her job and stop being obnoxious to others, such as teachers. Many of my old teachers have left because of her, however they were such great teachers! She has made my childhood school in such a bad place and has made the school look bad. Principal, Andrea Hernandez, who was there for almost two decades was very sweet and appreciated by everybody. She would always go downstairs every morning to welcome and even say hi to the parents. She would also welcome the kids on their first day and everyday too from their lunch recess, dismissal etc... She welcomed everybody in such a lovely way, unlike Ms. Perez.

My son was promoted every year and Ms. Forbes has been respectful of my wishes throughout. Ms. Forbes and the teachers have been in a climate of fear during the Bloomberg Walcott years so they were not explicitly supportive, however, their behavior towards me and my son has been nothing but professional and respectful.. I am grateful for all the work that the teachers do and how they care for the kids.

04M206,Anonymous,manhattan,K-8,477,"P.S./M.S. 206 Isn't the best. But, it also isn't the worst. The teachers try to teach all the time. They also try to help the best that they can. Although, many students here aren't really cooperative or eager to learn. An amount of students are highly distracting during class which results in many other children not being able to fully focus on their class work or to learn. Most kids will violate school rules such as cussing, cell phone use, talking back to the teachers. It's not the teachers who are bad because they try. It is the students. They do not fully respect the adults as they should. When students are loud and rowdy they usually only calm down when a higher faculty member is in the classroom or if the teacher breaks to the point whereas they have to phone the office. Many students become stressed because of such distraction. There needs to be a way where the distractive kids will pipe down. Those individuals are being down the other children's futures. Perhaps all the kids who don't care much could be placed in a class together, those who want to learn will learn and those who don't care will have to live with the fact that they didn't take the oppurtunity to learn when they had it.",0,0,0,2014-05-07T01:00:34,0.75,0.149,0.442,0.059000000000000004,0.8740000000000001,0.174,0.7879999999999999,0.019,0.245,0.6729999999999999,0.042,0.302

The school wanted to eliminated all general education classrooms when they started this program- so naturally now they just neglect them. I am a former teacher and I know 4 other teachers who have all quit this school. Every year an average of 3 teachers quit. 

The children here are as wonderful as all children- but their emotional needs are neglected unless they are in the autistic population. Because the autistic group needs good role models all the problem children are lumped into the one or two general education classes per grade. Often these students are far behind grade level, and their teachers are not supported and often harassed by administration. 

Teachers are treated very poorly here- Forbes did it as an AP and a Principal - she puts down good teachers and does not provide any means of help or support - even when hiring young moldable teachers. ",5,0,0,2013-04-17T13:51:35,0.75,0.149,0.442,0.059000000000000004,0.8740000000000001,0.174,0.7879999999999999,0.019,0.245,0.6729999999999999,0.042,0.302

I also want to point out the great organization and responsiveness of the administrative staff. The school changed principals year before last and there was no drama and the school systems went along as usual. I had experience with changing principals as a very active parent in my children’s elementary school and the calm process at ME was miraculous. I have not been as an active a parent at ME, but I do commend the Parent Leadership and their work. I also appreciate that all of the students really have the opportunity to develop their own personalities and personal styles. The students are expressive and confident in what they do. My other son is not as academically focused his older brother, but he is working very hard (and we, his parents are too) at making sure he gets the support he needs. Yet, my second son enjoys ME just as much albeit in different ways. He is much more social (which is part of the challenge) and into sports and dance. All of the students must take an instrument and it is refreshing that they all learn and develop an appreciation for music, visual arts, and dance. ME has been and continues to be a journey (location and fifth floor walk up not withstanding) and a very worthwhile educational experience.",2,0,0,2017-04-03T15:54:07,0.75,0.054000000000000006,0.28600000000000003,0.114,0.723,0.135,0.589,0.10800000000000001,0.297,0.45399999999999996,0.10300000000000001,0.182

Classes are small, teachers and administration are attentive and respectful, the academics are rigorous, the arts offerings are excellent, and the student body is diverse and close-knit. The staff at Manhattan East is stable, with little turnover from year to year, probably because they seem to genuinely love teaching children at this age, and because the principal speaks of the staff and students with great respect. Mr. Genao and Ms. Cancel are extremely responsive to parent concerns, and the students themselves say that bullying is not tolerated at Manhattan East. After a difficult social environment during her last two elementary school years, my child has been warmly welcomed and accepted just as she is at Manhattan East.

04M224,Ella Klomfas,manhattan,Middle,185,"I am currently a seventh grader and I attend this school. I know they say not to point out specifics but this is positive so maybe make an exception. I would like to personally thank Ms. Barnes (6&7th grade math teacher) and Mr. Duffy (6&7th grade English teacher) and Mr. Handibode (6&7th grade History teacher) for being exceptional teachers that allow all of us to blossom and learn more about the world and about how to solve expressions and equations using variables and fractions and how to pick out different themes from songs, books, poems and more! They are three of the best teachers I have ever had including the other teachers who are not bad just not the ones that came to mind when I thought ""who are the best teachers at the school?"" Hopefully we can change a few things though. Such as some of the many musical instruments we have are getting rusty and they are falling apart such as the trumpets. They fall apart while you ae playing them and all the good ones someone took home with them and basically never gave them back. Another thing that needs to be taken care of quick is the bathroom situation. The girls bathroom has writing on the wall saying some means things such as ""so and so is a freak"" (which happened to my friend). They also need some air freshener or something because it STINKS in there!! Other than those small mishaps, I would highly recommend this school to all you fifth graders or fifth grade parents looking for a good school for their children. Here the students and teachers  feel like family and at the same time your children will blossom and learn more and will get community service hours, elective, football club, musical instruments, talent shows, dances, party's, extra credit events, school lunches, a site to keep track of your work progress, wonderful teachers and staff members, friends, and most of all a wonderful community of people who want to learn and teachers who are going to do that for you.",1,0,0,2016-02-22T04:23:30,0.75,0.054000000000000006,0.28600000000000003,0.114,0.723,0.135,0.589,0.10800000000000001,0.297,0.45399999999999996,0.10300000000000001,0.182
04M224,NYCviaFLA,manhattan,Middle,185,"My son had a wonderful middle school experience at Manhattan East.  I've sung its praises to many local parents trying to make middle school decisions.  I always say, first, that I underestimated how valuable I'd find having ONLY middle-schoolers around my kid.  The staff and faculty have a deep understanding of that age, and they keep them sheltered enough to let them be playful kids while encouraging responsibility and independence.  
Second, I tell parents that the school is full of interesting, creative kids.  The administration makes of point of celebrating individuality among both students and teachers (that's one reason the kids don't wear uniforms).  Because all kids are appreciated for themselves, there's little cliquishness and social jockeying for popularity.  My son had positive relationships with most kids, and when he ran into personality conflicts, teachers and administrators were keyed into them and gently helped the kids work through their differences.  
When I talk to deciding parents, I also make sure to describe the challenging and stimulating work the ME teachers have students do. The ELA curriculum reads like a syllabus for a college literature seminar, complete with group discussions about complex topics related to the books they're reading, such as The Outsiders, Of Mice and Men, The Giver, 1984, and many, many more.  Science, social studies and especially the 8th grade math teachers all gave my son freedom to work beyond what was being done in the classroom when he was in need of more challenge.  They were well-prepared for whatever standardized tests came their way, but what's much better, they led their classrooms with much more interesting and challenging goals in mind.  They also offered a wide variety of electives, including some unusual ones like cartooning and African dance.  And they welcomed the kids to hang out in their classrooms at lunch. One teacher ran a Dungeons and Dragons club during lunch that became the highlight of my son's 8th grade year.  Plus the value of my son learning an instrument cannot be underestimated.  He capped off his experience with an exciting trip to the Jazz Band competition at Six Flags.  It's particularly telling that Manhattan East won for ""Esprit de Corps,"" an award given to the school with the most engaged, excited, and cooperative student performers.  The respect and pride the students have for their teacher, their music, and their school must have shown bright and clear to the judges.
Lastly, I want to give a shout out to the principal and assistant principal, both of whom developed close personal relationships with my son and every kid in the school.  I spent enough time volunteering in the school to notice how well they knew all the kids and how easily they joked and chatted with them about school work, friendships, and odd-ball interests like Star Trek or ice cream flavors.  At the same time they suffered no nonsense from the kids, they both clearly loved being with the kids and seeing them grow from 6th graders--still little kids--to 8th graders--on the cusp of adulthood.  I'm so grateful these two generous women ran the school my son attended in these formative and boisterous years.",1,0,0,2015-07-25T20:13:18,0.75,0.054000000000000006,0.28600000000000003,0.114,0.723,0.135,0.589,0.10800000000000001,0.297,0.45399999999999996,0.10300000000000001,0.182
04M224,Discerningmom,manhattan,Middle,185,"Parents who are looking for an outstanding education in a small middle school should seriously consider Manhattan East. The academics are challenging, infused with art and music classes; all are taught at accelerated levels in small classroom settings with individualized instruction. My son just graduated from ME, and I am happy to report that the school does not solely teach to the state exams. Watching The curriculum included many projects throughout the year in every class, and the teachers are well versed in advancing students within the classroom as needed, from which my son greatly benefited! The students' lives are enriched from reading Steinbeck and Shakespeare beginning in 7th Grade, as well as from first rate art and music classes. Watching my son do homework in 6th Grade was very interesting, as he read, wrote Perfect Paragraphs and history papers, solved complex mathematical problems and practiced Spanish pronunciation and grammar, only to then take out his saxophone to compose a small piece based on the music theory he had just learned at ME. I thought to myself, now that's the well rounded Renaissance-like education I had always wanted for him! Principal Lilliana Sarro is warm and inviting, as is the school's environment, always making sure that students had (and continue to have) outstanding programs and teachers. Assistant Principal Melissa Cancel is supportive and responsive as well, and they will both be missed. I think it's important to know that I always felt welcomed at ME, while my child always felt encouraged to flourish and grow.

For parents who are concerned about guidance into high school, Carmen Ocasio is the best guidance counselor I have ever experienced. Not only did she offer us continuous support from the end of 7th Grade through 8th Grade, while taking us through the high school interviewing process step by step, she was also available by phone and/or email. I am very pleased that my son will be attending Beacon High School in September!

We are all grateful to have had such a wonderful middle school experience at Manhattan East, and will greatly miss the truly caring staff, teachers and administrators. They made quite an impression upon us and I know they will on other families as well. I noticed recently that applications to ME are now available online at the Manhattan East website.

04M224,Queens_Parent,manhattan,Middle,185,"ME indeed attracts many students (possibly even a majority of students) who are serious about making their careers in the arts.  However, the bigger issue for your brother is that ME does not offer an intermediate classical strings program, altho in the past, it has offered elementary strings. ME does have an excellent jazz band, so if your brother would be willing to learn double bass, he could have a wonderful experience at the school.  In the past, ME has had students who came in as guitar, electric bass, or cello players who made the transition successfully to double bass.  Please note that all students accepted to ME pick an instrument suited for symphonic band, and learn to play that instrument.  The symphonic band is amazing!   My son came in as a guitar player and learned to play tenor sax at ME. He played in both the jazz band and symphonic band at ME, and was subsequently accepted to LaGuardia HS.  Generally, learning another instrument increases a student's overall musicianship.  Otherwise, if your brother's heart is set on cello, he would be better off trying to apply to middle schools that have an orchestra or strings program.  You are right to think about this early.  There are not many middle schools with decent instrumental music programs, and many are selective, so please encourage your brother to also do well on his state ELA and math exams.

Writing is given across the curriculum, including Mathematics and Science, and classes correlate well in their projects and topics. The teachers' goals are not only to get their students ready for state exams, but to get them ready for their lives ahead of them. The school's focus is on producing independent thinkers who can meet any challenge, and the Socratic method is often used in class discussions. My child enjoys going to school every morning, and for the first time in years, comes home happy every day full of interesting information he loves to share. The teachers are patient in answering all questions parents ask of them, and are truly caring about each student's progress.

The administration has been addressing your concern, and has been actively recruiting students since last year. My child accompanied the Assistant Principal and Manhattan East's very fine art instructor to one of those school fairs last year, of which there were many. Perhaps the program could have started a bit earlier, but it is in full swing and is being approached very seriously. Of course, it takes a while to see results from any program, but it is working and many parents in other boroughs are just not aware of this wonderful school. Manhattan East offers excellent teaching, in an environment that makes it easy on students to transition from elementary school into middle school. The school also has concerned and highly motivated parents, including a new treasurer who is in the financial field, working in every aspect of the school. To see it all in action is very different from hearing about it, and no one can fault you for that. As a parent, you have every right to information, but actual information...
not just what is being said in a given community.

So far within the 2013-2014 school year the school has gone through three principals. The staff is constantly changing and there is no stability in anything. My child started their first year there in Sept 2013, since then my child has has had at least 5 science teachers, 4 ELA teachers, 3 Spanish teachers, and 2 technology teachers. When asking the the principal why this was happening, we were told these teachers were hired and then later let go or switched to other classrooms because they did not meet the standards that they were looking for. I'm confused why hire teachers that don't meet the school's standards? The teachers don't read IEP's for special education. I have to call constantly to have them read my child's IEP and have them follow it. I was assured that the school did cater to children with special needs and the truth is yes they accept special ed students but no they do not adhere to IEP's, nor care to unless you bring it up to them first and insist that they read them. There is also a big problem with discipline in this school. The children are out of control in the classroom and the teachers don't know how to handle them. The so called Deans of discipline just yell and intimidate the children, follow them as they walk from class to class, hand out detention, and claim to be the eyes and ears of the school. But under their watch my child was hurt and bullied by other classmates. And lastly my child is present at school every day and on time, yet I continuously receive phone calls saying my child was late or my child was absent.

04M372,Disappointed Parent,manhattan,Middle,215,"This particular school is absolutely
atrocious. Actual Teachers are very minimal to none. You don’t get to
talk to a teacher about your kids at Parent Teacher Meeting because there is no
such thing as a Parent Teacher Meeting. The students tell you what they have
done and they have 5 Min. to tell you. After that, its next kid and set of
parents.



Almost everyone you get to speak to is an
assistant or some advisor. No one can claim the title of teacher. They are all
sarcastic with the kids, disrespectful and they do not communicate with the
parents at all. The child will tell the parent what is going on before the
school even attempts to contact you. Messages are sent with the children
opposed to an official document or a phone call.



The Principal is not Parent facing at all,
you never get to see, hear or speak to the principal, only the “principal’s secretary”.
You call to speak to someone, you always have to leave a message and hope
someone will call you back.



Contacting the District is useless, they do
not assist nor do they care to contact you to work with you (Birds of a feather
I always say).



The facility itself is very nice, the staff
and management needs to either be properly trained or replaced all together. 



All in all, my kids are getting a very bare
minimal education at this school. What they have learned is the following:

They can’t voice their opinions
among themselves because they will be reprimanded
They will get penalized for
just about everything
They cannot have personal items
because it will discard in the trash (Staff will even go into a student’s bag
to accomplish this)
They have learned what low
self-esteem is



I do not recommend this school at all, I
would suggest you steer clear of this facility and placed your children in a
school that is established.",5,0,0,2012-03-06T14:32:31,0.75,0.307,0.34,0.042,0.9079999999999999,0.223,0.8140000000000001,0.047,0.121,0.805,0.019,0.242

You call speak with her secretary then her secretary gets back to you and it's like that until you demand to have a meeting with her. Most teachers there do not respect the kids. I wish I would've listened to the people who warned me about this school. So please BEWARE and don't send your child here.

""How to do we resolve this?"" was the lead question that was asked publicly by Garg and what led to much opposition. I honestly think that many parents keep things as is in order to weed out working class families who are looking for a good solid education, as you really need the resources of time and money to supplement a child's education that this school does not provide. 

PROSPECTIVE PARENTS BE WARNED: this school will require you as a parent to do a lot of your own teaching at home, or provide the extra-curricular studies and tutoring. There are ZERO assessments done at the school as far as fundamental skills building is concerned so assessments will have to be done on your own to find out if your child is meeting the skills for his or her grade level. Report cards are handwritten by teachers and really don't provide the practical feedback that parents need. There is an expectation from parents to much of the work in math and ELA fundamental skills building. For a full-time working parent this is tough. You are going to need to buy workbooks or enroll in online supplemental education sites (Khan Academy, etc.) or tutoring lessons and do this every day in order for your child not to fall behind and be ready for middle school.",0,1,0,2017-09-20T16:09:36,0.75,0.057999999999999996,0.276,0.0,0.514,0.09,0.28800000000000003,0.10300000000000001,0.135,0.391,0.28800000000000003,0.209

Re: ""East Harlem School's Utopian Spirit Devolves into a War"" (May 18): 

The article presents a false picture of the ""war"" at Central Park East 1. It is not a case of out-of-district parents trying to keep local families of color from the school. Rather, it is the overwhelming majority of a school community-- Black and Latino, White, Asian and Biracial, low-income and middle class, in district and out--joining together to preserve a progressive education that has been CPE 1's hallmark for four decades. 

Department of Education officials handpicked a principal, Monica Garg, who would break down that tradition, and after months of trying to work with the principal, parents decided we could no longer trust her with our children. The breaking point for many was when Ms. Garg spearheaded official investigations of longtime teachers, questioning children without notifying their parents. Seven-year-olds were asked about incidents that occurred two years prior and were told to keep their interviews secret. 

Seventy percent of CPE 1 students are children of color, who come from both inside and outside the district in order to attend a school as diverse, progressive, and quality as CPE1.

The most important thing I can say about CPE is that he is truly happy there.  He was not happy to be leaving his friends behind, but he soon changed his tune once he recognized the vast differences at CPE.  For the first time since pre-school, he is invested in his work and actually enjoying it.  He is thinking again, not just doing robotic test prep work.  And now when I ask about his day, he is actually excited to talk about what he did and learned.  I am equally happy.  The teachers, parents, principal- everyone!- all feel very welcoming and invested in the kids.  In my opinion, this is what school should be.  A space where kids are respected and cherished, where kids' voices and ideas are equally valued.

""CPE1 understands that children learn in many different ways and does not subscribe to the one-size-fits-all mentality. The school deemphasizes standardized testing and instead focuses on how to teach children to think for themselves with the idea that true thoughtfulness translates into increased interest and a greater appetite for learning in general. The thing that struck me the first time I toured CPE1 was the total engagement that I witnessed in both students and teachers.&nbsp;... The teachers are phenomenal and have the highest level of dedication. The school's method of child-based learning requires that each teacher really understand the individual child - and they do. This small environment allows all the kids to know one another and it is a regular sight at CPE1 to see upper-grade children supporting the lower grade students in and outside of the classrooms. Parent involvement at the school is incredibly high. The school has true racial and ecomomic diversity and puts a very high emphasis on community/social events rather than focusing on fundraising.

04M610,z.z.,manhattan,Middle,166,"PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!! LOTS to say about this one.. in all honesty please do not send your child here. firstly the grad rate. TYWLS loves to brag about our 100% graduation rate but it's actually a lie. I've spoken to former tywls students who HAVE been dropped. yes, dropped. TYWLS will find juniors who are not doing well their junior year and drop them from the school. This allows the rest of the juniors who are doing well to move on to senior year ensuring they will graduate. I'm not exactly sure if they help these students find new schools to transfer to or they just drop them without any direction butttttttt...... also to add on, my friend had told me once she had a meeting with Ms.Colleen about her grades (Drew is no longer our principal) and was essentially told to only focus on one class and fail the other she was struggling in because it would be too difficult to handle both. I know it sounds ridiculous and hard to believe but if you were a student you would understand. It's awful our staff don't encourage us to try our best when really all they care about is their reputation. Ms.Colleen is a bit lost and doesn't seem like a principal figure, really Ms.Vega (the vice principal) is the one who takes that role although she doesn't have the title. However Ms.Vega isn't the greatest either. She can be a bit mean here and there and sometimes seems to be too preoccupied to help students when they really need it or might need somebody to talk to. Now, the ""sisterhood"". TYWLS claims to be a supportive environment when in all honesty the staff don't really care about you. again, for them it's all about reputation. Girls aren't really nice to each other and lots of bullying takes place but it's also an all girl's school so i think bullying/mean girls is inevitable no matter what. Again, bringing back the word ""reputation"", we don't talk to ANY of our sister schools in the other boroughs AT ALL and tywls east harlem only really cares about themselves (aka NOT the other tywls schools in nyc) and their OWN (say it with me) r e p u t a t i o n!!! opportunities here and there which is one pro. Also academics is really all about the student i find it to be pretty easy while other's find it challenging. But teachers honestly can't grade and will hand out 70s all the time instead of actually grading fairly. However, ( i forget the name of these group of students) who have extra time and shorter tests, etc actually get easier work!! I'm in the normal track. and for example while everyone in the normal track might do bad on this one math test the other students with ""shorter"" but really easier tests often pass with flying colors!! I've seen one of my friend's grades who is part of this group and she has all 90's in her classes meanwhile I'm in the normal track struggling to bring my geomotry grade up to an 80! It's really unfair seeing kids on honor roll who really didn't earn that spot and seeing them all of a sudden act all cocky and treat me with sympathy as if i don't get the material.

TYWLS has been such an amazing school and I'm glad I have gotten the chance to attend (I wish I came in 6th grade!) The teachers are so supportive, and are there to tell you reality and push you to do your best. I remember having an issue with punctuality and the amount of support and care I received from my teachers that all came together to help me stop it was beyond heart warming. Also, the school has such a nice bond and spirit where we really do come together as sisters to get things done. For example, with the recent political climate and election, juniors and seniors organized a walkout protest to protest about the injustice happening. The amount of opportunities here are also great as we are a CBI (College Bound Initiative) school in which we have a college counselor who takes time to help us with the college process. For instance, I have college counseling class two times a week in my schedule (which is great because not a lot of schools have that). No school is perfect and so, there are some downsides. Such as how we have a small gym that is also our auditorium. But, we are still able to play sports and we do in fact have a joined sports team with two neighboring schools nearby in which we use one of the school's gym (so it kinda all works out!). Also, we do have to take the elevator to school and Mon-Thurs after school (as the lines might be long but...sometimes it comes in handy! because it could be pretty tiring to walk up nine flight up stairs). We do though, take the stairs for changing classrooms. As it is a small school, our school is located in an office building and so floors 7-11 are ours. TYWLS EH being a small school is a great advantage because you really get that one on one support from all the staff and teachers. I've never felt such a sense of community and love from a school that empowers women, our educational future, and what it truly means to be a leader and lead the way for our future and those to come after.

1.The teachers want to treat the students like adults.  I think that should be expected by the end of the middle school years, not the first year coming from an elementary school. Most 11/12 year olds need as much support as possible while they're entering a new environment, encountering new policies and going through puberty.
Parent support: i must call the main office  212 289-7593about 6 times(maybe more) before i finally speak to someone. I've also emailed the teachers and one teacher responds half the time, the other teacher never responds.
2. Management: Finding a good school your child can attend through 12th grade is usually a positive for parents. We assume that the older students would set an example and the teachers can manage the students.  Well, not the case!  There is a student that bullies a lot of the other students. She steals from them, threatens, hits and verbally abuses them.  My daughter witnessed a fight in one class and saw the teacher turn her head to the opposite direction.  She doesn't feel safe, didn't want to go to school and feels like the teachers are too afraid to address the situation.
Elevator mgmt: students are required to be there by 8:40. She has to stand on line to wait for one of two elevators.  One time she was on line at 8:32, but since seniors have priority they get to skip the line.  Whenever this occurs, she is marked late.
3.Violin program: The question is what Violin program.  They hand a student a violin and they say practice.  In elementary school she met in a small group with a violin teacher twice a week and had beautiful concerts. She amazed so many.  Now her skills are regressing. In the beginning of the year she had her first TYWLS  concert.  I left work early, invited 4 family members and 1 friend.  Oh my goodness, how unbelievably embarrassed I was.  The ""concert"" lasted literally 3 minutes. I spent more time waiting for the concert to start.  Did i mention they had to dress up for this 3 min concert or they would recieve an F for music for that quarter. Then they had the nerves to announce that the so called concert was just to get parents in for a PTA meeting.  I was so furious and have not gone to one PTA meeting!  Deception is not the way to get parents involved.
4.My daughter really wants me to mention the food issue as well. It's public school lunch, so not much can be expected. However, cleaniness can and should be controled . She found a bug in her food one time.  The window guard above the food is dirty. The water containers are dirty. 
I have started to look into other schools.  This time I'm not letting reputation convince me and I will ask to speak to the new students. ",0,0,0,2016-03-07T19:51:15,0.75,0.036000000000000004,0.187,0.0,0.816,0.16899999999999998,0.693,0.07200000000000001,0.289,0.59,0.024,0.12
04M610,Harlem_insider,manhattan,Middle,166,"I also have a 6th grader at TYWLS and I sympathize with some of your complaints.  Communication for me with teachers has been great, but not so much so with the administration.  I have e-mailed one of the principals and never received a response.  They generally give very short notice about events, changes to the schedule, etc.  I too was very upset about the ""concert""/trick-parents-to-attend-the-PTA-meeting!  On top of that, some parents were lectured by a PTA dad when they decided not to stay for the PTA meeting.  I have attended some meetings and felt they were disorganized and a waste of my time.  My lunch complaint is that my daughter says they never have much time to eat.  She brings lunch from home, and even without having to wait in line, there is still little time.

I will say that my daughter has spoken to me about one particular 6th grade bully, but I know that when her adviser became aware of the situation, she thought of ways to intervene.  Although the girl is still having issues (not easily solved by teachers), it has not gotten so bad that my daughter didn't want to be there.  In fact, she wants to stay there through high school.  My daughter has teachers that she really, really likes and often comes home talking about exciting lessons both in class and in the after school program, Girls, Inc.  I feel that the teachers are genuinely invested in my daughter's education.  Girls, Inc has been a great way to spend the extended day.  My daughter has gotten to participate in some really interesting and engaging activities through them and I know that they are really looking to ensure her success in school.

As someone who sees firsthand what can go wrong in middle & high schools, I have to say that TYWLS is doing better than most.  There is definitely room for improvement, especially on the communication front (I hope the principals are reading this- you need to respond to parents, too!).

However, after spending three years at this institution I must say that I wouldn't trade it for any other school if given the choice. Many of the students are passionate and strong willed, which only pushed me to step out of my shell and develop a powerful voice myself. Leaving middle school, I was afraid that I'd be just another face in crowd, but the support and sense of camaraderie between the students, teachers, and staff eased all of my concerns. Most of the teachers make lessons engaging and are there for students for academic help, but they are also almost always ready to lend an ear and give us support on circumstances beyond the classroom walls. Of course no school is perfect and not all of the student body will have the same views as I do, but it is important to remember that the faculty and the administration are not solely responsible for giving each student a spectacular experience. We as students must also take initiative to make it the best four years    (or seven years if you are entering the school as a sixth grader) it could possibly be. We must take advantage of all the resources and support given to us.

It's rare to see Althea out of her office or even around the school monitoring or observing classes, it seems like the only people working are the vice principals and as if she doesn't care. Certain teachers are not doing their job and let us hang out in class. The gym is way too small and because of that some of us have to exercise in the hallway or just don't participate at all. The staff can be very rude and get annoyed when you ask simple questions or for assistance. There is a somewhat small amount of bullying and fighting. The only good things are that the teachers give you enough work to get you thinking, although the grading can be a little hard. We also have spirit week which is very fun, and a great camping trip. A word of advice: If you are an incoming 9th grader I would suggest you enter this school with friends, or that you are social because most of the people are already in cliques or have their own group of friends when you get there which can make making friends difficult.

However, the principal makes it impossible for parents to feel comfortable contributing and participating in their child's education. Teachers are willing to speak with parents, but express concern that the principal will retaliate if she hears that they are working with parents without her knowledge. The principal is a knowledgeable educator but uses aggression and shame throughout her interactions with the children and parents. She has publicly shamed children, targeted specific children, ignored parents emails requesting social and emotional support,  blamed the victim in bullying experiences, and spoke poorly about parents to other parents.  Meetings she runs quickly move from focusing on  school issues and move to her personal gripes with parents, students or other staff. Her unprofessionalism makes it difficult for a child with special needs to get the services they need if she disagrees with the plan. She runs the school through intimidation and fear. Parents, kids and staff are afraid of her. This is not appropriate for a school. Beyond the principal there are wonderful, supportive and smart staff members.

04M964,parent,manhattan,K-8,452,"The CPE2 community is still one of the best examples I've ever seen of families and educators who bring a great deal of diversity, dedication, and a commitment to keeping arts and music in the curriculum. That said, our family's overall experience has been more negative than positive due to two major problems. First and sadly, influencing and overshadowing everything else, the principal is nearly impossible to work with. Her aggressive, controlling, and disrespectful persona has students, parents, and teachers giving up on contributing to CPE2 or asking for their special needs to be met and just trying to stay out of her way so as not to get yelled at. She publicly shames students and teachers, often for behavior that she arbitrarily decides was unacceptable after the fact. This all by itself is enough for us to have stopped recommending the school to other families and instead to have begun warning them away. But there is a second major problem and this has to do with CPE2's approach to the Common Core curriculum and the introduction of high stakes testing. I share the rejection of high stakes testing but the campaign to force all students into opting out was not well thought out or carried out; instead of reducing stress levels for students we found that students were more anxious, even if they didn't have to take the actual test, because they heard it talked about so much, were falsely led to believe that it would be their own responsibility if their teachers were fired for the school not having high enough test scores, and they were bringing home hours of test prep homework anyway. This is the nucleus of the testing problem in my opinion: the more damaging aspect is not the test itself, but the choice by a school that calls itself progressive to abandon project-based learning in favor of lots of classroom test prep and heavy homework loads based on worksheets the teachers are downloading from the NYS Common Core website. We chose CPE2 because we believe in the progressive philosophy; it is a curriculum which, when done well, is actually more rigorous than mainstream curriculums and which builds students who are better at skills like critical analysis, problem solving, independent research and learning. Our child, however, only participated in one major project, in third grade social studies, in the entire time at CPE2. Otherwise both class time and homework time were taken up by worksheets or timed independent reading (the focus was on number of minutes read in order to ""build up stamina"" for how long the testing would require instead of on understanding content or engaging in characters and stories) which had no relevant context other than the Common Core standards.
In short, CPE2 has been completely demoralizing for our family and we can't imagine things will get better as long as the current principal is in charge. We certainly wouldn't encourage anyone to enroll here and we suspect the new middle school will be plagued by the same issues.",0,0,0,2015-07-26T17:13:31,0.75,0.033,0.28300000000000003,0.02,0.6609999999999999,0.111,0.502,0.053,0.319,0.409,0.14800000000000002,0.267

staff, teachers, and parents (in front of kids), indiscriminately and for
completely bizarre reasons. She also lies and makes up ""facts"" to

inspiration in the past and could certainly be called ""dedicated,""
but the reality is she needs to retire. With everything, it's ""her way or
the highway"" which impacts the morale of everyone she touches. She
literally bombarded parents this year with emails urging them to ""opt out""
of state exams and then had the audicity to tell everyone (again by email) that
she was ""working hard"" for those who still chose to take the tests. The
teachers are great, but if you're looking for a ""progressive""

The teachers do as they are told by her. You send a teacher an email they verify the email with the principal first if the email doesn't meet the principal standards she tells them not to answer. So what is the use of emailing to set up an appointment.  Instead of the Principal listening to the parent side and the teacher side she listen to the teacher and talks down to the parents.

In this day and age where so many schools teach to test rather than teach to learn I think CPE II provides the proper balance of both.  I find the teachers to be very genuine and truly want the children to succeed.  I think that the class sizes are very small for public school and this allows for more individualized attention. The teachers and administration are very accessible not only to parents but to students as well.  The schools healthy eating policy is a God send, and all schools should follow suit.  The swimming, ice skating, visits to Central Park, and offering of after school sports programs lend to this healthy environment as well.

The classes are small (20 kids) with a head teacher, an experienced para and parent helpers. Every semester classes get student teachers from schools like Bank Street. This creates a great teacher/child ratio and infuses the school with energy and fresh ideas. There is a staff librarian, art and music/movement teachers and math, science and literacy specialists. All of whom know every child and can discuss their interests at the drop of a hat.  My son started in pre-k and is now in 1st grade. He is happy, confident and enthusiastic about learning. His teachers are all energetic, nurturing and highly effective educators. He reads at at a 5th grade level. He's learning math concepts that make the subject fun and relatable to his experience. In a class that combines kindergarden and 1st grade students every child gets individual attention that is suitable to their level.</p>

There are two grades to a class, one teacher and parent paras. I think with classroom size so large, Ms. Noami should not hire parents to work with children unless they have the experience. Public Schools are about working together in a close enviroment with teachers and parents and principal together. If you want your child to learn at a certain level then CPE 2 is not the school.

Fact: The middle school has had almost a 100 percent turnover for four years in a row.

After teaching here my first year, I had to leave as the political climate is not one where you can grow professionally. Teachers are subjected to blame when administrators are seeking scapegoats. When teachers complete PDs they have to beg to be paid even if it was already determined you would get paid. Many effective and highly effective teachers coming here suddenly become developing and ineffective- even those teaching for 25+ years. 

Students there are transient, which is not their fault. This school is surrounded by the most domestic violence shelters. Many face challenges in which even the wellness center could not and sometimes did not address when teachers made recommendations. Students are angry and for valid reasons; however, this often comes at the price of jeopardizing teachers' safety and no one addresses this. Additionally this jeopardizes untenured teacher to be subjected to serious allegations made by students - and often the politics are not in your favor so you can expect investigations done in students' favors and your teaching record tarnished or worse... (this happened to multiple middle school and elementary school teachers this year.)

05M125,John Lennox,manhattan,Elementary,250,"Going back a few years to 1950 - that's when I attended PS 125, following my older brother and sisters foot steps. A very nurturing school with most of the teachers coming from Columbia University. It was a school filled with neighborhood children (Whites, Blacks, Latinos) when Harlem was really rocking it was a very culturally mixed area at the time. I lived like a block away on a little known street called 'La Salle St', before they moved us out to put up the Morningside Projects. It was a true 'village' at that time, every one watched out for each other, we were what's called 'latch key kids' where neighbors watched over us while most parents were at work. Home work was done before we were allowed to play out side and our neighbors made sure of that, our we'd be in trouble. But all in all PS125 was very instrumental in our growth. Back in those days our eye's were opened to many experiences that were made available by the Gunggenheim and Rockefeller family endowments (free lunches, free dental, outings to the Symphony and opera, etc., etc.) too numerous to mention. I guess I'll cut off for now, or else this will turn into a multi volume book.

At Pre-k and K, my daughter goes to outside everyday and learn about bees and tree and how tree become material for a house, etc.  Now, every time we talk about a bee, she teaches us things about a bee and honey.  Inquiry-based learning requires teachers to listen and pay attention to children's curiosity. I have been impressed how their everyday activities evolves (e.i. from a tree to a house) and how their learning at school is grounded to our everyday life. 

I didn't want my child to sit at the desk and memorized information like I have done when I was a kid.

students from 125 jumped off the auditorium balcony and slid down the curtains to the floor. students from 125 as young as 2nd grade picked up ice and threw it at CSS students, injuring several. whenever we pass each other in the halls, some of the older kids from 125 insult us with language quite inappropriate for theirs or any age. whenever we go to the principal about behavior issues,she dismisses us and does absolutely nothing. and to top it all off, i have met exactly one teacher who enjoys teaching. most teachers are rude, manhandle the children (truly, it's disgusting) and insult them in front of them, and most ARE LACKING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TEETH! once, i was going to gym when a kindergarten class passed by. i leaned over to my friend to comment, ""Aw! how cute!"" the teacher turned to me with a scowl. ""Cute? CUTE? why don't YOU try taking care of them! They are NOT cute!"" and marched her class away from us without another word. the parents will try to tell you differently, but i've seen it from the inside, and i do not like what i see.",0,0,0,2012-01-11T03:27:27,1.0,0.024,0.212,0.124,0.6970000000000001,0.096,0.56,0.036000000000000004,0.40399999999999997,0.368,0.14800000000000002,0.34600000000000003

05M125,Mchafets,manhattan,Elementary,250,"As a parent who currently has a child in Kindergarten at PS 125, I would like to correct some of the inaccurate information in this review, which I believe was posted by a family not attending the school. Swimming instruction is provided by the same organization that provided it last year, ""Swim Swim Swim I say"". Speaking from our own experience, my daughter's K class, as well as families from the Pre-K class, are delighted with the quality of the swim instruction and the kids seem to love it. 

Asphalt Green generously provided free instruction to a limited number of students last year, but they do not offer instruction to younger age groups (pre-K and K) and so we are thankful that a different organization was brought in to offer what is undoubtedly one of the best and most unique experiences in NYC public education.

With regard to the dual French program, Ms. Espinal has wisely responded to a change in circumstance: a French charter school opened in the neighborhood this year and drew a number of local families interested in French-English education.  PS 125 does, however, provide a French enrichment program, and while I can’t speak to it directly (our daughter is in the Spanish dual language class), parents in the French enrichment program seem quite happy. 

Our experience at PS 125 has been quite outstanding (like every school there are particular areas of strength and areas that could be improved), and I am sorry that the poster expressed his/her dissatisfaction with a personal attack on Ms. Espinal, who is widely regarded as an exemplary principal.  More importantly, Ms. Espinal is truly pouring her heart into P.S. 125 to make it a top-notch neighborhood school. We think she is great and hope to see her continued to success.

05M133,ElleCee,manhattan,Elementary,198,I'm sorry I never seen your comment. Yes my son did and still does attend the Horizon program at 133. This will be his 3rd school year there. It's not the best school and if I could I would bring him closer to home. This is the only school in Manhattan that offers Horizon. The program is great. The faculty all know who my son is and he knows them. They are very inclusive when it comes to special needs kids and the typical kids. Most of the staff have been great but some are just really a pain to deal with. They call you for every little thing that really has no importance. My son loves the principal and the assistant principal. Whenever the children from Horizon are having something done in class like a play and so on both the principal and assistant principal are sitting along side in the classroom supporting the kids. My son has had some issues with being bullied. Nothing too serious but it has happened enough times. It's usually from the same 2 children who are both in the Horizon program. While I'm happy my son is in the program I am not happy that I have to send him all the way to Harlem. He gets on the school bus at 6:30am and school doesn't start till around 8:15.

It also sounds like a typical NYC classroom with Special Education services. Unfortunately, the ""down side"" issue of this academic environment is a life saver for some of the children with less severe emotional problems. Any parent that has or has had a child enrolled in a distric 75 (the district that is in charge of the most severe cases of special education) school would never trade an environment like the one at PS 154 for a District 75 school because it is simply heartbreaking. We are talking about an environment where children have probation officers visit them, that's how severe it is. So when you place a child who is in need of let's say anger management in an enviroment with children who are accustomed to criminal activity and who come from broken homes the result is disastrous.

She is more interested in being friends with the teachers than supervising them.  Teachers often call children names, shout at them, humiliate them in class and make false accusations, but face no repercussions. The principal seems to be afraid to discipline the staff. 
The elementary grades have many teachers who are incapable of managing their classrooms.  The school’s staff is in desperate need of professional development to understand how to treat children and parents with respect and courtesy.  The children are disrespectful only in reaction to the way they are treated by the staff.  Sad to say but many of the adults at this school do not set a tone for respect and therefore should not cry foul against our children.  
Teacher bullying is the norm at this school.  Teachers bully kids about their uniform, about wearing sweaters when it is cold, and even how they do math problems.  
I am a very dissatisfied parent and I have made a formal complaint to the DOE. My children and I are merely counting down the days until the school year ends because they will never set foot on the premises while the current administration exists.  In addition I will continue to discourage friends and acquaintances from sending their children to this school.   ",9,0,0,2013-04-17T15:30:59,0.75,0.242,0.268,0.115,0.9309999999999999,0.3,0.856,0.017,0.203,0.746,0.025,0.408

The new Principal (Mieasia Edwards) is not a person that you can work with. She is very condescending. She holds personal vendettas against staff members and parents. She is very quickly in passing the buck. She abuses her power of authority, arrogant and she can be very evasive. When speaking to her its really a one mic meeting-hers. Bottom line shes not fit for this community even though she claims to have grown up in Harlem. When speaking to her she makes you believe she is caring and passionate but she's really not. On the other hand the new Assistant Principal (Kerianne Harrison) is approachable. She's open to suggestions and or ideas.",0,0,0,2018-01-11T19:48:10,0.75,0.16399999999999998,0.317,0.087,0.958,0.377,0.9229999999999999,0.011000000000000001,0.568,0.35,0.033,0.321

The school is a much better place now. She thinks she knows best, and she will talk down to anyone who disagrees. She came from a non-education background, spent a few short years in the classroom before she became principal, and now she thinks she is an expert.

What I didnt understand was why the Principal was never there in the mornings when there were many fights in the cafeteria or why when my child didnt behave he spent 3 days with the guidance counselor playing games instead of in detention room, learning. My child was a good student, but I was told he had to stay for 37.5 minutes with the entire school - I thought this was only for students who need extra help. He learned nothing as he was with his whole class, not a small group like extended time is supposed to be. I tried to meet with the administration but the principal didn't show up for our appointment. I changed schools and my son is much happier in a new place - he is learning and not being bullied every day.",1,0,0,2011-08-10T22:29:39,0.75,0.16399999999999998,0.317,0.087,0.958,0.377,0.9229999999999999,0.011000000000000001,0.568,0.35,0.033,0.321

The answer to the situation is a change in administration! Children are rewarded when they are suppose to be punished. Teachers are scolded in front of students and other staff.

I hear your frustration and I see that parents who are actively involved get results.  My suggestion is to organize the parents and sponsor a rally or sit down with the Chancellor about what is taking place.  As you proceed please consider that what you might raise may be used against you as the DOE presses on to replace your school with a charter.,0,0,1,2011-08-09T17:32:36,0.75,0.16399999999999998,0.317,0.087,0.958,0.377,0.9229999999999999,0.011000000000000001,0.568,0.35,0.033,0.321

No excuses and no finger pointing. Furthermore, the apathy you have expressed about the parents demonstrates why the situation has not changed.  They refuse to accept their power and to use it to help their children.  Teachers struggle more with children because many enter  Pre-k lacking 1,500 English words and because of that fact they are already at a loss.  Who should be responsible for getting children ready for the rigors of school and classroom work? parents? teachers? principal? community?

Our
 question to the department of education is: If this is the leader this 
school has, why should we question our children failing?  From an ""A"" 
the school has gone to a ""C"", as the result of this Principal's 
incompetence. The system is once again failing our children! This is a 
needy school and this Principal is not in capacity to assist children, 
community nor the staff!!!!

A few of our concerns are the following:
This
 Principal utilizes the ""P-Card"" for filling up her gas tank while 
commuting to and from PA to NYC instead of utilizing it for children 
like it should be used.
Her attendance is absurd. She makes 
appointments with parents and is never there. She clinically diagnoses 
students and suggests medication.  She continuously divulges her 
personal life. She is always late submitting her documentation but 
always finds a way to talk her way out of situations and blaming others 
for her incompetence. During testing there is always chaos and she 
closes herself behind closed doors and it has been observed that she may
 possibly be changing answers. It has been said that the OSI is involved
 but yet nothing is being done!!! Children are getting hurt during lunch
 because of lack of supervision. You can walk into the building at any 
time and the prep schedule is not being adhere to. Reading Recovery and 
Reading Intervention is not taking place and there is not a 5 day SAVE 
room as mandated by Chancellor's Regs.	     

Her
 husband continues to come in the building. His latest appearance in the
 building was on 10-12-10 through the back doors with keys. His presence
 is very distasteful being that he has sexually harassed an employee of 
the school building.  He is also very intimidating and at the same time 
he is rude. 

Principal claims that Harlem 
Village Academy (Charter School), Harlem Children Zone and P.S. 194 are 
being burglarized.  Who is there to say that it's not her and her 
husband when it has been observed by community individuals that her 
husband enters and exits the building utilizing the back door with a set
 of keys.  She has a problem coming in on time but leaves the school 
building very late at night.

She is rude, belligerent and vindictive towards staff and parents.Please conduct a financial audit because of misuse use of funds (salary/Per-session/etc.).

Where
 are her supervisors? because many staff members and parents have 
complained about the above mentioned situations and it has not been 
addresses!!!

There are dedicated and competent teachers who give their time to ensure student learning. However, the leadership in the school from the Principal to the APs, is a downside. They do not accept responsibility for their role in student failures. Teachers constantly beg, borrow, and well..steal to get much needed supplies, books, and basic learning materials. The administration pits teacher against teacher and does not foster a sense of community. They have been known to harass teachers and act in a very unprofessional manner. CS 200 needs leaders who ASK what teachers need, then follow up by PROVIDING it, or at least trying to address issues. When children fail the ELA exams in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, one must ask why their are not adequate materials and curriculum in the lower grades to get them off to a good start?

05M362,A distraught mother,manhattan,Middle,297,"Personally I love this school. My daughter is currently in the 10th grade and is doing very well, especially with the teacher's focus on their students. I noticed that teachers and students have a unique relationship, in a way where the teachers are always right there to help the student. I normally do not see this in other schools. One thing that bothers me to this day was an interaction that a female Hispanic security guard (I do not know her name) had with my daughter. My daughter and other students were waiting for their teacher and this security guard came by trying to fit in a tight space, (remember it was a crowd of students) and first she said excuse me and the students tried to create a path for her, then I guess the path was not big enough for her, so she decided to holler (not scream, but holler) in my child's ear and roughly push my child to the side, for her to clash into another student. Even though I did not see this for myself, I am aware that this security guard has a history for being disrespectful and belligerent towards these students. As my daughter describes her she ""treats them like criminals."" I even asked some other students from the school who know my daughter and they also say that she can be rough and rude.

Some of the teachers in this school are the best you will find anywhere, but that doesn't matter because the students are disruptive in almost every class unless you take AP classes. It's really sad because some teachers lose their motivation because of had bad the students are. Not every student is disruptive and you'll find students that are ivy bound, but the bad definitely outweighs the good. To be more specific, you will see kids roaming the halls and playing cards in the bathroom or teachers spending half of the class period trying to get students to settle down. 

If your child is focused and can ignore the students, they will succeed in this school, but if not I highly recommend going somewhere better if you have the choice.

Seriously I would think that his cutting class was more important then a sneaker.  I gone to every parent teacher conference and each year that I go I give the teachers my email and phone's number so they could get in contact with me and you would think that these teachers would pick up a phone or email me to tell me that child is not in class. 
I also met with Mr. Gates I told him that the teachers in the school needs to have better communication with the children's parent. He agree with me and my son's father. I have not seen any change in the school.
Even sending a email to the guidance counselor just to get information regarding  grades or regents is like pulling teeth. I'm a parent and i want to know what is going on if I' am sending you a email. I go in person and its a different thing I get my answer's.
I just like any another parent wants to have there child graduate. I have not seen any teacher's in that school show any real interest in the students if there is I must have missed it.

the negative aspects of an otherwise solid institution. I have a daughter at FDA.
She entered her 9th grade year. For the last four years, I have had
the pleasure of knowing that my child is being provided with the best education
experience that the City of New York has to offer. My daughter has improved tremendously
in math and history, subjects that she dreaded in previous years. FDA offers
top notch academic departments that have some of the best teachers in the city
of New York. 


       I worked in the public school system for
twelve years and saw the horrible conditions that some of its schools were in.
FDA is not and has never been one of them. FDA has maintained a level of
excellent and success that is, in my opinion, unprecedented. FDA consistently
sends students to top notch colleges and universities. In fact, just last year
FDA sent an overwhelming 98% of its graduating class to college. Four of those
graduates went on to Ivy League schools. The majority are enrolled in top notch
programs along the eastern seaboard.


      As a parent, I
knew FDA would be a great choice for my child. I am really impressed by Joseph
Gates, FDA’s new principal who has taken the” helm of the ship”. He is steering
FDA in an even greater direction and I hope to work with him more often in the
coming year.

school and speak to some students, teachers, and administrators. Students can provide
the best insight for prospective parents and students. ",7,0,0,2012-11-09T03:23:12,0.25,0.087,0.272,0.105,0.888,0.203,0.815,0.0,0.659,0.297,0.022000000000000002,0.28600000000000003

I am an employee of this school and like to add that everyone's experience is different and please take that into consideration. The school has received bad reviews in the past because under the PREVIOUS administration, things fell to the waste side which caused a deterioration in the school's  policies and procedures. Now, with the new administration under the leadership of Joseph Gates, FDA is headed in a direction that will restore, if not surpass the school's stellar reputation. To the parent who said the school needs to change their policy just like Obama did, we definitely are in the process of doing so. Change and transformation is upon us. To the student who said that Mr. Gates watches you all like hawks and chases students around the building, he is a disciplinarian and someone who desires order- something that was lacking in the past. The school is very very different than before and is headed in a better direction.

So sad that our kids especially teens boys growing into young men has very little choices of where to attend schools at. My teen son just graduated from the middle school and I was hoping to place him into a school with an enviroment that has self controll and staff monitoring. Unfornately I see this school is deff not the right first or last choice I want to place him in. I graduated from IS10 aka FDA back in the late 80s and it was never to that extreme behaviour. In this district where our kids are growing up at we need more kids who are willing to learn but also has self respect for their peers and themselves. teachers and staffs at these schools must also conduct in a proffesional way so that our children will have a positive learning enviroment. Now I must either look outside his district or place him into a private school which will cost me but atleast I can be sure that there will be positive respectful staffs in his circle of learning.

I’ve gotten so many suspensions for things that weren’t my fault, not true, or didn’t get to tell my side for. The teachers would try their hardest to make sure I was out of their class or even suspended and even the guidance counselors unequivocally made sure that everything that happened around me I was blamed for. My entire middle school record was riddled with a bunch of lies and things taken out of context. I had to repeat the 6th grade because of the teachers poorly handling my work.

My twins are currently in 3rd grade and are at different learning levels. Throughout their education here, teachers and administrators have been very supportive of their individual learning levels and what I could do to make sure they both succeed. This was very important to me that they were seen as individuals. My twin-A is on and above grade level; twin-B is below grade level in some subjects. Every teacher since kindergarten has provided me with additional support for twin-B in the subjects she needed it.  This is so helpful to me, as I do my best to support my children’s learning. There has never been a time I have made a request to meet or speak with teacher and the request not been granted. The teachers are so invested in their students! 

In addition to the committed teachers, we have Teachers College Fellows throughout the building supporting our learning. The Fellows are part of the regular school day and the after school programming. Our partnership with TC provides our students with the vast resources that other public schools in district 5 do not.  This is a powerful tool to our success. 

TCCS has always had a small town feel, where teachers and parents care about each other. The parent community is very engaged.  The principal works closely with parents to maximize the best learning environment.  Last year the school was in the mist of transition. Yes, there were parents that were unhappy with the new leadership of the school, and yes, there were parents who had the wait and see approach. But we made it though! 

All children learn at a different pace, and TCCS supports students at their individual levels.  I am proud that we have a diverse community of learners because everyone here supports you. Now we are in our second year under the leadership of Mrs. Verdiner and I am optimistic she will continue to strive of excellence from each student. 

As a parent you need to decide what is important to you.

I was brought up to believe that if you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but this negativity doesn't do anyone any good, especially the kids. All of these reviews that blame the school for their kids issues or that they weren't catered to in a certain way are just bunk. Complainers are never solvers.

 We as parents are responsible for our children's behavior and educational needs. That decision of whether or not a particular school is a good fit or not should be based on your child's specific needs and not because you feel the school won't bend for you. Not every school is a perfect fit. 

 For every person that has a complaint about TCCS I can give you a hundred that just love it. We love it. We are a family. It is a place that supports a child's emotional and educational growth. The staff is just  wonderful and we have made some life long friends in the other families.

05M517,Sad Parents,manhattan,K-8,293,"This school was a nightmare for us. We were so excited to get a spot but it quickly went downhill from there. Our child's teacher was brand new and clearly in over her head. She turned out to be a very poor communicator and though we knew our child was having socialization issues all year long, the teacher was no help at all. When we escalated concerns the the ""administration"" (one ill-experienced new principal who exhibited no leadership skills whatsoever, spoke out of both sides of her mouth oftentimes and paid lip service when it came to ""consequences"" for bullies and other behavior issues.) Our child went to the nurse more than 25 times in one year and there was nobody interested in why that was. If we had known that we would see no improvement over the course of the year (our child's class watched full-length Disney movies every day over the last weeks of school!) we would have taken our child out long before. It was a completely wasted year. The social/emotional issues which were never addressed at school are now blatantly obvious to camp counselors who have done MORE IN THREE WEEKS than our child's teacher did in an entire year. The after school program wasn't any better. Fortunately we had the good sense to withdraw from that problematic environment midyear. 

I absolutely agree that the children and other families in this school are lovely. The community is what kept us going and both my child and I and my spouse made lasting friends at TCCS. (However, there's also a culture of intolerance to criticizing the school, if that makes any sense. At times it felt a bit like we were in Stepford.)

But it takes more than good families to make a successful school for everybody. The resources are severely lacking. We see in hindsight that our child would have 
benefited from regular interventions with a social worker or school psychologist but neither are these people available at this school nor were the teachers/administration in a position to recognize the need in our child.

My son for the first time ever met the standard math test at his grade level. I think Mr House communicating with me everyday to provide feedback as to how the day was going with my child was very helpful to me on communicating back to my son’s doctors but also helped me find ways on how to improve my son’s behavior in order to help achieve a successful academic year and help him learn. Mr House tries as a team work with the parent to push the child to their fullest potential.

06M052,Anonymous,manhattan,Middle,261,"To be straight to the point,this is the worst middle school I have ever seen.Many fights start inside the school sometimes and even outside in the parking lot.Some kids even smoke marijuana and do extremely bad things to the staff and principals,even the teachers on the last days like baby oil on staircases and fart bombs.The good students are like camouflage for the ghetto students.Teachers sometimes are dramatically disrespectful and may take it like a joke but the students don't.You may find this rare and only if you are well communicated with teachers,like a friend.The school baby's you to wear uniform and if you don't you get your parents called.Seriously?An 8th graders parents called for UNIFORM?Don't even mention the staff.They are always acting like the school is Dominican Republic and playing Spanish music in the cafeteria,which irritates me.They push students around and are annoying.Some students here have been dating and they are in the sixth grade smoking hookah.I have seen MANY pictures.In the cafeteria,we even have separated places,like one side is for students to eat breakfast and one for who isn't .In addition to that,each grade has assigned sections,which is stupid.The reviews here are all lies and I feel absolutely brave and proud of myself that I have survived almost 3 years.Some kids in relationships even bully you that they are in a love relationship and how you're a loner.Also,don't forget the after school program.The after school programs are disrupting and they baby you and give you a horrible experience in there.They also have the same behavior as the school and is annoying.Did I mention the environment after school?The stores are crowded with death-threatening kids telling you to move.The stores are even associated with drugs too.Some people drive there motorcycles and cars letting 8th graders go do drugs with them.Overall,I would give this school a 3 out of 10.The good comments are only from the fake ghetto people that ""fit in"" stating that this is the best school and you will meet amazing people.The only good people here are the teachers.",0,0,0,2015-05-30T02:22:47,1.0,0.467,0.253,0.107,0.924,0.215,0.858,0.0,0.034,0.95,0.008,0.276
06M052,Jocelyn & Juliette,manhattan,Middle,261,"Dear Anonymous,
Not to be rude since this is your opinion,students personal life such as their agreement to participate in drug use has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the school itself. It comes from your conciseness and being told  that doing drugs is ok, not that we do drugs or support its use.In case you didnt realize there are 2 other schools there so the drug user will be hard to detect.  Being separated in the cafeteria is a form of organization and helps ensure that each kid in every grade is served lunch. Being separated  during breakfast helps make cleaning up for the high schools and lunch easier.Students that get to breakfast and don't eat in the morning can catch up with  work.The music during lunch is not put on everyday and was requested by students.Love life, another irrelevant subject linked to the school. If you pay attention to the love life of students then you are not mature enough to state the facts on what you think the school  is actually like. After schools try there best and push us forward to learn academic skills and social skills  we need in life. The environment after school plants trees and flowers within the community and help students value the importance of keeping the environment safe. Uniform help prevents judgement within the students and by enforcing the rules no judgmental comments would be made.The stores, another once again  irrelevant topic to support your claim on the school. Students are meant to control their behavior AT SCHOOL!  What they do outside of school is their business  and does not support the claim that the school is a bad one. As to the teachers, since you are anonymous  call out the teachers. Also as for the senior prank that was a one time thing and the students responsible for it have taken their consequence as of last year.  Finally if you behind the screen took the  time to analyze important things at school such as academic scores and or events happening like honor roll society then you would realize the school may not be the best but it is certainly not the worst. I mean how would you know?This is the only  middle school you have attended.  PS. ghetto  does not classify you as someone who does drugs, gets into fights or is not ''smart''.

06M052,obeserver,manhattan,Middle,261,"I was a student in this school my critiques are that they are handfull of teachers that are wonderful that provide great learning experiences  but, they are some that should not be in this school because, they don't provide a quality education more like a free period, also the crackdown of cutting teachers is somewhat harmful to the school they were some great teachers that just teach anymore, while some i'm glad they are gone because they were not fit to be a teacher. The school lacks structure in kids bullying goes along in the halls unoticed until a student cries and we make a big crisis out of this. Also, the kids are ruining the reputation i might say they really bright kids that they go high in life but, some rather be dreaming to be the next rapper that influence kids these day and age to drugs, profanity, and ect.  The classes are divided into sections of how smart you are which is fair for my opinion because the top classes are for students who are willing to learn and others my view as an unequal oppurtinuty  but, why mix if their not willing to learn or they rather be skipping class. You get what im saying? The staff is really caring but kids dont really appreciate it what i mean by posting  on facebook saying how much they hate the school.  If your looking into this school for your child i reccomend a tour to get the feel of the enviroment. Also. good arts program if your child is an artsy type. AN overall rating i will give 6.5 out of 10 an average rating maybe leaning towards a 7",3,0,0,2012-03-02T02:21:20,1.0,0.467,0.253,0.107,0.924,0.215,0.858,0.0,0.034,0.95,0.008,0.276

I had great teachers Mrs. Rivera(3rd grade), Mr. Steve (k), Ms. Guerra (2nd grade), Mrs. Monserrat (1st grade) and Mr. Lamor (4th grade) were stern but were great nonetheless. Mr. Shapiro the principal was also very nice and charismatic. My kids on the other hand my now 17 yrs old and 8 yr old have had very bad experiences. Most of the teachers then and now are horrible and lazy (that's 85%) of them while the other 15% excels to provide excellence. When my 17 yr old was 8ys old  the teacher she had couldn't stand him and I almost beat her. So they changed his class to Mrs. Martinez (which) is still there and she said the contrary, she also said he just needed a little bit more help. I also got him evaluated and found out that due to that he had a high level of anxiety and ADHD. Now fast forward 10 yrs later my 2nd son is in the same school, going through the same thing. He's also getting left back just like it happened 10yrs ago. I was lucky back then the school was in need of improvement and my son got transferred out. This time they aren't and I have been trying for a whole year to transfer him out and I can't. The last draw was getting my son evaluated because he's very distracted and hyperactive. Maybe now I will get him transfer out that hell hole. But before his IEP got done I had to call the district and speak to the child and family advocate cause I was told that ""They were to busy and backed up to do his IEP evaluation.""

The best teacher that this school had a dual language teacher at that was forced to quit because of his numerous attempts to have a bully in his class removed.  It took for the bully to break another students nose and push the teacher down the stairs in order for the principal to actually pay attention to the problem and even then she did not report it.  She is such a big problem that the dean quit because she would cover up for whom was scratching her back and not do the right thing which is follow the rules and regulations.  How do you enforce to students the rules and regulations, the do the right things if you yourself have no respect for it.  This school is falling apart. She even manipulates the Parents Association. This school needs new administration.

Even so, no one deserves to be treated the way the teachers at PS 132 treat the children. The way these kids are verbally bullied can cause a real social and possibly psycical threat.

They complained for a while and I told them not to worry about it. The principal said they would talk to the kids about it, and she said she would do something about it but this never happened. The principal and staff in Hamilton Heights are much more supporting and caring than the ones at ps 153. Additionally, my child came home always asking for help with their homework, and sadly I could not help them as I am a single mom who did not finish college.

06M153,Anonymous,manhattan,Elementary,492,"This review is outdated. The school is on a steep decline. At least six teachers have left the school this year alone due to stress, lack of support, harassment and lack of physical and emotional safety. Morale is INCREDIBLY low. When I visited, I saw teachers literally crying in front of students. I saw them being berated, scolded and micromanaged in front of their classes. Teachers were NOT willing to tell me personally that they were having a rough time, but they weren't able to tell me that they were full of joy. 

Each of the programs highlighted in the review has become diluted to the point of becoming meaningless. There is no PEACEBUILDERS' program any more, there is no LIBRARY!!!, no Arts Intensive Institute, no art teacher, and due to the high attrition rate, cluster teachers are covering classes and students are missing out on the few arts and enrichments that are left. There are no current partnerships with HSA or other cultural institutions, as far as I could see. 

The political climate at this school has become so divisive and nasty that the children are the last thing on administration's minds. Three false arrests for the person questioning (albeit poorly worded queries) misallocated funds? 

Teachers and parents are fearful for their positions and scared that the retaliation will affect their children. Parents are concerned about class size, school safety, teacher support and wellness, and high stakes testing. There is no tutoring, no disciplinary system to speak of, and the teachers are within a wide range of emotional stress and burnout. They clearly love and care about the students but cannot give them what they need in this climate of data walls and the curriculum that doesn't seem to be developmentally appropriate for any but the highest achievers. 

There seems to be some seriously shady business. Questions are evaded. Parents aren't allowed in the classrooms unless there's a scheduled event taking place like a publishing party. I am used to an open door policy in which parents are welcomed in to the classroom at any time for volunteering or special projects, and teachers I've talked to seem eager for the support and community building as well. 

All in all, I think the teachers at 153 are doing their best with the constraints put on them, but I wouldn't send my kid there.",10,2,0,2014-03-26T16:45:35,1.0,0.33299999999999996,0.161,0.043,0.9009999999999999,0.252,0.825,0.024,0.171,0.76,0.037000000000000005,0.248

I know many of you are in

 that our previously not-so-hot neighborhood school, PS 173, has a new 
principal as of this year who is WONDERFUL and really wants to turn the 
school around. I toured the school a few weeks ago and was blown away by
 the space. Huge, bright, very well stocked classrooms, with very nice, 
clean furnishings and equipment...the principal is rumored to have a 
Montessori background although I can't confirm that. I spoke at great 
length with her personally after my tour and she has a fantastic, 
energetic, and warm energy about her...she desperately wants to get an 
active PTA going, and to get more community parents to consider the 
school for their children to encourage diversity as they turn things 
around. I am putting it very high on our list, because I really would 
love to support my neighborhood school in their efforts to improve...and
 the space really is second to none. I was shocked. The music room 
alone has towering ceilings, and gigantic picture windows with a million
 dollar view of the GW bridge. :) 
Anyway,
 just wanted to spread the word in hopes that others will consider it as
 well! The best shot they have is getting more of us parents involved!

06M187,Ruth Lilienstein-Gatton,manhattan,K-8,757,"Since Inside Schools still has my comment from 7 yrs. ago on this posting I guess I can feel uninhibited in offering an update, with two kids now graduated from 187.  Shawn: Your stats on spec. hs. applications are wrong.  There are NOT fewer kids from 187 applying to specialized high schools and high schools of choice, there are more.  This year's graduating class actually has four acceptances at HSMSE at City College, six at La Guardia, one at Bklyn Tech, 5 going to Beacon, with one turning it down in favor of full scholarship to Berkshire Boarding School, one to NEST, two or three to Museum School, and, as stated below, by one of my fellow parents, others to NYC iSchool, Frank McCourt, and Hunter College Math & Science, to name a few.  Within this same group of students, who started in the same kindergarten year, seven left for Columbia Secondary School after fifth grade, and four left for Hunter High after 6th grade.  Those are also specialized high schools.  You do the math.  How many other schools of comparable size, with an 8th grade that includes a special education class and large number of ELLs have stats like that?  
 
Moreover, and I say this less with pride than with practicality:  the biggest factor in my sons' acceptances to LaGuardia and Beacon High Schools were their parents' level of involvement.  Private music lessons for five years were essential, as were the tutor I hired for one son in 7th grade math.  Without it he wouldn't have made Beacon.  This is no different than it would be in any other middle school in the city of New York so disabuse yourself of that notion right now, if you're set on the specialized high school path for your child.  Parental input, from day one, is the biggest predictor of educational success, almost everything else being equal.
 
The discussions below are, once again, covering too many different threads.  Discipline issues have always been a topic of dispute at 187.  Some teachers at 187 seem to follow an authoritarian model that some parents feel is set by the administration.  Some of those authoritarian teachers are excellent instructors at the same time they are loud and demanding. Others are loud and not as good at teaching--or can only teach a certain type of learner well.  There are intermediate school teachers who are very lax and friendly.  There are elementary school teachers who are innovative and creative.  There are others who are very traditional in their approach.  Each of them reaches different children differently and any parent will tell you that.
 
Parents who dislike the quiet lunches or the silent passings in the hallway, and who have the means to find alternative schools to choose from, do so.  I don't see that aspect of school life heavily affecting the child's academic success, unless there is extreme unhappiness on the part of the child.  The public school system is wrought with variety in the methods of classroom management and teaching methods used, in every school, and in every classroom.  
 
In terms of actual effect, the administration can do just so much.  In 187, where one hears that discipine is tight, there are individual students who have behavioral problems so acute that they disrupt the functioning of the school in its entirety.  The administration's hands are tied on how to deal with these problems, as they are in many schools of different types.  Only private schools can eject students for their behavior.  In my nine year experience at 187, on balance, I've found it has been easier for the school to remove a problem teacher than a problem student.  Several teachers were moved out of the classroom during my time.  No problematic students were.  
 
And I dispute the assertion that there are no problem students.  Public schools are the one mandatory gathering place for all of our society's young people--the indigent, the troubled, the homeless, the disabled, the gifted, the recently emigrated, the parentless, the abused--all the ones that the private system safely excludes.  Can there be a system that smoothly and satisfactorily educates all these children to the same level of competence?  Is there enough money in the world to do it right?
 
187 does not suffer from any more or fewer difficulties than any other similar elementary or middle school.  There are less competent teachers everywhere and to brand them all ""excellent"" is as simple-minded as branding them all tyrants.  The only thing parents can do, in this horribly underfunded, overcrowded public educational climate, is fight battles on the most basic classroom level, for their own children, while trying their best to support systemic changes within a school that are realistic, democratic, fair, and thoughtful.  Fortunately, 187 has a lot of parents who are doing just that.

Many parents keep their kids away from Latino kids, even when their kids choose them naturally as friends. They may invite them to a birthday party or one time party at their home, but they try really hard, and many times in a mean way to keep their children separated in an everyday basis. Is a double moral behavior that really hurts all kids (wake up, your children are also hurting, they don't even know how to behave when they meet in the street) Personally, I decided to take my child away before more serious emotional hurt can be done. Others advised me not to choose the school when I mention it to them. Academically is the best school in the area, and one feels incline to ignore the problem, but this may be a huge mistake in the long run. And this is supposed to be a community with enough social and cultural knowledge to understand diversity. Good luck if the school keeps ignoring this and thinking that translating their formal parent association documents will ""solve"" the issue. One kid told his mother once that he wanted to have her skin tone, so the music teacher may treat him better.

Many of the people that were in my PS.189 that I reached out to are now Lawyers, Surgeons, technicians, Artists, policemen/women some also do simpler jobs that they’ve always wanted to do such as nail and hair salon owners and employees. So no people who go to this school don’t end up in a bad place it all comes down to how serious the person takes their work and the amazing experiences the staffs try to give their students.",0,0,0,2019-06-20T01:49:03,1.0,0.27,0.215,0.08,0.899,0.171,0.813,0.006,0.015,0.9420000000000001,0.037000000000000005,0.252

06M189,Harly J. Rodriguez,manhattan,Elementary,674,"I think that all that was said in that video is very true about the school. I got the chance to attend P.S. 189M (wow just remembered how i used to write this every morning on my heading haha) and it was the best public school experience/education (later on my mom would put me in catholic school) I ever had. I was also a part of NDI and this program does work wonders for students. The interaction that we had with each other and the idea that we all were working for a common goal, which was to have fun & also impress our parents, teachers & fellow peers when we got to perform at laguardia high school at the end of the year, really built a feeling of companionship. NDI really got me to break out of my shell and I felt like i benefitted from it tremendously. Prior to 4th grade my mother had my twin brother and I attending a school in the bronx where we were beginning to perform under par academically. When getting to this school in 4th grade my brother and I excelled because of the great teachers and staff and also the emphasis they had for the arts. My brother and I loved drawing so it was a great fit.

I hope I am not making this school sound so much like an art school because it really is not but compared to others it really raises the bar for the arts. I stressed on talking about NDI because it had a positive influence in me as a student. Teachers here were committed to their students and loved having a positive influence in them unlike other public schools I had been in back in the Bronx. One teacher in particular was my 4th grade teacher Ms. Thomas who treated all of her students as if we were her sons in daughters. She got to know us on a personal level and really brought out the best in us. If there are any parents reading this in hoping to sign up your kids at 189 I recommend they encourage their kids to take advantage of all the extracurricular opportunities they have at the school like joining the band or orchestra (my brother and i were in the band i was taught how to play the trumpet and he the clarinet by Mr. Palmer :-)) because being a part of these programs and activities made school more appealing for me. When attending P.S. 189 M school was no longer a boring and stressful demand for me anymore, instead it was a place where I would look forward to coming back to after each weekend.

I am now going to be a senior at Syracuse University double majoring in Neuroscience & Psychology. I leave my email here in hopes that I can get in contact with any teachers or fellow peers who remember me haha.

We received the acceptance letter and I gave a call to the school on 2 occasions to ask general questions and I was given a cold response. I didn't even get a good morning back or a your welcome on my thank you. 

I still decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and went to the school to visit. I walked into the office and was not greeted and when I told her I was here to register the woman did not even look up. She said come back on a later date. 
On my 2nd visit, the security guard said they stopped registering for the day. I didn't understand because they said up to 11am and it was only 9:30am. I was allowed to call up to the office to ask if it was possible to be seen being that she said 11am and she ""no, I have tons of things to do and do not have time for pre-k registration."" I asked her than what the schedule was and she said ""whatever the paper (D.O.E. acceptance letter) says."" The letter only says the dates of registration. She said to come back the next day at 8am. I told her I have an older child whom was graduating from another school and I couldn't do that time and she said ""IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.'

Only three schools were selected in the category and we were the lone middle school in the entire City! Collaborative Problem Solving, a restorative approach that we use as an alternative to detention and suspension, will be the primary component of our work that we showcase when other schools visit next year.

And in even bigger news... A couple of weeks ago New York State released it's accountability measurements for each school in the State, all 4,771 of them (the five boroughs account for about 1,700 of those schools). This is arguably the most important ranking that any school is subjected to because these rankings, based on a school's annual progress and using State Exam scores disaggregated by subgroups (students with disabilities, black, hispanic, English language learners, economically disadvantaged, etc.) are what determines which schools are making adequate progress and will avoid state intervention, which are not making adequate progress and will come under state control, and which schools the state will close. A small number of schools will even be identified as ""reward schools"" across two categories, ""Performance"" and ""Progress,"" and will be used as models for other schools throughout the state to replicate because of their success. Those honored for Performance are more numerous than those honored for Progress, precisely because it is so difficult to make giant gains in progress, and easier to keep performing well when you have a cohort of students already scoring at levels 3 and 4 on the State exams. Whether recognized for Performance or Progress, these schools will be eligible for approximately $75,000 in grant monies to lead this work across the state. 

I've never dreamt that we would be honored as a reward school - in fact, I had no idea there was such a thing before this year, but we did it! I don't think I can convey exactly how exclusive this club is any better than if I just lay out the numbers:

4,771: Schools in NYS (public and charter)
1,700: Schools in NYC  
185: Schools statewide that met the requirements to be honored as Reward Schools in New York State
10: Schools statewide that met the requirements to be honored as a Reward School for Progress in New York State (the other 175 schools were honored for Performance)
2: Schools from the NYC DOE honored as Reward Schools for Progress
1: Middle Schools (grades 6 - 8) in ALL OF NYS to be honored for Progress

That one middle school, is ours. We are literally one of two schools in the City, Elementary and High Schools included, that made the gains necessary to be honored by the State. But even more impressive, WE WERE THE ONLY MIDDLE SCHOOL (6th - 8th grade) IN NEW YORK STATE THAT MADE LARGE ENOUGH GAINS TO BE HONORED AS A PROGRESS SCHOOL.

Of course we are dealing with human beings, not androids and at a certain moment a teacher may say something that you as a parent might not want to hear, perhaps it is due to your lack of emotional intelligence or is it because you are in a deep denial set of mind when it comes to your child’s behavioral issues.  Or could this be because the administration did not react according to your expectations or what you thought was the right thing to do?

 It is shameful that you would describe Mrs. Linares and Camilo in such an inhumane way and as irresponsible individuals.

Mrs. Linares and Mr. Camilo are human beings blessed with patience, knowledge, experience, love, kindness and more than anything high moral values.  I can testify before anyone of the work and effort that these two people put in their school and how much they do for their students. Saying that they are unprofessional is nothing but absurd, as absurd as to dare to say that in a school office, staff does not know where “School Records"" are? And as well as stating that 90% of the parents have complaints about the school and staff. Do you really know 90% of P.S. 210 parents?

Obviously you did not have a pleasant experience, since things were not resolved the way you wanted or expected to. But one thing I need to say to you is that as responsible parents, we need to accept when our children are in need of desperate help. It is obvious that you are very upset and the things that you are saying here make no sense and are said out of pure anger. I believe it is more beneficial for us as parents to try to find the help our children really need, instead of trying to find who to blame for our children’s behavioral and emotional issues.

Many of the students show little to no respect for each other, and the staff isn't much better either. The students were often rude and disrespectful to each other and showed little care for the work. Other students like myself who actually wanted to be there would often get lumped in with the rest of the class as the teachers were very fond of group punishment. Very frequently it would only be a handful of students who were misbehaving, but the teachers would just hand out a whole classroom detention during lunch. The staff would use any excuse to take away a students lunch period, from frankly BS class detentions to putting someone aside because there was a tiny amount of white on their 95% black sneakers. Many of the teachers loved to scream at the students for ten to twenty minutes, and would frequently hold up the class over the most menial things. The dean in particular actually wore out her vocal cords because she would scream so much during the lunch period, and was so loud that I could hear her fits from the floor below. 

The environment here is very toxic and doesn't encourage learning in the slightest.

In sixth grade, you are learning on a seventh grade scale, seventh grade on an eighth grade scale, and eighth graders, on a ninth grade scale. For some children, this is two fast paced. In sixth grade, we kind of skipped the basics, so I fell back a bit. The key to achieving in Mott Hall is too stay organized, keep color coded notebooks, and sections in your binders, and have a good format for taking notes and studying. The other key element is doing you're homework. Yeah, its hard, but deal with it. If you start your year not doing any homework, you will not do well. Some things that need to be improved in this school is some of the faculty problems, some teachers do not respect the students. In one instance, a certain teacher, who I wrote a letter in french for (one of our assignments), called it trash, and gave back everyones papers calling them disgraceful. Also we have a small gym, and small classrooms. A lot of times it is either WAY too hot, or WAY to cold in the classrooms. Another downside is that the special ed kids run around the halls and banging on doors and screaming in the staircases. I am a current eighth grader at Mott Hall and going through the high school process, and I have to say that the guidance counseler and teachers are really helpful and supportive in helping you in any way. When I graduate, I will be very sad too leave, and miss everything. If you are thinking about going to this school, you will have a great experience. It will be tough at times, but when you get through them, it will be great.",0,0,0,2014-11-09T17:12:17,0.75,0.023,0.14300000000000002,0.04,0.747,0.09,0.603,0.027000000000000003,0.08,0.81,0.063,0.106

06M223,Unknown,manhattan,Middle,300,"The Mott Hall School is quite the advanced academic school in the city of New York. But this school has some flaws and some goods. 

The Good

1. Above average standards for this school.

The Curriculum provided is considered above the BOE's standards, and we are considered a gifted and talented school.

2. Teachers, teachers, teachers,

While they may be a nuisance at times, the Teachers are nice (mostly) and they provide guidance to students if needed. Some honorable mentions I like to make are teachers like Ms.Torres, Ms.Whyman, Ms.Boros, Mr.Fernandez, Ms.Burke, and Mr.Vigrass. I personally think these teachers are the building blocks of the school. (Unlike there more superior counterparts) *cough the assistant principal and principal cough*

3. Somewhat extracurricular activities.

6th graders are offered the choice of 5 activities they can do twice a week during 8th period.Activities rotate every 3 months.1 is the most preferred and 5 is the least. I believe the 5 are rotational chess, permanent chess (6 months, god knows what they were thinking when naming that), stock market, collage and film producing. Speaking of chess, there is a club that goes from 2-4 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. They go to junior nationals every year and have free snacks during their sessions. 

4. The Chess Club

A follow up to the chess club, they raise the funds by selling chocolates for $1. After nationals, no more. Pretty sure the school's budget funds part of the trip, but kids who wish to go must pay their airfare ticket or whatever. Usually $150-$250.

The Bad

1. The small space disadvantage.

Space is limited, especially since there is no auditorium and gym. Also the gym teacher Ms.Molina teaches most her lessons in the yard, she locks the equipment when it is not appropriately used (reasonable), and lastly she seems nice inside, but is a real pitbull when you pull her trigger. Additionally we have to walk to another school (mainly A.Philip Randolph and P.S. 129) to have things like ceremonies, ndi performances, and general announcements. 

2. The true ""call of the wild""

The special ed kids are mostly bad. They are loud, bang on the doors of teachers during instructing in classes, and they are most responsible for the lockup of sports equipment at recess. 

3. The bathroom battle
The situation is considered bad because with the girls bathroom, girls would be texting and using their cell phones and the boys bathroom is usually trashed.

4. THE LOCKER SITUATION

Oh the horror of this situation i'm about to present.

Indeed, since there isn't enough spacing provided in the building we are forced to share lockers. Sounds reasonable? Wrong, because a locker is shared with 4 people in a cramped spacing. It is considered hallway horror when the 7th and 8th graders make there daily rounds in their lockers.

5. No sports clubs (pretty self explanatory)

6. The french teacher is mean and annoying. Only god knows why that old bag ended up teaching here. She deserves to teach in one of those really bad schools. Maybe that's why we're here.

7. Fighting and the common use of profanity.

There would be fighting once in a while and there would be general disruption and unrest. Meanwhile profanity would be commonly used, but teachers let it slide.

The Verdict

While this school has one of the best academic standards in the city of New York, leadership and a serious staff should put fixing this school as a first priority. This school doesn't have all the potential it used to have 29 years ago. Now if you ask me, we can either fix this as a community or let it all go down the drain. An okay school in general, but it really needs to shape up.",3,0,0,2014-09-02T09:21:10,0.75,0.023,0.14300000000000002,0.04,0.747,0.09,0.603,0.027000000000000003,0.08,0.81,0.063,0.106

The comments you see opposing this school are students who have attended YEARS  ago, I cannot stress this enough, YEARS AGO!

If they're complaining this much then that means that their generation was bad and are judging the future ones upon theirs. It's only been a couple of months since i graduated and I can re-assure you that the teachers are very nice ( I can't say much about the new ones).

Also, yes, unfortunately when I attended my senior year as an 8th grader, the 7th graders were really an interesting group, since they caused the most trouble, a troublesome year really. 

But I am sure that the teachers will set them straight, Especially the assistant principle Ms.Thai who I can say is a really great person but can be strict which is what makers her special! Also, Mr.Fernandez who is an amazing, truly amazing person (past years will know ;D) will speak to them about their behavior.

This school is really amazing and life-changing. My former class year had the most students accepted into specialized high schools than any other year in Mott Hall.

My best friend/ first friend at mott hall was accepted into a catholic school with FULL SCHOLARSHIP, others have been accepted into boarding schools like andover and many others. Two of my friends go to Stuyvesant which is hard to get into, a group got into Brooklyn Tech including my best friend, another group into Bronx Science , Lehman, City College, and others.

06M278,iSkyscraper,manhattan,K-8,551,"When we first started thinking about schools several years ago we didn't even know 278 existed.    But lo and behold here was this rising, well-respected school right in our area, and we chose it over several other options.  We've been very happy with our experience so far. 


The school is now quite popular in its zone (one of the only schools in all of Upper Manhattan to have a waitlist) and for good reason.  Wonderful teachers, attentive administration, diverse programs including plenty of art and music.  The shared cafeteria and gym with PS 18 do present some challenges but the combination of the two schools also works positively for things like the alternate ""wellness in the schools"" menu and the unusually good auditorium (complete with stage and theatre lighting). 

If you are considering attending here and want to learn more than you've seen on the school tour or on the DOE website, don't sit on 219th or 220th St and focus on the industrial surroundings and bare schoolyard.  (The outside of the school is admittedly less attractive than many.)  You won't see any of the kids on those blocks outside of school hours.  The actual heart of the school on evenings and weekends is Isham Park, which is in the middle of the school's zone and where many of the students play off-hours.  (Second local hang-out for spotting 278 kids -- the top-notch Indian Road Playground in Inwood Hill Park).  Given that much of the school year is in winter or rainy weather, the plain yard is less of an issue than you might think during the school day and the spacious and well maintained inside of the school is very much up to par.

Being at a zoned school certainly has its advantages when you consider the minimal ""commute"" (walking 10 minutes instead of a long bus ride)  and the fact that you run into schoolmates everywhere in the neighborhood.   Afterschool options are many (at the school, at the Y, at Bread & Yoga all very popular) and also in the neighborhood. 

The school does have traditional elements like homework and uniforms, but if you like that sort of thing you will be very pleased.  Our child seems to be doing well academically and we're looking forward to next year.",0,0,0,2014-04-28T05:01:12,0.75,0.149,0.207,0.028999999999999998,0.63,0.098,0.505,0.025,0.025,0.768,0.16,0.154

It would have been great if, in visiting, you also took the opportunity to talk to the teachers about what makes our school special, as we take a lot of pride in our work and our students, and this is evident in our school, the students who love going here, and the number of alumni who continue to visit us even throughout college to let us know how they are doing.

While you have made remarks about our ""progressiveness"" and some lack there-of, please note also that we are a Department of Education public school, not a charter school, and therefore are required to mold our educational practices around their expectations and guidelines. We are an A school, we have primarily been an A school, and a School in Good Standing since we have opened, and that is due to our educational practices, which earned us a high proficient mark on our Quality Review in 2011-12.The remarks you made regarding our high school selection process were a little offensive - truthfully, all of us who work with the 8th graders take much time and care in helping them select high schools, and find the best schools possible. You were also incorrect about the specialized high schools, we have had 3 students at LaGuardia, and another just got into City College high school this past year. I have 8th graders enter into Fashion Industries and Art and Design High School every year - while these are not ""specialized"", these are audition schools, and indicate the level of talent and dedication of our students - and their teachers. In general our students have attended a lot of wonderful high schools in the city - the specialized high schools are not the only good schools that exist, and are often over-crowded and do not allow for more intensive one-on-one attention that other schools do.You should also be specific about the population that we serve, as one of our amazing features is our cultural diversity, and our attitude towards celebrating all cultures' unique features. We have only grown more diverse since our last visit, and it is something that all of us at PS/MS 278 embrace and value.Our parent participation has much evolved since your visit in either our 2nd or 3rd year of opening (as we opened in 2004, also not noted in your review), our PTA is a super active presence in our school. They have done an amazing amount of fund-raising in the past 4 years, are now incorporated as a non-profit, and make an effort to make every year better than the last.",4,0,0,2012-10-16T11:17:39,0.75,0.149,0.207,0.028999999999999998,0.63,0.098,0.505,0.025,0.025,0.768,0.16,0.154

What's special:  The school doesn't have opera and ballroom dancing, but does have an amazing arts program.  This includes an intensive music program and dance program in the lower grades (via grants for ""Music & the Brain"", a room of 25 piano keyboards for lower grades and instruments for orchestra and band for higher grades, as well as a collaboration with the 92nd Street Y).   For the upper grades, the debate program does well.  The school also offers Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM) which clusters students across grade levels by topics of interest.

The downside:  small play yard and gym


When looking for a school for my son (now a first grader), I looked at the standard schools of choice (lottery) in District 6 (Amistad, Hamilton Heights, Muscota, and Washington Heights) as well as PS 278 (one of our zoned schools).  PS 278 stood out for its emphasis on standards and how happy faculty and parents were with the principal.  It is not a parent-run school, but the principal has an open-door policy and focuses on solving problems.  The student body is not as affluent as that of the schools of choice, but the school does well with getting grants to provide extra funding.   Parental involvement has increased in the last couple of years (see the PTA website at:  http://www.psms278.org/).",1,0,0,2012-02-24T15:58:11,0.75,0.149,0.207,0.028999999999999998,0.63,0.098,0.505,0.025,0.025,0.768,0.16,0.154

06M293,canis domum,manhattan,Middle,262,"The expectations of this school are frighteningly low. Scores are routinely boosted and answers to tests posted in advance; some teachers don't grade or look at the student's work, others seem to look and then, if the score is too low, arbitrarily assign higher grades, if not outright falsify. Perhaps this is for fear of deleterious consequences for themselves -- the outcome is the same. There is a percentage of high school kids who read and write on the third or fourth grade level, at best, yet receive 90s in ELA. Ditto for math, where they are far behind other kids and schools. Plagiarism is accepted, and perhaps encouraged. The grammar spoken and written by some of the teachers is atrocious. State tests? Who knows! It's hard to believe the posted scores, and makes one wonder if tests aren't altered. The administration and Ms. Drysdale cast a blind eye towards these 'anomalies'. What, exactly, is CCAA preparing these kids for? If the spelling and grammar of the comments from those who have graduated is an indication, certainly not college or the real world.

06M293,Alumni Searching For Clarity,manhattan,Middle,262,"As graduates, (and being in the school for middle and high school), one of the main problems that need to be addressed is professionalism with relationships. (The principal) clearly has a couple of students that she gives perks to, whether or not they deserve it. There have been several occasions in which students who do bad things are not penalized when reported just because the faculty likes said student. In addition, her priorities are all over the place; (uniform enforcement above organization in general) 

 the ASSISTANT PRINCIPLES,  have very tight schedules and do not give student the time and consideration that is needed for classes, tutoring, and etc.. They want us to do better (which is appreciated), yet they do not provide assistance in it. The assistant principles and the main principal need to have better communication within themselves. 

{as for the} COUNSELOR mostly involved with the upperclassmen, it's very hard to say that she helps students in difficult situations. She belittles, doesn't provide answers, is quite impatient/misunderstanding, and victimizes the people when they come to her for help. Although she is supportive in some situations, its pretty easy to say that she forces her opinions on people (she doesn't hold back in telling you that the decisions you are making for your future are wrong, in her opinion).

Moving on to the TEACHERS, they definitely care about the students, although it must be said that some are biased leaning towards their favorites.

The teachers don't discipline the students that need to be disciplined; for example, if a student is doing or saying something inappropriate towards another student, and said student ""tattle tells"", teachers will and have said ""nobody likes a tattle tale.""

The STUDENTS: the middle school and high school have different issues that need to be addressed. First, middle school and high school are two very different things and experiences, therefore, they should be kept separate. 

MIDDLE SCHOOLERS are young, vulnerable, and naive. Times are changing, and so are the kids. Some are meaner, some are maturing way earlier, and the rules need to be better enforced to make sure that no kid is belittled and ridiculed by other kids. It's impossible to stop it all, but it can definitely be controlled and reduced by a landslide.

As for HIGH SCHOOL, kids are more mature and they need to be better informed on general knowledge. For example, health classes need to be taken more seriously.It is important that young adults are informed of risks, illnesses, and alternatives that life has to offer in a general sense. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are things that need to be thoroughly addressed.

In addition, high schoolers influence the middle schoolers tremendously.... Cursing, fighting, bullying, and etc is different for middle school and high school. There should be different rules for both, but due to the lack of our own building, there is no space, time, or separation between the different grades. There are territorial issues between the THREE SCHOOLS. I repeat, THREE SCHOOLS in one 5-floor building, of which we only own 1 and a half for over 500 students in just 1 of the schools. No one has enough attitude or authority to fight for the space that is rightfully ours at certain times, and within requested scheduling.

Overall, things just need to be more professional.

Last but not least, the general SCHOOL is not diverse, nor united. There are little to no activities (dances, assemblies, clubs, sports). The school is still trying to bear its ground, but at almost a decade old, it's safe to say that things are moving way too slow. It's time to develop good structure, good organization, and fix the school overall.

Despite all the REALISM (or what you might consider negativity), it must be said that the academics are really great. Generally, students get the help they need, and the program really makes sure no one gets left behind in education. Looking at the big picture concerning education, the curriculum is great.",0,0,0,2014-08-16T18:38:50,0.75,0.08800000000000001,0.156,0.004,0.821,0.126,0.718,0.008,0.027000000000000003,0.9470000000000001,0.015,0.107

not. how cool would it be to receive your bachelors degree at 20 years

actually classes at the college , its amazing, you take morning classes 
at the high school then half way through out the day you get to leave 
eat lunch and then go take classes on 137th and amsterdam. the only way 
to keep going to the college is by keeping good grades. once you get to 
11th grade you go to the college in the morning and take about one or 
two classes at the high school in the afternoon. once you become a 
senior, you take classes all day at the college, leave early , take two -
 three classes a day. its cool. if you go to the highschool in your

I find that it is hard to understand the teachings because individual tutring cannaot be done. not only did i have no idea what i was doing my grades dropped big time and i used to be a star student before i came here. The teachers all vary with their attention to students. not only did they blame the fault on the students but expectations of doing well was to be seen even not knowing anything. I also think that the students should not be offerd college courses. does it make sense? Not all children have the minds to learn such complicated material at such a young age. the students put an air of confidence and arrogance because they think they are smarter than other kids and more advanced than others because of these s called college courses they take but there are other schools which are much better program like I.S. 52 alpha program and also Motthall which is the pride of the District 6 education program and since CCAA is so great why does motthall and I.S.52 top them? and they are so advanced to take college classes well i wonder why they are so third rate? thats all i wanna say for now.,0,0,0,2012-09-22T02:24:54,0.75,0.08800000000000001,0.156,0.004,0.821,0.126,0.718,0.008,0.027000000000000003,0.9470000000000001,0.015,0.107
06M293,gangasimply,manhattan,Middle,262,"It is interesting to see the growth of the school, but very sad, having observed the school for a long time and knowing students and staff personally, that the school was never intended to be in the IS 218 building longer than one year.  In addition, many students never receive special education services, ESL services, and the lack of organization is giving students a lesser education.  While CCAA obviously shines above the rest of the schools in the area, by a long shot, it looses many of its best and brightest in 8th grade to better high schools.  In addition, its staff turnover is a huge indicator that, though the school has great potential, it does not have the infrastructure to support a core of teachers whom want to stay for the long term.  Any successful school (and there are many) has a core of teachers (at least 60%) who stay every year because they feel that they are able to make a difference, that their curriculum ideas are valued (not imposed) and that students who wish to take college courses are guided properly in that direction with excellent instruction.  The school has been in existence for eight years and for a parent, these are now a non-negotiable:
1. a building that houses only the school (this is Washington Heights, not midtown, we have room to either occupy an existing space or build!)
2. a website which properly advertises whom the staff are, what they teach, what the school schedule is and how we can get involved with upcoming trips, events, etc...
3. a tutoring program which is also advertised on said website
4. students whom are behavior problems are taken care of, or asked to leave, they aren't kept on because of the financial gain they will bring.  If this is a great school there should be a waiting list and it should be utilized
5. A diverse student population must be recruited, but in order for that to happen organization and administrative know-how must be evident.  Simply stating that students are going to receive up to 60 college credits is not enough to have a diverse student population willing to commute long distances, students need to feel that the school has a culture of success, cooperation and has cast off the ghetto feel of many of the surrounding public schools
6. Parents need to feel that they can contribute to their child's education as a partner, but this cannot happen if a school that is supposed to deliver so much is still set-up as a half-way house and disorganized.

It is a very small school with two classes per grade. The middle school and elementary school are separate and rarely have contact, unless there's something concerning the whole school. Almost everyone in my year are like my second family, most of us have known each other since kindergarten. Me on the other hand, I came to the school in 4th grade after a very tough move across the country. It was very hard for me to adjust to this city but with the support of my teachers and friend, who are like my family now, I had a very good first year. The atmosphere of the school is very friendly and everyone is accepted. However there are a few problems one being issues with the speech classes. My younger sister who is currently in 5th grade changed the school because she felt like she wasn't challenged enough. She can't say her 'r's, 'th's and 's's, so when it came time for her to read to improve her reading level the teaches never really changed it because of her speech impediment. Our parents tried to get her speech classes but they never took her because it wasn't directly affecting her grade. But despite all of that I've never really had a problem with the school. There are 3 after school programs in the school, CUNY in the heights, FYI (for MS only), and Little Red Rocket (for elementary only). There's also the BOOST program which is a program for middle school student to go on educational and cultural field trips. There is also a regents class for those who want to take the 8th math regents. I really love my school, my teachers, and friends.

My children have been given frequent tests and pop quizzes, sometimes graded in red ink. And for the coming year, the school will do away with looping except in kindergarten and first grade. The homework load in my kids' and my friends' kids' grades is very heavy, with a strong emphasis on publisher-created worksheets.

As a veteran educator that has witnessed the history of Muscota, I’ve seen it undergo a transition that took them from turmoil to
success.  They were in danger of closing down and change was imminent. Muscota has become more academically rigorous in
recent years but they have maintained their progress values., Teachers pride themselves with holding onto progressive values while meeting the demands of the new common core learning standards. While collaboratively planning, they find interesting ways to make the content more engaging with a real-world application and focus on project based learning.

We are proud that the school outperformed the city without
compromising our values and our belief on how children learn best. I’ve noticed that curriculum has become interdisciplinary, focused on integrating all content areas around big questions. Students engage in inquiry and help develop the guiding questions they are studying. Students have many opportunities to ensure their voice is heard and advocate for themselves. This is evident in our weekly Town Meetings where the whole school community comes together to sing, dance and share our work. Students make announcements in front of the whole school community and help run the Town Meeting. Our Talent Show which is hosted
by the 5th graders is also a great example of students choosing what
they want to showcase and creating original pieces to share with the
community.  

I am honored to be working so closely with my colleagues and
would like to address a comment that was posted about the teaching staff not being diverse. The hiring committee is composed of parents, administration and teachers who all have voices in the hiring of the new staff members. When hiring new staff members, it is a lengthy process to ensure that we find the best candidate for our school.

Hmm, “look elsewhere.” It was not easy to find Muscota, but when I did, I couldn't be happier. Most progressive schools required families to pay tuition to have their child attend. Muscota does not.  My first impression of this school was during a tour. I had spent months researching progressive schools around the city and visited those I thought would be a good fit for my daughter. 

During the tour at Muscota, no matter the classroom I entered, I could hear students engaged in conversations, working independently, or involved in collaborative play. It didn’t have the feel of a traditional school. Students seemed enthusiastic and engaged in their own learning.  There was a warm feeling across the school that I had not seen in other schools I’d visited. I saw evidence of student work products displayed around the room or hanging from lights.  I knew immediately that this was the place I’d want my daughter to attend.

In the end, unquestionably, Muscota was my first choice. The school offered a balance of academics, social and, more importantly a progressive philosophy. 

Since then, my daughter has flourished. She is receiving a well rounded education, that shows her academic as well as her artistic growth.  She is assigned projects based on interest, that we work on at home. She once expressed that she loved her school and didn’t know why anyone would ever want to be absent. The homework she was doing at night prepared her to take state assessments. There was limited evidence that suggested she was being instructed on how to take a test. They read books as a class that engaged my daughter in wanting to read more books by the author. Regardless of what others believe about Muscota’s progressive philosophy, I know that my daughter will be well prepared to meet the demands of the 21st Century.",0,0,1,2015-11-10T19:48:45,1.0,0.061,0.193,0.003,0.41200000000000003,0.027000000000000003,0.247,0.040999999999999995,0.03,0.456,0.409,0.047

06M314,Kate Wilson,manhattan,Elementary,296,"This year one of our daughters graduates from Muscota as the other starts her journey there in kindergarten. That we have another six years at Muscota gives us great comfort, since it feels like a second home. 



I am writing because, between researching elementary schools seven years ago and spending the last two years researching middle schools, I have spent hundreds of hours talking to parents, researching websites, and touring over twenty schools. I am inspired by how parents share information. We are all in the same boat. Every NYC family has to navigate the treacherous waters of school choice. It makes this big city feel like a small town. We should take solace that college admissions will be a breeze compared with finding the right kindergarten for our children. While there is not one right school for all children, once you find the right school for your child, and your family, you will know it. We are so fortunate and grateful that we found the right school for our daughter and for our family, and that it is a seven minute walk from our home. 



We are not yet authorities on middle schools, but we do know Muscota inside and out, because that's the kind of school it is. It WANTS families to know it, engage with it, and grow with it. A school is only as strong as its inhabitants and Muscota is a thriving community of love, learning, and discovery. We wish Muscota could extend to high school because it offers the kind of education that has finally made it to the front covers of every newspaper and teaching journal in the world. It is progressive, rigorous, responsive, diverse, and child-centered. It is WHOLE. 



Muscota has forever shaped the way our daughter sees, investigates, and reflects the world. Some of its trademarks include: 



THE ARTS. At Muscota students learn about the world THROUGH the arts. The arts are not an appendage, but are rather the heart of the school's rigorous and creative collaboration. Sasha teaches sculpture, perspective, self-portrait, architecture, 2D design, and doll/puppet making by connecting each to texts the students are reading, concepts they are grappling with in math and science, and buildings in their neighborhood. In Megan's music class students compose songs about human anatomy and celebrate Mayan, Irish, Chinese, and Dutch culture through songs (sung in their native language). In Heather's dance class students explore world history through gumboot dances, tutting, and solo/partnering choreography. Students start playwriting in kindergarten with Dayna and graduate to fully produced self-written and Shakespearean plays by fifth grade. The students' understanding of character, dialogue, conflict, context, figurative speech, and plot is extraordinary, thanks to drama with Dayna. 



COMMUNITY. Muscota values community. Rituals and traditions are scheduled weekly and monthly to celebrate and extend classroom learning into the entire school and Inwood/Washington Heights community. Events include Monday morning town meeting, Inwood Park hikes, Family Breakfast, Mad Hatter's Ball, Candlelight Night, Winter Ice Skating Trip, State Fair, Talent Show, Pi Day, Eco-Fest, Spring Shakespeare Production, Spring Auction, Field Day, Mini Mall, Fifth Grade Overnight Adventure, Moving On, and Curriculum Nights. Students visit the nearby Bronx Zoo, Botanical Garden, Dyckman Farmhouse, as well as head downtown to the Joyce Theater, Tenement Museum, Juilliard, and the Museum of Natural History. 



PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT. Parental involvement is encouraged and essential to the thriving environment. Parent-led initiatives were behind a playground upgrade, cafeteria overhaul, state of the art auditorium sound system, science program, yoga program, garden plot, and countless other enrichment opportunities. Parents work closely with teachers and the administration. Communication is clear and comprehensive, accomplished through backpacked written correspondence, e-mail, the website, phone and in person through monthly meetings with Principal Camille Wallin and the Parents' Association. Parents are included in their child's learning through conferences with teachers. Evening and weekend workshops include topics such as nutrition, the arts, literacy, science, math, testing, and parenting support.



RIGOR. We love what our daughter comes home with each night. Her homework is challenging and engaging. She reads a novel a week independently, suited to her interests, as well as a novel/non-fiction book a month with her class and yet another in her after-school program. Her math homework keeps our entire family on our toes and entertained. She has learned math concepts through Mancala, Chess, card games, and the Salvadori program. This year her teacher Lauren's Culture of Proof tenet: ""convince yourself, convince a friend, convince a skeptic"" has changed the way we talk at the dinner table and the way I teach in my college classroom. We cherish the looping that Muscota is known for. Students, or ""scholars"" as Principal Camille calls them, stay with each teacher for two years. Muscota's teachers know, honor, respect, and celebrate how each student learns. Recently our daughter's classmate taught the class about rainforest deforestation through an interactive Minecraft presentation. 



The school day spans from 8:30am to 3:10pm and offers early drop off as well as outstanding after-school programs. Partnerships with the nearby Bread & Yoga, Uptown Sports, and Nagle YM&YWHA also provide families with flexibility and enrichment. The school is safe, the kids are safe, and bullying simply does not exist. 



Muscota is responsible, in great part, for how our daughter thinks, problem solves, communicates with friends and family, and engages with the world.

NYC Parent

I took many tours as I was searching for a school that was a right fit for my child. Believe me when I say no two schools were alike.

If you are looking at this, then you probably have done your homework and know that Muscota is not a traditional school. 

Confidence, Self Assuredness and Strength of Character are elements of a Muscota child. Where else would a strange parent visiting a child's second home be greeted by an eloquent 5 year old who welcomes and invites them into his classroom?

In today's day and age most people communicate via text and email. Every day, I encounter adults with a lack of socialization skills that is key in this global society. Muscota children have a nurturing environment to facilitate in building key interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, skills that you can't learn from a textbook.

Muscota's foundation is its community. Strong family involvement is key to its founding and continued vision.

Muscota is one of the few schools that wants parental involvement and input. From the first encounter during a tour with Principal Camille Wallin, I was impressed by the human and personal approach of the faculty and administration. ""Do you have a moment? I want to hear your thoughts on the tour? What could we have done better? What did you like?"" I was shocked that a principal of an urban public school would want the feedback of a person she just met.

It is important to note high family involvement is the key at this school. It's not required but Muscota follows Mayor DeBlasio's tenet, parents are stakeholders in the school system and have a serious say on things that affect their child.

Now that doesn't mean that you can complain or pick and choose what you want for your child but they have an ear open to the parents. The administrative staff have their hands full balancing the ever-changing focuses of the DOE while fighting to retain the philosophy and vision of the founding parents and administration. this dance is not an easy one but with the support of parents and families, the staff work hard to maintain Muscota's character and beliefs.

Parents should come to the administration and faculty with constructive solutions or ideas that will enhance not only their child's experience but also the other children in the community.

Muscota is a small school with a big heart. It is not only your child(ren) who will be enrolled but also your family who will be welcomed into the Muscota home.

There are some things I would like to correct, however. First, the Muscota founding director was Leslie Alexander; it was she and the founding staff and parents who crafted Muscota's original vision and mission.  Most recently, Camille and the staff have carried it forward with the able assistance of the Muscota School Leadership Team, Parent's Association and the current loyal and very involved parent body.  
I will also add that I recently retired from Muscota after 13 years but, when I have visited,  I have felt welcomed and get a feeling that the Muscota we created in 1993 is alive and well.  As I walked through class rooms just last week, I saw students and teachers engaged and excited; there was a calm, well organized, purposeful and safe environment throughout and ample evidence of the school's progressive values and teaching practices.  In my experience, Camille makes it clear that she has high expectations; that she values teachers' input and counts on their experience to make Muscota the best school it can be. 

 I want to reiterate that it's not gone; it is alive and well and can be felt in the kids, the staff and in the learning at Muscota as evidenced by the school's day to day activities and also by the many Muscota traditions that are also alive and well.

Always,

I am very proud and happy to say that I chose to spend most of my years as a NYC public school teacher at this amazing school. In my experience, Muscota always strove to balance its progressive philosophy with the external demands of the educational systems it was accountable to; never an easy task.When walking through the school, these days, there is clear evidence that the Muscota staff and administration still place a great value on being the kind of school community that has children and families' best interest at heart; that children's well being and learning BOTH are at the heart of the matter at Muscota.The comments in this recent post make clear that this Muscota parent feels this is still true. This is extraordinary, given Muscota's recent history and the many changes it has endured through the years. This is a testament to the strength of its original mission; to the communal values this small community works so hard to preserve.Last year, with the advent of a new administration, I felt that I could once again focus on honing my craft. I felt that my ideas were greatly valued; my contributions welcomed, and, that my role as an experienced teacher was highly respected. After years of turmoil, I once again had the opportunity to devote my energies to the work of teaching, to the growth of my students, my involvement with their families and the further development of Muscota's hard working professional community.It was a long awaited change that I welcomed.As a parent and educator, I know that while change is never easy, it is essential for growth. I am very grateful that the Muscota community continues to grow and evolve, even in the current climate that breeds so much uncertainty.Irrespective of the current state of affairs in education, I am ever hopeful because there is a Muscota New School and am thankful for all the forces that helped make possible its continued clear vision and strength of purpose.NYC Public School Teacher",2,0,0,2011-10-10T15:28:34,1.0,0.061,0.193,0.003,0.41200000000000003,0.027000000000000003,0.247,0.040999999999999995,0.03,0.456,0.409,0.047

Camille is very serious about the student's success and making sure they are focused on, safe and engaged.  She has a great presence with the parents, but I am guessing the staff (especially the old staff) find her to be a bully- but that is conjecture.I am beyond please with the organization, the great hires and her ability to get things done.  I will always love this school and give it credit for nurturing and empowering my children.  This is a great neighborhood school with an amazing Parents' Association.  ",2,0,0,2011-10-03T13:33:41,1.0,0.061,0.193,0.003,0.41200000000000003,0.027000000000000003,0.247,0.040999999999999995,0.03,0.456,0.409,0.047

Math is definitely taught. Beginning in kindergarten, children look at the patterns in shape and number. By third grade, they automatically seek patterns to help them solve math problems. This sophisticated algebraic thinking is a Muscota hallmark."" The teacher adds that children go outdoors, and ""taking the time to build and maintain a community is at the core of what we do. This does not preclude children being taught to do math, read, or write. Children are encouraged to help each other in their learning, and to learn to be team players. Muscota kids find out that we are all learners and teachers, and that we share this responsibility as well. Most classrooms have a forum for dealing with the problems that inevitably arise when more than twenty children get together.

In the incident mentioned by a parent about bullying, the victim was not asked to confront the ""bully"" in front of the class. The child was asked to share her story (with the support of the teacher) with the class. The ""bully"" was asked to accept responsiblility for her actions within the community of her peers and teacher; a setting that is safe to tell the truth and where both children could come together with a stronger friendship and regard. The actual strategy and full group conversation is too extensive to go into here but I can say that both children became fast and steady friends. It is also inappropriate to label a 5 year old child as a ""bully"" if one does not know the child well. The behavior was unusual for the child mentioned and did not occur again. When there is a ""secret"" amongst children that is revealed and discussed, the power of the ""bully"" is greatly diminished by the revelation and the ensuing conversation. It is a shame that an individual used such an important forum to malign innocent children and to characterize a conversation that was not witnessed first hand. There is not a problem with bullying at Muscota but rather the normal problems of children acting on their fears, vanities and needs in ways that are sometimes inappropriate, sometimes hurtful but as often as possible acted upon by the teachers in the school in a supportive and safe manner. We want all our children to grow. Even the 'bullies.'"" </P>

06M322,Momof2HHNYC,manhattan,Middle,400,"I wanted to take the time to give my opinion to worrying parents of soon to be middle schoolers. This is my child's first year and I can tell you that it was honestly not my first choice but we went with it. 

My child has improved tremendously since attending ms322. The teachers are great and are always available. My child can email. text or call if he comes across any difficulties with his homework. They have a great system where parents and students can log in everyday and check grades, upcoming homework, behavior and attendance. The teachers update it daily. As a parent, your always ""in the know.""
My son has art, health and clubs. 

The Children Aid Society offers free after-school. All three schools mix in to join. 

The children are average pre-teens. You have some good and some who need extra attention. My son has made friends with good honest kids and I am happy. He hasn't had a problem as far as bulling or fighting. 

The principal is great. If you have any problems she is fast to resolve. She always asks if you need anything and I like that she is in control of everything. There is an assistant principal for each grade and they are wonderful as well. I see them interacting with the children and give advice as mentors.  

The only downfall I see in this school is lack of communication and parent participation. It surprises me that for meeting and workshops parents are a no show. Of course, I understand many work and I can see where meeting should be held on some evenings, but this has to change. I see no reason for this school not to get the support it needs from its parents to make it a top school. We need to join together as a community and maybe with the new strong parent coordinator ( previous one resigned) and a stronger PTA it can happen.

I had the wonderful opportunity of spending time with some of the teachers at a camping trip and got to see first hand just how enthusiastic, energetic and dedicated they are to their craft.

06M324,Sally Cabrera,manhattan,Middle,340,"I graduated from MS324 in 2010. I love this school unconditionally and I know that when I have my children someday, this is the school I would send my children to. I just graduated high school and many say that high school are the best years of your life, but to me, middle school (MS324) were the best years of my life. In 2007, all incoming 6th graders were shy and scared - which makes sense after going to a whole new school and atmosphere than the previous school you attended, in which you were there for 6-7 years. The school welcomed me and everyone else with open arms. The way that you had at least one staff member who was your friend was a great feeling, and you grew to become very close to your teacher too. I met my best friend in middle school and now we're going to the same college in the Fall! Literally every staff member cared for every single student at 324, and I know that it seems like I'm just writing it just because, but they really did. If there was an issue, they would hold you after class and ask what's going on and see if there was any way they could resolve the issue. They also knew when someone was getting bullied in school or at home, when the student wouldn't physically tell anyone, and they would act on it by helping or calling someone who could help (although there was NEVER any bullying whatsoever at 324). There was always cool events that the school like small dances to raise money for other trips so students would either have to not pay or pay a minimal price, and had and at least one field trip was happening every month. I don't know if they still have this program at 324, but 324 was part of this program called Project BOOST, which rewarded high achieving students with really cool field trips (I was part of this program during my 8th grade year), examples include trips to see Broadway plays, restaurants, games, movies, and even taking us to Barnes and Nobles and buying us a book! The school is all about pushing the student to reach their fullest potential. And even then, there is no such thing as complacency in the school by means of, staff members kept pushing you. MS324 takes in students with low standardized test scores and bumps them up to a high level. All the teachers show absolute commitment, which in turn inspires the student to become absolutely dedicated to school work and learning. The Principal, Ms. Heller knew everyone and is the epitome of what a school principal should be. She would take time out of her busy schedule every morning to do line-ups with every class (to check up on every class, give insightful information, to encourage students, etc.), before sending the classes upstairs to get started. During the day, she would visit classes just to see how everyone was and she even helped children herself who were stumped on a topic in whatever subject the class was in (this one time she came into our gym class when we had a substitute teacher and led exercises for us, which was pretty cool, how many people can say that their principal came in and exercised with you during gym?). If a student was upset or sad, she would take time out of her day to be that helping hand. She also was not a push over (definitely not), she is very strict, but in a good way. She would not hesitate to enact disciplinary action when necessary. She became a role model to many students, including myself. The system of having a PACT sheet everyday (a paper in which the class gets graded and rated on overall performance, such as behavior, attention, etc..) also kept the classes in line. 324 is also VERY BIG on college readiness and carrying on the message that all students must go on to college after high school, seeing as in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, there are many high school dropouts who end up not doing anything except freelance. 324 did not want us to become a ""statistic"" and wanted us to break all barriers that held Hispanics/African-Americans in the dark. The super tight knit community of 324 also helped a great deal in my development as an adolescent; because of this closeness with everyone, it truly felt like a family or a second home. I became so excited and happy to come to school everyday (except test days). This school became such a big part in my development in life and inspired me to achieve so much more, because we actually had people tell us we were champions and could do anything our heart desires, and mean it with the most sincerity. I would recommend this school to ANY and EVERY incoming student. I sure know that on the last day of school, I cried because I did not want to leave. If I had the chance to repeat my middle school years, I wouldn't change a thing because MS 324 is absolutely perfect and amazing in every single way.",1,0,0,2014-07-09T04:58:25,0.5,0.33799999999999997,0.309,0.124,0.9,0.203,0.8290000000000001,0.009000000000000001,0.115,0.841,0.032,0.223

Coming from experience with the school staff, they can be disrespectful (Unnecessary screaming, nasty attitude etc.) including the security which hardly do their jobs, they're more concerned with the students uniform policy instead of looking out for the students and protecting them. Also the deans at the school act like they don't want to be there and don't like working with the students. When my parents come to the school, the staff are disrespectful. Lots of the staff go by their own rules which can be confusing and you can tell they don't even follow their own rules. A lot of the teachers choose favorites and treat them better than the other students (letting them not go by rules but getting other students in trouble for doing the same). Usually, I would have to go straight to the principal for anything if I really need something cause most staff is unhelpful and do what they want. The principal is great, it's just the staff that needs fixing. There are some teachers that actually do their jobs, care about their students and want to help out but alot of the staff treat the students poorly and makes the students react offensively ending in unnecessary punishments. There's alot of unnecessary punishments like being a minute late ends up to be an hour detention after school, the school believes that punishments fix us and helps us but it's extremely unaffective. Lots of the unnecessary punishments ends up with students missing class time which is the point of going to school in the first place and should be a priority. Overall, the school staff has lots of fixing to do, many should be fired for not doing their job efficiently.",0,0,0,2016-04-13T01:08:55,1.0,0.18,0.263,0.054000000000000006,0.8909999999999999,0.133,0.813,0.004,0.094,0.878,0.022000000000000002,0.201

The school leadership has not yet realized  how to make the school work and keep on going from one idea to the next, instead of working on one thing at a time and moving on once that is mastered.

As an alumni in from this school I can wholeheartedly say that this school is one of the worst schools I have ever come across. I have transferred schools from 4th grade to 10th grade but this is by far the worst school I've attended. The kids here do not care about your feelings and are highly stereoypical with cliques and narrow-minded opinions. They highlight the jocks and if you are in anyway different they mock and look down on you. In fact there have been SUICIDES in this school because of how horrible these kids were towards other children. WHEELS also lies to you AND your child, they will hold them back because they did not pass THEIR requirements even though they have passed the STATE requirements. I have had close friends of mine transfer to another school that would graduate them ON TIME because they had all the state requirements but WHEELS would tell them they'd graduate NEXT YEAR. They've also lied about what colleges look for in students, stating that if you do not have a 85 average you will be rejected from good colleges and have to resort to community college when I've seen COUNTLESS seniors with 70 averages get into John Jay and City College. They pressure students to take classes they don't need also. If your child is a senior, do not be surprised if they have 2 or three classes that they do NOT need for graduation and are only there to drain their GPA and increase stress. The only good thing about this school is how caring some teachers can be, other than that everything is in this school is pure trash. Please stay away if you love your child!",0,0,0,2014-05-21T02:50:44,0.75,0.22899999999999998,0.244,0.031,0.82,0.131,0.718,0.018000000000000002,0.024,0.8909999999999999,0.057999999999999996,0.209
06M348,Dayana Dominguez,manhattan,K-8,450,"I am currently a 10th grade student and I've been in this school since 6th grade.The fact that students are behaving negatively towards other has nothing to do with the way this school helps students academically. This school provides various student counselors to help students deal with their emotions and their personal lives. Ever since I enrolled, each semester we take one extra class for three days a week (the days we have gym, we don't take it). So no, they do not ""pressure students to take classes they don't need"". That alternative class is almost always a Spanish class and/or art/music. They do not tell us that unless we have an 85 average we won't attend colleges. They simply tell students that most colleges look for students with an 85 average. They never say that ""you will be rejected from good colleges and have to resort to community colleges"". The only true thing you wrote down in this overall false comment is that the teachers are caring. Indeed, they are. A year before I entered middle school, a WHEELS student did commit suicide and people believed it was due to her 7th grade's math teacher's bullying. I believe the teacher was looked into and found innocent of these allegations. So no, there have not ""been SUICIDES in this school because of how horrible these kids were towards other children"". Although the school building is not as big as students would want it to be, Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning Schools is a very good school.

Based
on many problems observed by parents during the past few years, it seems that
WHA’s new principal could have a lot of old messes to clean up. But overall the
school is running much more smoothly than it was at this time last year. There
is good reason to expect that the school’s recruitment, admissions, and
registration process will be handled more effectively during the upcoming year.

The fact that all of the parents who have posted comments feel their
children are doing well at Washington Heights Academy is a credit to the
school’s strong teachers, who have done their utmost for students in spite of
the school’s weak leadership. The school's Learning Environment Surveys reflect
consistently low principal ratings that have steadily declined each year. With
new and improved leadership, there is hope that the school’s outstanding staff
will receive the support that all teachers need and deserve. It is time for our
school community to heal and move forward.

In April, another mom received a call from a staff person in the school to tell her that my son and 3 other kids were being targeted by the SE teacher, the same one I had been complaining about for 5 months. This mom went to Mr. Reilly, who stated that no one had complained about this teacher before and that there was nothing to be concerned about.  5 other parents had already complained! Our children developed anxiety because the Special Education teacher started taking away free time from students for spelling a word wrong or getting a math question wrong. These are first graders!
My only regret is not putting a camera on my son to get proof of the abuse that was happening. The teacher was screaming, humiliating, and pulling on my son's arm forcefully. This is not a school for children with special needs.  I have continually had problems with his services and most of the teachers are not equipped to work with kids with special needs.  HHS has a practice of having kids share paras to save money and don't want to give services because their budget is very small. They will insist that they can serve your child, but I assure you they cannot. Once you are in the school, it is hard to get out or transfer elsewhere, which I learned the hard way. My son was spending hours of his day wandering the halls and I didn't know this until the end of the year, when I had him evaluated for another program which sent a team into observe him. My son now hates school and it's going to take a while for him to ease back in to a new one. I had to constantly explain his disability to professionals who are supposed to be familiar with children's disabilities and the challenges they present. 

I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this school.  The way the situation with my son was handled was terrible.  I know that you think this could never happen to your kid, I didn't either, but it did and I will forever regret not getting recorded proof so that I can prevent this happening to someone else's child. I went through the proper channels to report it but without a recording, there is nothing. Please do your homework, find another place to put your child with special needs!",0,0,0,2019-07-22T20:05:54,1.0,0.168,0.20800000000000002,0.006999999999999999,0.693,0.268,0.523,0.034,0.201,0.49700000000000005,0.20800000000000002,0.21600000000000003

It will help him for the rest of his life. I truly can't thank you enough and will be forever a fan of HHS and its approach to learning.. 
I'm sorry to see our beloved Prinicple Alva leave.The HHS community will definitely miss you!!!. I wish you well in your new endeavors and I know you have built a solid foundation and the new Principle will only have to continue the good work you have started. 
I highly recommend HHS to any parent who is seeking a great school for their K- 5th student.

06M368,parent,manhattan,Elementary,149,"<p>Our experience at the school was not the most pleasant. Our concerns were noted at most, but our child was very unhappy here. As far as my comment from Sept.,it was my honest unbiased initial impression, and it was pretty consistent throughout the school year. I believe the weakest point of this school is not the teachers or families, but rather the administration. The school is divided in two locations and perhaps this is where the directors are missing the details that make a school function 100% Others may not have the sme experience we did, my comments are meant to encourage parents to take a second look at schools before enrolling their children and asking all the questions possible. I am thankful to the teachers and parent coordinator for their time and efforts and look forward to a better experience at my child's new school.</p>",3,0,0,2009-10-14T20:05:54,1.0,0.168,0.20800000000000002,0.006999999999999999,0.693,0.268,0.523,0.034,0.201,0.49700000000000005,0.20800000000000002,0.21600000000000003

Recess is held in the school courtyard and children are allowed to run freely with again only one staff member and how many ever parents volunteer that day.

The staff appear disorganized and equally as lost as the new children, however, they are friendly. The secretary has a rude demeanor when approached with questions. The cafeteria staff are loud.  I came in to the school expecting  lot more, but it seems like the management is the school's weakness.

She goes to the cafeteria everyday to look at us and if she sees you sad she takes you to her office. She also waits for us everyday in the morning to say good morning and looks for whoever is sad or upset. If you graduated 9 months ago you should know this. How about all the projects we have to do about accepting and including everyone? All the projects and stuff that she makes us do. Yeah she can be annoying because she checks for uniform but she explains it is so that kids don’t bully each other because of what they wear. She is running around all day talking to students and comes to our games on Saturdays. Takes us to visit colleges. And even helps students with their class work. 
She is against suspensions. And I even think she talks a lot all the time telling us to avoid getting in trouble and use our words to express our feelings. She can even be OD annoying talking so much everyday and repeating the same things about tutoring she offers in whatever you need and talking about High School, College and making good decisions to graduate on time and not go to summer school. So my man I don’t know what you talking about. 
I am not a saint and I was very disrespectful and she made me change my ways by talking and showing me I can do better. She never suspended me but always told me to stay away from the things that can end up in suspensions. The thing is that she tell you you are responsible for your actions and they have consequences. She tries to teach you real life stuff. True she is annoying sometimes because she thinks all students can be friends and respectful but that’s just the way she sees us. 
The assistant principal always helps too and the principal is the nicest ever and always there for us. I graduate this year and feel sad I am leaving. Teachers are cool.

You have monolingual students sitting in transtional bilingual classrooms and vice versa. This is the case througout the school. I find that your review lacks accuracy and maybe you should revisit the school and choose the classes you would like to visit. I am sure that you were shown a specific class to help you form your review. The school environment needs progress. Once, I was sitting in the school office waiting for my child to come down, I witnessed Ms. Toledo yelling at a young female teacher, pointing her fingers at the teacher and screaming, ""Don't push my buttons"".

The building has issues with clean water and rats. My daughter has seen several rats and mice. The school has no library or extra curricular activities. If they did, I have no idea about them because the school doesn't communicate very well. There are no sports either. PTA meetings are at 8:45am??? Clearly they don't want engaged working parents to attend, nor do they even try to have a second session in the evening. Other meetings they have are parent cook sessions at 8:45am.....um how about parent student behavior workshops, not a damn cooking class? Majority of the children are very disruptive to the point where the teachers aren't teaching but trying to get the classroom under control. Bright students fall behind because teachers have to focus on those yelling all the time. Nothing is electronic, you can not check on your child's behavior or grades online, and there are no computers. There are no field trips. The school's disciplinary action is a joke. I witnessed a mother upset that her son was bullied and confronted what appeared to be a teacher or aid. The teachers response was that because they didn't see it there was nothing they can do and they need to find the adult that did witness it. He didn't even try to console her or direct her to someone who can actually help her. It was ridiculous!

07X049,A pre-K parent,bronx,Elementary,566,"I think this profile is a bit outdated. At least I don't recognize the school my 4-year-old attends in it. It's now almost February and her pre-K class has yet to take more than one walk around the neighborhood much less visit a farm, museum, or other library. They have no recess, ever (the AP blames the teachers for not wanting to go outside and the teachers assure me that it's actually a school policy; something about not considering the neighborhood safe enough for the kids to be outside! Well, newsflash: we all live here and most of us walk with our kids to school.) And they only have PE once a week. 

They do give the younger kids' families access to the Cool Culture card, which enables us to visit many cultural institutions that would otherwise be too expensive to go to on a regular basis. But we do that on our own time.

The dynamic principal? I don't see that either. My brief interaction with her showed me someone who was entirely condescending and patronizing. She didn't even bother to ask my name before launching into a lecture. And this is in addition to reading my child's name and mistaking her gender because it is not a common English name.

I do find the teachers and staff we interact with on the whole to be caring and engaged (if a tad overly concerned with discipline and arbitrary rules). And I have few complaints about the general vibe in the class. But the school also seems unable to withstand the testing/standards frenzy. My daughter gets homework most days and extra packets to complete over vacation, which to me is ridiculous for kids younger than 8 and defeats the purpose of having a holiday. 

I wish the atmosphere were more lively and that the school resembled the one in the description above more. I'd be a lot happier about her continuing to go to this since it's our zoned school and I truly believe that we need neighborhood schools to be centers of caring communities. But sadly, this school has a long way to go. We are applying to others for next year.

We also went to a couple of colleges to see some pretty awesome plays and at one point my class planted flowers in front of the school. We had music, art and dance and my dance class got to do a really awesome dance all around the auditorium. But we were disciplined. When I was in school if a student misbehaved, they were kicked out of the classroom. Schools aren't allowed to do that anymore. Each new generation of kids seem to become more and more misbehaved and get disciplined less and less.

07X161,NYC Employee,bronx,Elementary,392,"I worked at PS 161, and want to direct my comment to prospective teachers thinking about working here.

I see many of the comments here are about disruptive students. I felt that this behavior was about the same as other schools with high economic need. The children are not the problem at this school.

The biggest issue is administration. The principal is very hands off and lets the APs handle everything, even answering her emails. They are quite disorganized, i.e. sometimes they announce the wrong times for meetings/assemblies, or they say they will provide you some support and then never do it.

Worst of all, one of the APs is a bully who likes to play favorites and abuse her power. Teachers live in fear of getting yelled at and written up for minor incidents. She has a need to control everything: your bulletin boards, your classroom furniture, your lesson plans. UFT knows about this, but she gets away with it because she will argue with everything and twist the contract wording around. She barges in on teachers during their prep/lunch to make them do something. She has even threatened not to recommend tenure for effective-rated teachers. I firmly believe she is the main reason why 161 has high teacher turnover.

Another consideration for candidates is there are charter schools all around 161, so enrollment is constantly dropping. They have lost a lot of funding and will need to let teachers go (even tenured teachers). So if you get a job here, your job could be gone very quickly.

07X221,Marilyn Valentin,bronx,Middle,268,"There’s no denying that SBP is
part of my story.


More than 306,000 seconds, 756
days, 5,100 hours, and 7 years of my life have been spent inside the walls of South
Bronx Prep. I’ve been taught by over 20 teachers, taken various exams, and
handed in more homework assignments then I can count.  My days as a student at SBP ended in June 2011
as part of the first 6-12 graduating class. I had the privilege of growing
simultaneously with my school having been one of the very first students of
SBP. 


SBP has been a home to me and
continues to be one for so many students today. The strong sense of community
is comforting and contributes to a welcoming and safe atmosphere. SBP’s teachers
not only educate their students but
many of them act as a vent to the students as well.  It’s always been a priority that students
perform well academically but it’s equally important that they feel comfortable
among their peers and aren’t feeling burdened with life outside of school.  


 But of course, academics are just as imperative.
As a student at SBP I was challenged intellectually and pushed to my absolute
full potential. Not only are students pushed to deliver their best
academically, students are able to seek plenty of one-on-one assistance and
further clarification of in-class material after school hours. 


Not only did I enjoy experiences
multiple teaching styles, but I was able to take advantage of a dependable
support system, make friends, and participate in a variety of clubs and student
organizations. I even had the opportunity to start my own organization that is
still running strongly after 2 years and is currently in its 3rd
chapter.


Because I spoke up abut something
I wanted changed I had the option to start something new at my school. SBP
offers plenty of opportunities for students to speak up, ask for change, and
lead the changes. As such a tightly-knit community I think it’s a very
important aspect that ANY small school should have.


I left SBP feeling prepared for
the real world and its challenges. I walked out with a diploma in hand, an
essence of college readiness, and even left a legacy. Yes, it’s safe to say
that SBP isn’t perfect, and that is why teachers, administrators, and staff
strive to work together as a team to keep moving forward and overcome and improve
the weaknesses in SBP’s system.  But if
you, parent, and your child are willing to grow alongside SBP with all its pros
and cons I believe your student has a place and would be more than content at
SBP.",0,0,0,2013-01-30T12:51:58,0.75,0.09300000000000001,0.295,0.08199999999999999,0.937,0.187,0.836,0.015,0.231,0.72,0.022000000000000002,0.147
07X221,Dino,bronx,Middle,268,"South Bronx Prep (SBP) is located within a community where the
main freedom from hardships are through education, and with so many people
missing out on the opportunity it makes it harder for statistics to be positive,
but South Bronx Preparatory has made it possible by opening its doors in 2004
with a goal of changing the atmosphere of the once known Elijah Clark and forming
a community of middle and high school students.  Some may think the span of 6th grades
through 12th in one concentrated space may be inappropriate, but the
truth is that it unifies everyone as a whole, and that is not just by the
uniform policy. Interactions of the seven different grade levels give each and
every student the privilege to communicate and break down the barriers of age.
Not only making sure that the community of students are well associated, the
administrators, teachers and staff play their part extremely well. They elicit
a sense of safety and security for the students- even the role of a mentor.

A school is to be the common ground for learning and
success, and with the universal College Board curriculum it makes all students
think, plan, prepare, and eventually initiate the college process when they are
high school seniors. 



Ready or not for college South Bronx Prep will get you ready
for it. As an alumnus of SBP I can attest to the fact that there are no excuses
for any student as to why they are not ready for the next step of their
educational career. Teachers, administrators and staff will be the backbone of
every student the moment they enter and until the day they leave through the
doors of SBP, and it doesn’t end there. Once you commit yourself to SBP it’s a
done deal; consider your educational career a success.



If a support system like the one South Bronx Preparatory
generated is not amazing I do not know what else is. I praise this school for
their continuous strive in making sure that no one is left behind. This school
is unlike others, do not let the smaller scale of students fool you, but it’s
the advantage of my alma mater SBP. And I am proud to say I attended, persevered,
conquered and continued on, and my communication with the school is ongoing. One
cannot forget the assistance from all of SBP in the struggle towards success. I
made it and anyone’s child can too.",0,0,0,2013-01-03T15:21:07,0.75,0.09300000000000001,0.295,0.08199999999999999,0.937,0.187,0.836,0.015,0.231,0.72,0.022000000000000002,0.147

dc, NYC April 10th, 2011 11:34 pm
""I know a fifth grade teacher at a neighboring south bronx elementary school. I am told that to these fifth graders, MS 223 is highly desirable. Most of them do not get accepted. Who does? MS 223 is a ""choice"" school (see insideschools.org re: 223 admissions). Like the fifth graders at this local S Bronx elementary school, neighborhood children can request the school, but they don't necessarily get in. So when Mr Gonzalez says he takes them as they walk in the door, if you think that means he must take anyone, that's not true. Most of the children are accepted competitively, from what I understand, that is the definition of 'choice' school when too many 'choose' it. Since too many list 223, at least from this one neighboring elementary school, it has the ability to pick the 'best' of the lot, for the most part, and does (though some students might be assigned there). The better students are chosen, the rest are left to MS 162 or MS 224 or other less desirable middle schools. ""Better"" is a relative word, particularly in that neighborhood where many barely perform at or below grade level. Nonetheless, clearly due to its popularity and 'choice' admissions, there is some selection over many who apply vs those who are admitted Its popularity, no doubt, is due to Mr Gonzalez in large part.""The above is very true. My son and I live across the street from this school, I open my curtains and see this school. MS223 is his zoned school, yet he was not accepted. We attended both the open house and interview. I was told by the female interviewer ""his porfolio was excellent (this included teacher recommendations) and that he did very well"". When the acceptance letters went out, he was assigned to another District 7 school. When we called MS223 we were told a song and dance story about their process. One of his classmates who didn't bother attending the open house or the interview was accepted (he lives in another district) which goes to show how true the above NYT comment really is. Word of Advice: Don't be fooled by the rising test scores for this school. The scores only rose because they choose students who are better testers. This means that even if your child is an overall great student but gets nervous during testing, they won't even bother looking at him/her as a potential student.If you're a District 7 middle school parent, don't box yourself into thinking MS223 is the only choice because you'll be wasting your time on the open house and interview process. There are plenty of charter schools that are willing to take your child and help them grow as a student, you just have to look for them. There is a new charter school opening in that same building (not sure the date it opens) which means you will have yet another option for your middle school child.",0,1,0,2011-07-06T16:04:52,0.75,0.092,0.22399999999999998,0.054000000000000006,0.924,0.136,0.847,0.01,0.14300000000000002,0.8270000000000001,0.013999999999999999,0.23199999999999998
