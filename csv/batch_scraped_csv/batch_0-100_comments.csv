The principal, Irene Sanchez, leads an incredible group of attentive teachers and administrators who are dedicated to providing a safe, caring, and exciting environment for children to learn. The G&T program is enrichment based (not ""accelerated"") and has re-instilled a sheer joy of learning in our child, which is a priority for us as a family. Of the many enrichments, the kids have a dedicated STEAM teacher, dedicated Science teacher, special interest classes that the children choose every Friday, a wonderful music class, and 2nd graders attend swimming once a week at Asphalt Green. There are also many field trips and hands on, project-based learning opportunities. The children have an amazing playground attached to the school and are allowed to play outside before and after school and during recess. They also have a great gym and have gym class three times a week. The small class sizes (our son currently has 16 children in his G&T class) is another amazing thing about this school and something that is hard to find in the NYC public school system. Another aspect I appreciate so much at PS15 is how open the lines of communication are. The teachers, staff and principal always make time to address any concerns. There is also a parent coordinator, Lanette Murphy (Ms. Mia), who will literally move mountains to address any issues you or your child might be having, whether they be logistical or more complex in nature. Most importantly, this is a school that puts an enormous amount of effort into teaching social emotional skills and into supporting their community of parents and children. They teach, by example, what it means to be curious, kind, generous, patient, tolerant and supportive. We have learned so much from P.S. 15 and feel privileged to be a part of such a special school.', ""A Hidden Gem!\nAmazing community school that feels like an extension to my family. Teachers and staff are amazing and friendly. They genuinely care about my kids, their progress and overall well-being. A chapter of my son's life and mine is ending as he is graduating this year. I truly appreciate the Principal's leadership Irene Sanchez, the Parent Coordinator La'Nette Murphy, the school nurse Ms. Brenda and all the teachers and staff that made a difference in my kids life. Shout out to the Science Teacher Ms. Sullivan, the Technology Teacher Ms. Sacks, the Gym Teachers Coach D, Coach Ramirez.

Where else do you get access to the Principal AND Asst Principal EVERY DAY? They stand outside or in the cafeteria and greet all parents and children every morning. It sets the tone for the school. The school makes ALL children and parents feel included. New PTA has been incredible this year and have also made parents feel welcomed. My kids have had their moments but issues like teasing/bullying happen every where. I appreciate bringing it to the attention of teachers/staff and having it handled. I do wish there were more sports options offered to the lower grades. A lot of the resources bought in are for grades 3-5. They have an incredible PE teacher and Wellness program so more emphasis should be on sports, but I get it DOE is all about curriculum and testing. I suggest coming into the school and taking a tour, wonderful gem in L.E.S', ""Hello parents, when my first child went to and graduated ps.20, we had an amazing experience. The principal was so supportive and kind, and actually cared about his students. Then, he left and everything was in a state of disarray. The new principal wasted our money and is stealing money from the school's funds, asking for more and more money. My youngest son was attending ps.20 when the new principal was in charge. It was terrible, the school spent no effort or money on the children's education, and now the principal is telling the teachers to not print out any more homework and test papers. CHEAP.

The school has a very active parent community who have a great relationship with school leaders and who take action. Issues and concerns are addressed in an honest and upfront way, solutions embraced and successes recognized. I have one child in the dual language program and have seen her confidence and passion for learning language really evolve. What an incredible value for her to be academically fluent in another language! The school has a lot of nonprofit involvement and WITS (wellness in the schools) in particular has played a role in my kids learning to love and eat a variety of healthy food. (They even learned how to slice and prepare a few things). I also have to mention the school safety officers--their consistent presence has a positive effect on kids entering the building.

We have had an excellent experience at the school. \n\n Anna Silver is welcoming,friendly, orderly, and energetic. My son's teacher, Mrs. Torres, is exceptional. She has 13+ years experience and 4 children of her own, and it shows. She is calm, cool, and collected when managing the classroom and also warm and attentive to the individual needs of each student. My husband and I are consistently impressed with her professionalism and efficiency. She has provided thoughtful feedback at each of our son's reviews and has identified key strategies to optimize his growth and development. I am so appreciative of the individual attention she provides.  \n\nThe class sizes at Anna Silver are smaller than the city-wide average. Our son's class has 18 students and, in addition to his teacher, a full-time assistant teacher.  Mrs. Zakaria is a constant ray of sunshine and I am so thankful for her presence.  \n\nAnna Silver's facilities are impressive. The school has a large playground,  gymnasium, cafeteria, and auditorium.  There is dedicated time for recess each day and plenty of space where the children can move.  There are well maintained learning centers in each classroom and opportunities for child centered learning and play.  (Pre-K students are also taught more traditional reading fundamentals, the alphabet, and  numbers.)\n\nI echo the praise given to the school's administration by previous commenters.  Principal James Lee, Assistant Principal Jen Chase, and Parent Coordinator Tracey Arrington were a significant factor in my choosing Anna Silver.  They set the tone for the school.  Their earnest, accessible, and up-beat energy are present in all of the interactions I've had at the school.  They have cultivated a wonderful culture at the Anna Silver school that is evident even in the friendly manner in which the security guards first greet you.  Everyone seems to enjoy being there.\n\nAnother notable strength of PS 20 is the abundance of outside programs and community partnerships.  This year we have benefited directly from PS 20's affiliation with Turtle Bay Music and Wellness in the Schools. I look forward to my son enjoying the other many opportunities available to upper grades in the coming years.\n\nI highly recommend this school."", 'I am from the class of 2013 at PS.20.

On top of that, Ms. lukatos (the principal) should try to branch out to other ethnicities in areas in Manhattan and other boroughs in the city  because the school isn’t diverse enough and could have more students than it does.

Our administrative team has unlocked teacher leadership pathways with their many years of being educators as well as their knowledge of the current trends in best practices. As for favoritism to a select few, I would like to say that authentic hard work and collaboration is valued! Does that sound like favoritism or simply the recognition of people who understand that we are held accountable to educating children? Anything less than that is simply a degradation to the creed of educators.', ""I would never recommend this school to a parent searching for a school for their child or a teacher looking for a job. There is a reason that the enrollment at PS 34 is pitifully low, with enrollment decreasing every year.  As a teacher, it is nearly impossible to do the job of teaching because every day is a battle of wills with a gang of disruptive students in each class who do not come to school ready to learn. For the ones who do want to learn, they are robbed of their opportunity to learn on a daily basis. Parents, as a whole, are uninvolved and disinterested in the educational process and the school administrators do not support teachers in matters of discipline, leaving them to deal with disruptions all day, every day. Although many of the students are curios and bright, the children learn little and the state test scores don't lie! The principal (who has but a few years of actual teaching experience) blames teachers for low scores, harasses the ones she doesn't like, and rewards her few favorites with high scores on observations and plum positions out of the classroom and AWAY from kids! 40% of the teachers left this year...wonder why. The negative culture of blame, low expectations, and favoritism has completely corrupted this school. Do not send your child here or be tempted to work here."", ""I agree with this statement. Particularly, the culture of blame part. Principal Angeliki Loukatos rarely gives support to her teachers, both professionally and emotionally, and is not clear with communicating. She is not a present leader and stays in her office majority of the time. She is almost never seen by the students or the staff. The only time she visits classrooms is when she is required to do observations. She is not familiar with her students, her staff or what's going on in her school. Things are unavoidably going to go wrong when there is no guidance, support, or clear expectations. When something does goes wrong, she blames her teachers. Instead of changing, she stays exactly the same; in her office and away from us. At the same time, she blames others for the shortcomings of HER school. No school can thrive with weak leadership. Neither the principal nor the assistant principal is reflective. They refuse to accept responsibility for their inept leadership skills. Administration does not facilitate growth at PS/MS 34, it impedes it."", ""You as bad as them all you ain't no good read the bible what come around goes around you will never be happy as miss Hart and that evil eye Jacobs you lied to Mrs Daniela"", 'I give P.S.34 a low grade why give a student a diploma then take it away all they doing is making matters worst... then make everyone cover the mess and making them principle you should live with this guilt miss Gonzalez you fake..you should of said the truth you covered then up', 'My son was abused by another student in 2nd grade.

My years in Shuang Wen were nothing but growth and hard work, fortified by a relentless passion for learning that each teacher shared. \n\nChinese was always a second language and I speak English mainly. However, I can write, read, and communicate fluently in Mandarin with teachers, family members, and relatives just because of a few classes, not because I was born Chinese. Therefore, the allegations that Shuang Wen is only for Asians and that any other race is doomed to fail in Shuang Wen is beyond absurd. I came into Shuang Wen knowing how to speak Cantonese, a whole other dialect that actually can negatively hinder the learning of Mandarin. That being said, ANYONE can attend Shuang Wen and successfully learn Mandarin, just like I did. The ability to perform and perfect is mainly on the student, as a true craftsman does not blame his tools for his imperfections. Every student is given the same attention and knowledge, and it is up to them to grasp and absorb. Even if they fail to, I do not know one teacher in Shuang Wen that was not willing to sit down in their free time to explain it again.\n\nIn addition, Shuang Wen isn't racist or racially exclusive to Asians. The school embraces anyone that comes with an open heart and an open mind that is willing to learn. Anyone that was part of the student body was part of the family that made the learning experience thorough and enjoyable. Attending Shuang Wen means accepting and willing to learn Chinese and all the knowledge that is offered, and does not mean being forced, unhappily to take on a Chinese class. \n\nEducation is a virtue that everyone has a choice to take and to refuse. Do not blame the school or the teachers because you found it as a vice. I did not and am forever grateful for the skills and intellect that I was able to acquire over the years at Shuang Wen."", ""As a former graduate from this school, it is an extreme frustration to see so many false statements both in the website's review and the discussion section. Shuang Wen is truly an honorable school that I am utmost proud of for having been able to attend. As a new immigrant with no Mandarin background, I was able to become fluent in Mandarin with the help of both the daytime Chinese teachers, such as Ms. Tsao, and the afterschool Chinese teachers from SWAN. Despite the ignorance of those not having learned Chinese before, Chinese is an extremely challenging language that can only be learned if one is willing to put time and effort into learning it. I admit that I even considered dropping out because it was hard, but with the encouragement of my parents, I decided to continue. My fluency in Mandarin has allowed me to be considered for jobs over candidates who do not have this advantage. Every time I encounter a situation when Mandarin is used, I am reminded of how grateful I am to Shuang Wen and all the members of the Shuang Wen family for helping me be the successful person I am today. \nVisiting Shuang Wen now is a whole other story. Not only are a great number of teachers that have worked for numerous years in Shuang Wen been leaving, but the team spirit and the sense of community has slowly begun to drift apart.  "", ""What happened to this school came out of no where. It took not only the parents by surprise, but the kids there as well. I started at Shuang Wen as a kindergartener, and I can say that SWS was not just a place I went to everyday but school, but it was also my family. At Shuang Wen, I met my best friend, whom still is my best friend to this day. Shuang Wen prepared me as a well rounded person as I entered high school, and taught me responsibility and social manners. \nIt's sad that a few parents feel that their child did not get the same experience that I have, but it's even worse to ruin other's education because of that reason. Many students transferred out of SWS when our old principal was forced to step down, and many teachers left as well. Our principal was the building block of SWS, and she created the community and environment of the school we all felt so safe in. To the parents that got her forcefully removed, was it really our school that made your child feel that way? Or was it just you that could not accept that a school like SWS with such a unique environment existed. \nThere were many options that you could have taken, one being to remove your child from our school, and not ruin the educational experience of so many others. \nI sincerely hope these parents that caused these events to Shuang Wen realize the sadness they've brought to so many students, and realize that doing so, did not bring happiness to their own child. Think about all the friendships you've ruined for your child in the process, and think about the monstrous acts that you've taught your child for their future."", '""A lot of people just assumed it was a private school,"" said one community leader, ""because they saw limousines dropping kids off and mostly Asian kids going in.""\nP.S is clearly a public school. Where did you see ""limousines"" dropping kids off? Are you sure it wasn\'t just a Jeep? Stop hating on the Asians. The school offers both English and Chinese. If people in the neighborhood are reluctant to apply because they don\'t want to learn Chinese or because of the majority of Asian people there, then you cannot blame them (the kids attending the school) for it. \nSecondly, parents still have to pay for their children to attend the afterschool program. They are not being forced into it. And since students are paying to learn Chinese, why attempt to hinder learning by trying to replace afterschool classrooms with ""free art classes""?', ""just because your child wrote poorly doesn't mean everyone in shuang wen wrote poorly.

01M363,"['One of my kids has been at TNS six years, and I have another in the younger grades. It\'s a community that values and encourages diversity, meets students where they are academically and embraces the tenets of progressive education as best it can within the confines of the NYC Dept of Ed structure. The project-based learning approach allows teachers to integrate various subjects into an overarching idea, and classroom work is supplemented by relevant field trips in the city (for example, when studying immigration a third grade class visited Ellis Island and the Tenement Museum to learn about early 20th Century immigration, as well as the International Center of Photography to see a photographic narrative of the WWII Japanese internment camps). We have found the teachers and administration to be approachable, accessible and willing to listen. One of my children is a voracious reader and not so good at math. The other is strong in math and has difficulty with reading. The school has worked with both of them to develop assignments that meet their needs. A note on state tests and scores: the vast majority of families (over 75%) opt out of state tests and no test prep is taught in school so as not to interfere with the curriculum. Families who do choose to participate in testing are supported. I would very highly recommend TNS to those families looking for a socially conscious progressive school with a big heart. In our experience, students here become critical thinkers eager not only to learn but also to ask ""how"" and ""why"".', 'Our family has been part of the TNS community for three years now.  When we decided to go to TNS my child was just 4 years old.  I had no idea what I really wanted in a school except that I wanted my child to be happy and to learn.  But what we got was so much more, We are now part of a community of learners and my Child has found a place where they have encouraged growth and exploration.  They have encouraged curiosity and the questioning of what is right and wrong. The components of social justice and equity are incorporated into the school from the very early years and the faculty truly believes in the their pedagogy. Children are taught through project based learning inside and out of the classroom. With field trips to museums and local businesses, parks, green markets, Iceskating, the beach, farms, and camp the students see so much of New York.  From the Staten Island Ferry, to Riis Park, The Queens farm Museum, Central Park, The Whitney, The Jewish Museum, the Transit Museum,  the theater, to short walks around the community, the teachers take advantage of the city has to offer.\nThere is an active PTA, but more volunteers are always needed for all the events that the PTA sponsors. These events include a Holiday fair, spring Auction, Movie nights, book fair, Popcorn Fridays, bake sales and numerous other events.\nBut one of the best events the school has is school wide sing that the entire school community participates in monthly. From the Principal on down the school believes in progressive education and Dyanthe(the principal) is a dynamic leader. There is active parent input and teachers are readily available to parents. Teachers work hard to make sure that the needs of students are met and plans are created to ensure that students that are having problems get the added support that is needed.\nThere is so much more to say about the school but I suggest you visit for yourself.', 'Pros - It\'s in the East Village, SING (monthly student sing-a-longs), the garden, the climbing wall, recess yard play stencils, the chickens (one month a year), alternative lunch menu, the Studio in a School art program, the library, newly added overnight farm trip for 3rd graders. \nCons - School trips are not impressive for a school in Manhattan, there are not enough or any cultural or museum trips. Trip suggestions are not encouraged or considered by teachers or principal. Communication from the teachers regarding your child\'s learning is minimal to none with the exception of weekly or biweekly class wide reports. It\'s hard to know if your child is progressing. No music instrument instruction, no proper dance room, the school is not very clean, rodent problem, the PTA/After school room is cluttered. New ideas come with a lot of push back. Lots of ""committees"" but too few parents attend meetings and not enough volunteers for activities/events.', 'Hi Jenny, your child\'s class might be the exception in regards to trips. My sons have been there for 4 years and all of those years they\'ve had countless trips to museums per year, as well as to other places like the Victory theater, ice skating, neighborhood walks to nearby museums. and countless other places. Also, I recieve weekly ""newsletters"" via email from both classes (I have sons in different classes) informing me about what they\'ve been working on and what they plan on doing next week. There has been a rodent problem but the school has been on top of it and keeping us posted via emails about the extermination process. In my opinion, I absolutely do not see/think the school is dirty. I can\'t speak to the rest that you\'ve mentioned as I haven\'t had any personal experiences and therefore can\'t have an opinion one way or another.', 'Hi, Thanks for sharing your experience. I do think it varies from classroom to classroom unfortunately. In two years we\'ve only gone to one museum (transit) but many trips to the park, beach, walks around the neighborhood which are great but think in this city with so many cultural institutions it\'s a shame some classes don\'t take advantage of them. For example last year a class in the same grade went to the Caulder exhibit at the Whitney per the suggestion of the art teacher but other classes didn\'t participate in that trip. Another class went to the Tenement museum but others did not. The DOE supports Victory theater so everyone does go at least once a year. So if you\'re lucky you\'ll get a teacher that will take advantage or what the city has to offer, if not then other student don\'t benefit from that educational experience and that\'s a lack of equality. I\'m one of a very small group of parents (4) that have been advocating aggressively for the rodent problem to be addressed. It\'s been a problem for years. While the exterminators were suppose to come over the summer and once a month they had not been doing that. They finally came a few weeks ago and because of again the small group of parents who have been sending countless emails to officials did some action start to happen. Mice are seen daily and caught only when traps are laid out. It\'s a MASSIVE project and we need parents to help and get involved. Officials from many departments and divisions finally came on Monday, not sure if you were there, to address the communication issues surrounding the plan of action. We all went to a classroom and like many, it was cluttered with stuff all along the walls and in the closets. Piles of stuff provide hiding places, nest sites, and secret travel routes for mice and rats. Clutter makes it difficult to clean, which further encourages rodents. I encourage you to visit all the classrooms and look all along the walls of the rooms. A parent said she saw a mouse in the classroom during a meeting with the teacher this past Friday just wandering about. An inspection of the stairwells showed holes along the walls with sightings of mouse hairs and droppings. If you saw the teachers report on daily sightings you\'d be horrified. This isn\'t all admins fault but unless more parents get involved in these issues they won\'t get resolved. The few parents are on top of it because even many teachers complaining to their union rep unfortunately it didn\'t push facilities to do anything. As far as communication, weekly school wide newsletters from the principal is AMAZING however classroom curriculum information in my experience has been a complete mystery. Reaching out to the science teacher about the curriculum resulted in a ""it\'s none of your business"" response. There\'s a lack of a collaborative spirit in some cases that is really unfortunate. A meeting surrounding literacy instruction happened today after so many parents complained about not knowing what literacy instruction looked like at the school or just didn\'t know what it was about and why some of their kids are falling so behind and parents not knowing or having the resources to do anything about it. There were about 30+ parents who showed up and the conversation will continue next month because while there was some clarity there are still a lot of unanswered questions.  But the good news is that we all now know finally that the school follows the ""BALANCED LITERACY"" approach or at least that\'s the philosophy however it\'s unclear if all the teachers know that or have the tools to apply the many tools in that approach that in the classroom.  The bottom line is there are many good things about the school and I think transparency on all it has to offer or doesn\'t will give parents a better picture as to whether it\'s a good fit for their child. It\'s a great school for self motivators and early readers but it may not work for kids to need more structure and explicit phonics based instruction along with other literacy education tools.', ""My children came to the Neighborhood School in Kindergarten and 2nd grade and we couldn't be happier with the school community, quality of teaching, and progressive education.

There are many field trips that supplement the in class instruction. I grew up not liking math however my daughters teacher has worked her magic and my daughter loves math! Its the first part of her homework that she wants to complete when she gets home. And the progressive education model helps my daughter learn so much without being bored or feeling like she is being forced to memorize useless facts. At times, she will surprise us with her knowledge of science or social studies. Beyond that, the school community is so warm and welcoming. The parents can be as involved with the school to a level that's manageable for their schedules. The kids sing to the parents in spanish and english once a mth at drop-off.

We could not be more pleased about the educational environment at this school. Education comes in many forms at this innovative place - it comes from the devoted and caring staff; it comes from the engaged and responsive administration; it comes from the active and creative parent community; and it comes from fellow students. What strikes me most about TNS is its focus on instilling a love of learning rather than cramming learning down students' throats with busywork and worksheets. I would not profess that there's a one size fits all educational style, but for my family this school has truly resonated. My children are happy to go to school every single day. They dread long vacations away from school and their friends. They are able to apply their coursework to everyday life. The school takes full advantage of its proximity to so many amazing landmarks. The group work in class fosters collaboration and provocative inquiry. The teachers spend time getting to know each student and assessing them in an authentic and meaningful way. Given today's high stakes testing culture, it's refreshing for elementary school kids to be inspired to actually want to learn and to be taught by professionals who value what it means to be a an educator, not a bureaucrat."", 'Many schools claim to be ""good schools"" but what parents need to understand is their definition of ""good"" and what the term is representative of. Neighborhood is not a good, school, it is a GREAT one. What makes it great is the commitment the teachers, administrators and parents put into building a community, recognizing that a child is more than a test score and creating an environment that appreciates what it means to learn and what the joy of teaching to children is all about. If you\'re looking for a school that measures success and progress in an authentic way and believes in the fundamentals of education, then consider ""TNS"". At TNS, teachers see themselves as partners in their kids\' learning and this is evident by the rich curriculum they develop and the myriad of ways they integrate the curriculum into everyday learning. While basics like reading, writing and math align to Common Core, the material is presented in a rich and engaging way so that children feel invested in the subject matter ,genuinely excited about learning and develop not just Common Core aligned knowledge, but the tools to be critical thinkers and social citizens of their community. Of note, TNS kids go on to very sought-after middle schools and do very well academically. What they learn in their early years are tools for academic and social-emotional well being that stay with them. From \'Blackboard Award\' winning teachers, to unique and enriching after-school programming offerings, this school is truly special and as a parent, I feel so lucky to be sending my kids here.', 'I am the parent of a 1st grade student at The Neighborhood School, and I could not be more impressed. TNS is a very special place. My son loves going to school and has grown academically and socially. The progressive model means that he learns while doing, and that has been wonderful to see. While his class has intensively studied architecture for the past two months, for example, he has learned new vocabulary, practiced spelling and writing, used math and early engineering skills, written stories, created artwork, read many books on the topic, and taken field trips to multiple famous landmark buildings. He is engaged and excited about learning. I am thrilled that TNS also offers a solid curriculum for reading, writing, and math. Plenty of physical activity is incorporated in to each school day. My son also goes outside of his classroom multiple times weekly for spanish instruction, science, art studio, library, and gym with specialized teachers. Every teacher at TNS is warm, engaging, and dedicated. The principal is smart, approachable, and clearly respected by both the parents and teachers. We are thrilled with our experience at TNS thus far, and we are looking forward to many more happy years at this school.', 'I am a parent of a current TNS student and a graduate, and I highly recommend The Neighborhood School to families looking for a progressive, caring and academically challenging school.

The culture and community of families at TNS is something very special - it is a very friendly, supportive and eclectic group of people that all care about helping to make the school a great place for our kids. Our experience has been overwhelmingly positive.', ""I entered this school in 2nd grade (I'm now in 8th grade) and was troubled, had a rocky 2nd grade year, and then was transformed by my fantastic 3rd grade teacher, Grace.

From pre-K through 5th grade, creative and passionate teachers helped him to see school as a daily adventure and the city as a lab for learning. He studied bugs, drew trees in the park, performed on stage, built elaborate structures, kept science logs, sang his little heart out, and developed a serious passion for math. The friends he made, and the experiences he had, have enriched our family to this day."", ""My daughter has been at the Earth School for several years and wakes up excited to go to school. She has thrived here and I'm so thrilled that she is having such a rich and varied experience. She tells me in detail about what she is learning in class, and though I know she is prepared academically to succeed at a more traditional school, I'm so happy that she is  growing up in a community that values the whole child. She loves having the opportunity to dance, cook, sing, garden, build, create, read to younger children, go on exciting trips, share her work with the whole school in Town Meeting, and be in mixed-age classes where she has the chance to look up to older children and then be the older child that others look up to. She has friends from a variety of cultures, income levels and academic levels, and has learned to respect and appreciate everyone and know them as the wonderful and imperfect people they are. I think the fact that so many teachers send their own children to the school shows that those who know the school best believe in its mission and the quality of education that the children receive. "", 'The principal at the Earth School Currently is not very friendly.\nShe can be confrontational and somewhat of a bully.\nIt was quite hurtful to my sons last year there.\nThough the school speaks about encouraging diversity, on the inside there is blatant segregation, a much less kinder and inviting energy from years prior. \nSeems as if other parents are afraid to speak up in fear that their children will be ill treated.

The teachers and staff are amazing; both diligent and nurturing. From my experience, Global Leaders is a small community who cares tremendously about the quality of education and relationships formed between us all (parents, teachers and students). The Dual Language Mandarin program happens to be a very instrumental part for us. I feel it offers versatility, diversity and an advantage for when the students prepare to enter High School. \nI want to give a special mention to Ms. Wang, my sons Mandarin teacher. She always go beyond what her duty entails and push my boys pass their comfort levels to ensure that they are at the top of their game and well prepared for the future.\n\n-Dawn Magee', 'I have had the privilege of being a parent at Global Leaders since 2014. My middle son began school there in 2014 and now my youngest daughter is a 7th grader. I remember when SGL was ""born"" and I was skeptical. I had an older son enter the 6th grade that year and I was skeptical just because they were so new and I didn\'t take the leap. Five years later, I was sure SGL was the right choice for my younger son, with small class size and project based learning. And never have I been happier with a school! My son left Global Leader to attend an elite boarding school in Pennsylvania as an Oliver Scholar. As he was leaving the school to move forward in his success, my daughter was entering the school into their Dual Language Mandarin program. Unfortunately, the end of my daughter\'s elementary school experience was not a very good one and academically she was suffering. She had gone from scoring 3 and 4 on the statewide test to scoring low 2s. And with the tutelage and dedication of the teachers at SGL my daughter went from low 2s to 4s on BOTH state exams. I could not have been happier. The faculty and staff at SGL reinvigorated her love for learning and their dedication to her success reminded her that she could believe in herself and succeed. Both of my SGL students were not only academically challenged, but they have benefited from the plethora of extra curricular activities available to them, both being involved in the many varsity sports available, art, choral music and theater. My daughter this year participated in the school rendition of The Lion King Jr and IT WAS PHENOMENAL!\n\nI have also spent most of the time as a parent at SGL serving on the Executive Board of the PTA. This year the PTA sponsored Career Day bringing 20 professionals from all walks of life and industries to share their work experience and educational experience with our students. Career Day was super successful enjoyed by teachers, students and presenters alike.\n\nAT SGL, we are a true family and believe in educating and supporting the whole child. I am so glad that both my youngest children have had an opportunity to share in this community. It was definitely the BEST choice we could have made. My son was WELL prepared for his journey to high school. As my daughter rises to the 8th grade, I have no doubt she will be well prepare for whatever her high school journey will be.', 'Last year I was told that my daughters school was merging into Global Leader I was so worried. Miah is graduating this year and I have to say thanks to all the teachers in Global. Miah always had issues with math, in Global she actually learned her math and enjoyed it.

Since the first day of SGL they wanted us to get ready for the real world and what we students are going to face. In 7th and 6th grade I did not really know as much but the teachers helped me get to where the spot i am at right now.

Mr. Berkowitz has been asked several times at Coffee with the Principal and PTAs meetings why he took out languages and he is never been able to offer a clear response and does not even want to talk about it. And yes, there is friction between teachers and him, because like in the language case, his decisions are pretty arbitrary as he acts without considering suggestions and recommendations from the teachers, who are the ones who really have experience in many of the topics he is considering.

There's music and art, and upper grades have dance. Recess every day, playground is nice enough, and they have the required gym twice a week.

From my personal experience as a student who knows Lisa, test scores are most certainly at the bottom, or nonexistent on her list. She takes the time to fully get to know each individual student, when I come back to visit, she recognizes me and engages in specific conversation about how I am doing. I don't have and IEP or any sort of learning disability, but I do know that students like this were treated equally, and as fairly as possible. It is most definitely the right decision to send your child here."", ""I have a student graduating this year and one in Pre-K. This entire year I've been so impressed by the rigor of the material and activities and the joyous and social atmosphere of the classrooms. The teachers, administrators and parents work together to make this an academic, artistic, socially conscious community that both of my children are flourishing in."", ""My child recently received a promotion in doubt letter, and from what I understand, Lisa uses the Teacher's College Reading Level Benchmarks as the sole criteria for holdover. She refuses to consider a student's IEP, emotional well being or if being raised in a bilingual household. What can us parents do?"", ""Sadly, the principal has been using holdover at what appears to be an unusually high rate and more and more kids and families each year are hurt by it. If you have questions, you won't get support because she has forbidden the staff from talking about holdover.  I have heard from many parents that she is not likely to have a full, detailed discussion about it with them either so they are left wondering why their kids, many of whom are not failing, are being hurt like this. Avoid PS 3 if you can."", ""Something is off in PS 3! The school administration is weirdly pro-holdover, and I am starting to wonder why.  Could it be that kids with lower grades or lower scores are messing up the school’s stats?  Could holding the child back help them hide the lower stat?  Whatever is happening, more and more families are feeling betrayed and frustrated by the school’s very forceful approach, insisting on holdover as a one-size-fits-all solution for vastly different kids with issues ranging from minor to major.  \n\nI have two extremely different kids at two totally different ends of the spectrum as far as learning (one very bright and very mature but unfocused, one with processing issues and not as mature but very focused), and the school threatened to hold back my one child last year and my other one this year!  The worst of it is that in both cases I asked for my kids to be tested or have special help, and the teachers spent the first half of the school year saying no to testing and demanding that I fix the problem at home.  I do spend a lot of time working with my kids, reading to them, doing art projects, practicing a little math, all the good stuff as time for a busy working single mom permits.  I did work hard with my older child at home last year and was very happy with her progress.  But then last February the teacher told my child she'd be held back WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST.  She came home hysterically crying and confused.  Only when I wrote a very angry letter and asked it to be put in her file did they send a holdover letter, but the principal would not meet with me.  I must have called for an appointment twenty times before giving up. Then I started putting everything in writing.  I asked for more scaffolding (good for my child and all the kids!) and tried to get assignments and units in advance so I could help do the scaffolding myself.  The teacher was unable to give me these tools or to show me what strategies she was using to reach not only my kid but all the kids in the class who might need extra help.  \n\nThe teacher dangled holdover over my child’s head the rest of that semester, really threatening her with it whenever she did anything wrong or didn’t succeed at something academically, until she hated school and had zero self-confidence left.  Finally at the very end of the year they invited me to a meeting, made me wait for a week without telling me what the meeting was about until both my child and I were ready to snap with the pressure.  I had to bring a friend to the meeting because I was afraid I would cry or lose it or both.  I brought a list of 60 learning strategies for kids with poor focus so that I could ask the teacher which, if any, she had used, though I knew she had probably not used one.  The meeting seemed more like a chance for them to save face than to be a team working together for the child.  But at least they told me they would “allow” her to go to the next grade, so I put my list of strategies away and our family was released from the terrible tension and pressure that destroyed my child’s belief in her own abilities.  Only this year was she able to rebuild that confidence and start to achieve -- and finally to get extra help for focus problems with SETTS teachers.\n\nWith my next child, who I knew had real special learning needs, I was determined not to let that happen.  I asked for testing on the first day of school, and was put off until December.  Finally the slow process fell into place, the testing was undertaken by the really amazing IEP team.  (And by the way, the IEP team is AMAZING, but I get the sense the team is severely limited in what they can do and how far they can go as advocates.)  Finally we met with all his teachers and the IEP team to discuss his diagnosed disability and to come up with a plan for his future, a supportive and wonderful plan that took into account his gifts and his needs and would put him in an ICT class next fall but leave him with his current class this year where he was so happy, but offer support with pull outs with a reading and speech specialist a few times per week.  I was told that he had real needs in ONE area but was otherwise average or above in terms of national standards.  I was feeling really good about everything and even about the school for the first time.  I taught him subtraction over the vacation, and was so proud that he got it even though his class hadn’t started it yet.  \n\nBut a week later, I get handed a holdover letter by the teacher who had just been in the meeting advocating for my child!  I felt so betrayed!  What was the point of developing this wonderful plan and recognizing my child’s needs and designing an approach to help him succeed, including an ICT class for the fall, if they were just going to threaten to fail him instead of undertaking the great work we had agreed upon?  All the trust I had in his teacher and the school was dissolved in an instant. \n\nThen I began asking around, and I learned that many families are facing the same problem and had almost the same experience across the board.\n\nI have done a lot of reading about this, and there is no research that proves that holdover is an effective strategy for most kids at whatever level of risk.  There are ZILLIONS of academic journals featuring articles DISPROVING the efficacy of holdover.  Effective strategies are found in the IEP approach and differentiated learning.  They REALLY work.  And they feed kids' belief in themselves and their ability to learn strategies that will help them for life.\n\nIn both cases, in all areas but one, my kids tested average or above average according to the IEP team’s very thorough testing program.  In both cases, my kids  made massive strides from September to December.  But it wasn’t fast enough for the administration at PS 3.  The standards at PS 3 are not the national average, but the Greenwich Village average.  None of the teachers we've had so far offer after-school tutoring, not even one day a week; instead many parents shell out big bucks for private tutors, kumon, music/art teachers, etc., to keep up -- or rather, to get ahead!  As a result, the level of achievement considered normal goes even higher, a C becomes too shocking (even if, for parents like me, a C is really okay!).  For kids not above the PS 3 average, the school forgets all about the idea of nurturing the whole child, forgets the many types of learning styles our kids may bring to the table, forgets the true power of the arts, whatever their website may say.  The parents here are amazing, they do so much as volunteers and to bring in great programs and raise money to pay for them.  There are also some amazing teachers here.  But as far as really valuing the whole child and training the teachers to use a variety of strategies to reach all kids, as far as holding ALL teachers to the best practices of student-centered learning and differentiated instruction, as far as seeing family and staff as a team working together to help each child reach his/her full potential, my experience has not been a good one.  "", 'This school breaks educational, legal, and moral codes/laws  in order to minimizes  the chances of students bringing test scores down in 3rd grade.    Instead  of creating better educational opportunities to meet the students needs, it embraces a punitive approach by holding children back.  Most of the students that are held back are in 1 and 2 nd grade.  In fact this school is know as the HOLD OVER SCHOOL.  Children who have English as a second language are legally not allowed to repeat grades. However, at this school many children who speak another language at home and receive ESL are held over.   Their parents ihave no voice in the process. The decisions were made unilaterally by the head of the school .  Research proves that holding kids back is creating long term academic and emotional damage.  So why is this school choosing this path so easily?   We have two children at this school, both have received Hold Over  letters in  Feb.    It is as if we the parents are warned that we are not doing a good job educating our children.  It is heartbreaking!! The principal  shows no collaboration if parents want to meet with her.  She does not want to meet with concerned parents who want to question her decisions.   How serious is the  DOE taking this matter at PS 3 and what will they do about it? \n\n  It is very imperative that this very serious issue is being questioned by parents.

I'm not usually prone to posting comments but, having read some of the earlier posts, I think it is important to offer a different perspective. I genuinely believe that the concerns are misplaced.\n\n\nMy child entered PS3 in kindergarten and has been in CTT/ICT classes throughout. Yes, the classroom atmosphere in the earlier years might have been lighter and more carefree. Yes, the teachers in the 4th grade might have more rules and run a tighter ship. Candidly, we considered a move to private school to avoid the 4th grade class based on what I now view as unfounded doubts. In the end, I am very glad we stayed at PS3 and very pleased with both 4th grade ICT teachers. My sense, watching the class, teachers and students closely, is that the atmosphere is appropriate for the age group and certainly nurturing when necessary.\n\n\nMake no mistake: I am not a gung-ho PS3 cheerleader. I have spent many days in the office and with the school administrative staff advocating for my child and expressing dissatisfaction with how the school is managed in some areas, such as too many indoor recesses and subpar bathrooms. PS3 has its share of problems, but I'm sure it is not alone among New York City schools. For all of its faults, they are greatly outweighed by the benefits of PS3, many of which have been expressed in comments below.\n\n\nIn the end, a child is lucky to be a student at PS3, including one in the 4th grade ICT class. The child's parents are lucky, too. And grateful."", 'The dirty secret of PS3 is that in the early years (K-3) it seems like everything you want a school to be - creative, fun, unstructured, parent-friendly; but by grades 4 and 5 you realize that the kids are learning absolutely NOTHING.  No math, no grammar, no history, not even the MONTHS OF THE YEAR (I am not kidding - I had to teach this to my kids on my own).  My two kids went here and even with very different skills, strengths, and learning styles, they both demonstrate a shocking lack of basic education.  The math education in particular is a problem because while it seems like a great idea to emphasize ""concepts"", if they don\'t learn basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication (not to mention long division which they only seem to cover in one week), your child will never, ever catch up. (You find this out when you apply to the more competitive middle schools like LAB and Salk.) And beware the administration: once you voice any sort of complaint, you are effectively blacklisted...', 'As an actual student from PS3, I believe that this school definitely prepares use for middle school. We learned addition, subtraction, and multiplication before third grade, as well as basic fractions, geometry and algebra. Long division is taught as an alternative to simple visualizations, as ps3 stresses the importance\nof models and fully understanding the material. While I am not a parent, I have no say on the administrative experience, of course, and some of the homework assignments were a bit indirect and excessive. In fifth grade especially the different classes had vastly different homework loads. My brother and I are 7 th graders in Salk, along with several others from ps3, and many incoming 6 th graders are from ps 3 as well.  I will admit that the school could’ve done a better job with the science program, but I think that the school is very well-rounded and it prepared me for  middle school .', 'A note for parents of special needs kids:  PS3 has been amazing in this regard for our family. PS3 has many many CTT classes and they also offer 12:1:1 (which are 100% special Ed) for parents that feel a smaller, more restrictive class with more adults helping is necessary. PS3 is extremely pro-active and supportive of special needs. They\'ve always approached my child as an individual and not just a collection of diagnosis\'...My child also receives speech, Ot and pt.  I\'ve never had to ""fight"" for services at this school.  There is also a special on-site autism spectrum support staff for Asd related issues - they support teachers by pushing in to classrooms and offering tips on helpful behavioral interventions, etc. I have been very happy with the overall support and regularly meet SN parents at other schools that remark on our experience as being other than the norm and something for which we should be grateful. The school based support team (psychologist, social worker and parent outreach) is amazing.  The teachers and therapist are available to meet most Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. I\'m always a little confused that PS3 retains its rep as the ""less structured school"" as compared to ps41 for example. I think this is a holdover from hippie days perhaps :) Because when you walk down the halls during class time it\'s extremely quiet and looking into classrooms you see tidy spaces filled with kids busily working.  An non-chaotic environment is extremely important to me for my child - I would never have enrolled here if it seemed too ""laid back""...also, I have friends at 41 who have described it as being none too encouraging of parent involvement. This doesn\'t really work for many parents of special needs kids - so I\'m very relieved we were able to get placement at 3 before zoning changed (we are now zoned for 41).  My one negative is that the principal is not great with parents - but because she obviously runs such a tight ship and employs such a great staff and support services - its not really been a problem as we\'ve always gotten what we need from the staff.   There is also a special needs parent support group every other Thursday in the parent lounge.', 'To any parent reading this who has a child on the special needs side and who is zoned for PS41, please be assured that 41 is very supportive of their IEP and ICT special needs families. Their OT, speech and SETs teachers are excellent. I have 2 kids that attend 41 and I have no complaints about how we were supported as a special needs family, quite the opposite. Services were provided with ease and without judgment The criticism of a lack of parent involvement that is so often leveled at 41 also leaves me scratching my head. We have had monthly family mornings for both kids in every grade! The PS41 parents are extremely active from raising $$$ for the PTA to providing a music curriculum for the kids via a parent run music committee. Hearsay about either school merely fuels some outdated and ludicrous rivalry between what are essentially two excellent schools in district 2. It is trite, pointless and does not help allay the fears and concerns of special needs families.', 'Hi. You child must young,...at least younger than fourth grade. That may be your experience now, but when you get to the fourth grade ICT class, and encounter the male ICT teacher, you might change your mind. He is the opposite of supportive or nurturing, he\'s very abrasive, sarcastic, and sometimes hostile (needles to say not the best fit for a child with any kind of special needs). The atmosphere in his classroom is not conducive to learning. When my child was in his class, he was emotionally abusive, to the point that my child went way downhill and become depressed. I\'ve spoken to both parents and teachers alike, who\'ve collaborated my viewpoint, at least off the record, and I know I\'m not alone in this opinion. P.S.3 is overall a good school, I don\'t know why they have such a volatile and angry teacher, particularly in an ICT class. Bottom line,...if your child makes it to fourth grade, and he\'s not one of the ""favorites"", run, don\'t walk to another setting!', 'While I\'m sorry to hear that you had an experience that felt as you described it, I couldn\'t disagree with you more and feel that it\'s important to raise a different perspective. Our experience with the teacher you mention has been nothing but positive. Claiming that someone is ""emotionally abusive"" is a heavy statement; I\'m not disputing your experience but I find it very hard to believe that he was ""emotionally abusive"" by any clinical definition. To ""PS3mom"" below and anyone else who reads the post above, I hope you allow yourself to make your own decisions about this educator. I have seen him do amazing things.', ""That's fine, if that's been your experience with him. When my child was in his class, he was inappropriate, called him names, and embarrassed and ostracized him from his peers, by publicilly singling him out, because of his learning differences. Academically, he was very heavy on test prep, and my child's book club was only assigned two (relatively short) books throughout the whole school year!

02M006,"[""Agree with the poster below.  PS6 has a group of dynamic and dedicated educators but in the years we've been there, we've watched as one after another have left for other schools.  Teachers who are engaged and beloved by parents seem to be shunned by the administration, perhaps in an attempt to level the playing field.  Often they are replaced by newer teachers, some of whom are also terrific but also head for the hills after a few years.  There is a huge emphasis placed on testing (and the accolades it brings like the mediocre Blue Ribbon award).  Test prep and teaching to the test are evident in every grade. However, PS6 seems to  change curriculum (especially math) almost every year which hardly gives faculty and children enough time to learn and/or see if it will be successful. Large amounts of money are dedicated to the ever-changing curriculum ideas, dollars that could be spent lowering the class size of 33 (in 1st grade and up) or replacing all the specials that have been cut in the last few years. Due to the huge size of classes and the curriculum, the children are memorizing and repeating back much of the day and children who have issues with this kind of learning are dealt with as behavior problems and singled out. The Principal is defensive and has a reputation for playing favorites.   Many families who would have previously moved to be a part of the PS6 zone seem to be moving to PS290 or 267 instead.  The school does have nice facilities- including a separate gym, library and auditorium and the PE and Science programs are highlights.

I have heard over and over again that a donation will get you the class and teacher you like best.

Any insights appreciated.\n\nOur older kid is going into K next year. We are zoned for PS6 and have an offer to PS33 G&T. I\'m trying to think about the value of having a 5-10 minute walk to school (not to mention a school that is, according to most folks, a very good school with an incredible fundraising machine attached to it, involved parents, motivated kids, no potential G&T/gen-ed rift, the ability to have 92Y after school pick her up directly from PS6, etc.) vs. a 45-60 minute bus ride (each way) to a (again, according to most folks) strong G&T program -- i.e. having her surrounded ""only"" by G&T peers -- with excellent exmissions, probably better than PS6\'s at the margins. That\'s judging based on public school exmissions -- based on what the PS33 Open House shared and what can be found on the DOE website for the top 5 middle schools that PS6 feeds, that\'s my understanding thus far. Candidly, I haven\'t gotten much information on private exmissions for either program yet. (I don\'t know if our goal is public or private middle/high school. I think we just want to maximize optionality at this point, who knows what school will be the best place for her later on yet?) It seems to me that both PS6 and PS33 G&T are successful because of very involved parents. I\'ve been told that my kid will be happy at PS6 and thrive there by educators who know her well. I don\'t know that a single kid from her preschool has ever gone to PS33 G&T. So we\'re just sort of flying a bit blind here.\n\nWhich leads me to: I\'d love to hear from anyone who made the decision (either way) between these two programs -- what motivated the choice and how has the decision played out for your kid(s)/family? If you are willing to have a conversation offline, even better.\n\nAlso, my understanding is that if we register for PS33 G&T then our PS6 registration gets blown away and is then likely filled by someone on the PS6 K waitlist -- so if PS33 G&T turns out to be something besides what we hope it to be during K... then there\'s unlikely to be a path back to PS6 until 1st grade.

Now I’ve had friends who told me they dreaded ICT and it turned out amazing when their kid landed in the ICT class. I have no idea how difficult an ICT class may be to manage in a worst case scenario. But one thing you generally know in G&T anywhere is you won’t have ICT.

02M033,"[""Our child attended pre-k at PS 33 during the 2018-19 school year. We were happy with the experience. Both of the pre-k teachers last year (there are two pre-k classes) were highly experienced and deeply invested in their students, and many of the kids, including ours, formed close bonds with their teachers. Our child's teacher did a great job being warm and caring while also helping our child correct some problematic behaviors and get ready for kindergarten, which seems like a hard balance to strike. The teachers also seemed to work hard to differentiate instruction for the kids based on their individual readiness, though with 18 kids at a wide range of developmental stages, there were no doubt some days where this worked better than others. \n\nThere were many opportunities for parental involvement in the pre-k classes -- the usual run of holiday and birthday parties, but also monthly 'craft mornings' (in which parents could sign up to come in and do a craft or activity with the kids), a parent-child dance performance, one-off classroom demonstrations (e.g., a parent who came in to teach yoga to the kids), and so on. At least once a month we were in the classroom for one thing or another, and we appreciated those opportunities. The pre-k classes also take a lot of field trips: they went to the Atlantic Theater (twice), the marionette show at the Swedish Cottage, the New York Botanical Garden, the Bronx Zoo, and Sesame Street Live. Our kid loved these.\n\nThere were a few things we weren't wild about, but nothing major: 1) As is the case with many NYC schools, the building could stand to be renovated if not replaced entirely. 2) In an ideal world, there would be a class website or a weekly email or something that explained what was happening that week, how we could reinforce our child's learning that week at home, and so on. The teachers were always good about sharing that information if we asked, and of course they have plenty on their plates with what's happening in the classroom, but given how difficult it can be to get accurate information from four-year-olds about how they spent their days, having those details up front seems like it would help parents work with the teachers a little more. \n\nOn the whole, we think the pre-k program here is a good choice and have recommended to several other parents."", '<a href=""http://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/5334-PS6-vs.-PS33-G-amp-T"">PS6 vs. PS33 G&T thread on theschoolboards</a>.  Cross-posting here as you never know where people have made accounts and where they haven\'t.  Will also cross-post to the PS6 InsideSchools comments section too.  Any insights appreciated.\n\nOur older kid is going into K next year. We are zoned for PS6 and have an offer to PS33 G&T. I\'m trying to think about the value of having a 5-10 minute walk to school (not to mention a school that is, according to most folks, a very good school with an incredible fundraising machine attached to it, involved parents, motivated kids, no potential G&T/gen-ed rift, the ability to have 92Y after school pick her up directly from PS6, etc.) vs. a 45-60 minute bus ride (each way) to a (again, according to most folks) strong G&T program -- i.e. having her surrounded ""only"" by G&T peers -- with excellent exmissions, probably better than PS6\'s at the margins. That\'s judging based on public school exmissions -- based on what the PS33 Open House shared and what can be found on the DOE website for the top 5 middle schools that PS6 feeds, that\'s my understanding thus far. Candidly, I haven\'t gotten much information on private exmissions for either program yet. (I don\'t know if our goal is public or private middle/high school. I think we just want to maximize optionality at this point, who knows what school will be the best place for her later on yet?) It seems to me that both PS6 and PS33 G&T are successful because of very involved parents. I\'ve been told that my kid will be happy at PS6 and thrive there by educators who know her well. I don\'t know that a single kid from her preschool has ever gone to PS33 G&T. So we\'re just sort of flying a bit blind here.\n\nWhich leads me to: I\'d love to hear from anyone who made the decision (either way) between these two programs -- what motivated the choice and how has the decision played out for your kid(s)/family? If you are willing to have a conversation offline, even better.\n\nAlso, my understanding is that if we register for PS33 G&T then our PS6 registration gets blown away and is then likely filled by someone on the PS6 K waitlist -- so if PS33 G&T turns out to be something besides what we hope it to be during K... then there\'s unlikely to be a path back to PS6 until 1st grade. But this isn\'t yet confirmed with DOE directly. Would love to know if anyone has knowledge/experience with this sort of situation and how it plays out.\n\nI have heard the 33 bus can run very late at times — like well past 4pm on particularly bad days. Not often but just the sort of thing to stress you out in a way that being local never would. Would love to hear from any UES PS33 parents about how their kids’ after school activities are and how often the bus messes things up. Is this a real issue or not?\n\nOne parent suggested 33 is downside protection in the sense that you aren’t as likely to run into parents with a different educational philosophy and you aren’t going to land an ICT class. Now I’ve had friends who told me they dreaded ICT and it turned out amazing when their kid landed in the ICT class. I have no idea how difficult an ICT class may be to manage in a worst case scenario. But one thing you generally know in G&T anywhere is you won’t have ICT. I don’t know how much that’s really worth in terms of “downside protection” however. Would love to hear from anyone who has thoughts on ICT especially at PS6.', 'Hi! I am in he exact same situation. What have you decided? Were you able to get answers to your questions? I share most of them!', 'Hi there, congratulations to your kid on the G&T offer.  We chose PS33 G&T.\n\nI may not address all the questions I laid out above, because the primary reason for our decision was something I didn\'t identify well in the initial post: teacher quality.  Of course, teachers are a huge part of what makes a good school, so it seems odd to have not zeroed in on them directly from the start.  Of course, teachers come and go, but it sounds like PS33 G&T has good teachers based on the program\'s build-out, and it has made good new hires over time.  Good teachers seems like an easier factor to be more confident in, rather than some of the other items in my initial post (many of which are ""driven"" -- at least in part -- by teacher quality, and many of which depend a lot on class composition, which obviously has many moving pieces [kids] in any given year).\n\nAll the parents at PS33 G&T consistently said very good things about the teacher quality there.  So once we focused on teachers, and since it\'s even harder to get a G&T slot in NYC after K (based on historical data, at least), we decided to try it.  The other major driver was focusing on the worst case scenario: K is a tough year (for whatever reason(s)), and we can\'t get back to PS6 for K (for whatever reason(s)), so we go back to PS6 for 1st grade.  That\'d be a hard year... but it\'s also just a year.\n\nWhat ""data"" did we have for this?  We were able to meet some teachers at PS33 G&T for short Q&As during the open house and at the school Carnival -- we liked them.  We weren\'t able to meet teachers at PS6.  That said, most of what we learned about both schools came from other parents\' experiences, as relayed to us.\n\nI\'m emphatically <i>not</i> saying that I heard PS6 doesn\'t have plenty of good teachers.  Most parents I spoke with at PS6 said quite the opposite.  Relative to PS33 G&T, there was perhaps just a little more anecdotal ""well, this <i>one</i> year, I didn\'t love this <i>one</i> particular teacher.""  (I should again note that in some cases, even if the parent(s) didn\'t love a particular teacher, my recollection is they\'d often add that their kid seemed to like the teacher in question just fine, and the comment was really about how the parent felt about his or her interactions with the teacher.  I think the chances of loving all your kids teachers aren\'t particularly great, no matter what school you\'re talking about -- it just seemed like we might have a little better odds at PS33 G&T.\n\nThere\'s also a pretty decent-sized UES population at PS33 G&T, which gave us comfort that 1) local playdates, while obviously not as easy to do as they would be at PS6, are a reasonable expectation, and 2) the odds of having carpool options for after-school pickups are greater.\n\nThe costs are clear -- the commute is long.  The benefits seemed somewhat intangible, but became more tangible when we focused on teacher quality.  The good news is both options are strong choices.\n\nFor whatever it\'s worth, I strongly suggest contacting Shannon, the incoming PS33 PTA president.  She\'s extremely helpful and can get you in touch with plenty of other families and you can ask whatever questions you like.  Best of luck with your decision.', ""We recently got an invitation to join the 1st grade G&T program.

02M051,"[""We have been in PS51 for 6 years -my older daughter entered as a K student and my son as PK. We picked this school immediately after a school tour out of all the schools we visited (include gift & talent programs) because we loved the building and had a very positive feeling about the teachers and staff here. And we were right- everyone CARES so much for the students in this school! Principal Lukas has been here only 2 years but she has made so many great improvements to the School and to the students's academic life. For examples- she knows every single student's name after a year(!); and that she brought in the STEM program to the entire school this year after parents raised the points that our school lacks a good STEM program in the past. Every teachers my kids have has been phenomenal -some were tough or old fashion but they just love and care so much for their students -you can just tell by the ways they interact with your children in and out of classes, or they make special effort to individual student who may a little attention or help. All the supporting staff, even the security guards, know and watch out for your children  in every corner of  this school so they are in a very safe and lovely environment. Currently my daughter is in 5th grade and I am very proud to say that she plays 4 musical instruments (all from school), has all 4's in state tests,  also joins the Fashion Club and Girls Who Code clubs. My son is only in first grade but he is already showing exceptional talents in math, art and dance. I am not bragging but just wanted to show you that an average normal kid can strive and benefit from this exceptional amazing loving school!"", 'We transferred to PS 51 from a local charter school when my girls were entering 4th and 2nd grades. It was the most terrifying decision I had made in a very long time.  I had one child with multiple learning disabilities although she was very bright and capable and both were struggling with their self-esteem. We had already gone through so many academic struggles that I wasn\'t sure if entering into a new academic environment would help or hurt. It turned out to be the best decision I could have made. I watched both of their self-esteems skyrocket. They were welcomed into the school like old friends and the teachers and administration were truly welcoming and supportive. The biggest up side for us was the numerous performing arts, STEM and other arts-based instructions that are embedded in the school day that finally gave my kids the balance they desperately needed vs. nonstop academic pressure. Today, my older one is flourishing thanks to amazing support from the SETTS teacher, guidance counselor and her teachers and my 3rd grader has really taken off academically and behaviorally and has an absolutely fabulous teacher. Coming from a highly structured, competitive academic environment, there are some very different academic approaches that took me time to get used to but once I spent time learning about their approach and the thought-process behind it I\'ve been able to embrace it and really leverage the different learning programs. My now 5th grader earned 4s on all of her state exams last year which was very important to us for middle school applications. The principal is absolutely amazing. She is extremely present throughout the day, deeply involved in the curriculum, highly available to her teachers and parents and just genuinely and profoundly cares about the children at every level. The teachers are incredibly compassionate and work together to help children succeed and when there is need for discipline it is done with compassion and understanding while still achieving the needed disciplinary results. The school has done a terrific job of ramping up their communications, now incorporating weekly emails, texts when needed, regular updates on their FB page, an APP and most classroom teachers (I believe all but not sure) use the Remind App to communicate directly with parents which is phenomenal and was a goal of the PTA and principal last year. Finally, the PTA is wonderful and work incredibly hard to bring the ""extras"" to the schools that are actually part of the foundation that makes PS 51 what it is. Monthly PTA meetings where your feedback and suggestions are actually valued and incorporated whenever possible is fantastic and the principal, vice principal and parent coordinator actually attend the meetings, speak and take questions. PS  51 is an absolute gem of a school. While I don\'t regret our time in a charter school because of the choices we had at the time, if I had the choice of a school like PS 51 for Kindergarten, I wouldn\'t have even hesitated.', 'My child came to PS 51 in 4th grade.  We were welcomed by a genuine teacher, principal and entire staff who cared about our family.  The staff listens to the families and does everything possible to ensure that children are happy and safe.  The school is beautiful.  It has 2 gyms.  Besides the FANTASTIC music instructor, there is also a dance teacher on staff.  There are many after school programs.  One of note is the Fashion Club, taught by the school art teacher who went to FIT.  At the end of 5th grade, the kids put on a HUGE Project Runway type show.  It is phenomenal.  The recorder club, chorus club, science and coding clubs are also phenomenal.  They also have a rooftop garden.  Science classes use the space sometimes in their curriculum.  My child will miss this school I know when she goes on to middle school.  And I will too! Oh and my child was performing below grade level at another school in 3rd grade.  Now at PS 51 she is on grade level in every class and sometimes above grade level.  She has a real interest in learning at this school.', ""After 4 years at PS51, we are strong advocates for families in our community taking advantage of this fantastic school.

They work well with the Administration to ensure that our children experience excellent educational curriculum in a supportive environment. The needs of each child are valued.\n\nThe Science program has a great lab, and the Arts programs are top notch. Art and Music boast two of the best teachers in the City. In addition to a Physical Education teacher, they also have a dance teacher! I love the emphasis on the WHOLE child - academic enrichment and creative endeavors.\n\nNow, let's talk about the facilities: Ten Stars! It's a new building, with a VERY protected play yard. Plus, there's a rooftop garden where the children get to plant and harvest. \n\nAnd the After School Care options? Loads. We participate in the program that uses the school building after school. That program brings in a reading specialist for those who are struggling, in addition to their programming which includes homework help, chess, tennis, art clubs, music lessons (violin and piano for my child), and so much more.\n\nFinal Analysis: This school is a neighborhood gem. Don't miss your opportunity to be part of the community."", ""My daughter is currently enrolled in PreK at PS51.  She can't wait to go to school every day - her teacher is brilliant, kind, and always has a fun activity happening in the class.

My daughter also has an IEP, and I have been very pleased with how her services has been fulfilled.

If he does the same, he should have his choice of Middle Schools next year.  We have added drum lessons to the continuing violin at home.  At school he loves science club and thanks to weekly lessons (available to all students and led by quite possibly the single-most amazing music teacher in the city), he is now adept at playing the ukulele, guitar, recorder, a plethora of percussion instruments and is developing his below-average singing voice in the weekly chorus..The previous principal who was inspiring, nurturing and progressive has sadly retired and been replaced by another who is inspiring, nurturing, progressive, innovative, open-minded, efficient and seemingly boundless in what he is able to accomplish in every 24 hours he shreds.

Yeah, we kinda like Elias Howe.', ""Our sons attend pre-K in Mrs Rivas' class. She is INCREDIBLE - patient, caring, loving, creative, and somehow finds time to truly impact every one of her students. The school is brand new and well-equipped. The teachers are passionate and the parents are getting involved (average PTA meeting has 50+ attendees).

Just seeing the way the kids embrace each other in the playgrounds tells you what a special place it is.

We chose to send our son to PS51 last year for Kindergarten and it was one of the best decisions we could have made. I was nervous as all his friends went elsewhere but I had such a good feeling about 51 that I stuck to my guns and I am thrilled that I did.\n\nMy son did so well in that class and excelled in all his subjects. I love that he gets an all round experience in this school ( social,emotional and educational ) with a lot of outstanding (and award winning)  art and music. However for those who worry about academics, he was reading two levels above his grade level by Spring and they always kept him challenged and excited about reading. He enjoyed 'shopping' for books in Grade2! He started K only knowing a few words so this was their doing with a little help from him :) They differentiate the teaching to an amazing standard so that there are always at least 3-4 different level groups in maths and English. Even the homework is differentiated and the kids come home with different homework packets depending on their own personal level. What I like most about this, is the children don't even realize they are in different leveled groups. There is none of this 'I'm in the top group' rubbish that we had as kids.\n\nThey had a lovely activity in K where a kids name was picked out of a hat, they got to sit in the special chair and their peers were encouraged to give them compliments about what they did well in class and/or for each other. Children are really encouraged to love and help each other at 51 and you can really feel that throughout the school. This is modeled so well by the staff who you can clearly see love their children and want the very best out of them.\n\nYou can see above what a wonderful review inside schools gave them, but they also have recently won many fantastic awards for which they so deserve.\n\nPlease take time to visit the school ( I went to at least 3 tours !). Try to also make one of the open house sessions, the next one is 22 December 2015. The teachers get to explain what they do and why and you can ask lots of questions.\n\nI have had nothing but good experiences with the Principal and Vice Principal. They are very open and responsive to anything I have suggested which is a great plus for the school. \n\nI don't think anyone will tell you that their school is perfect, there is always room for improvement, but I know PS51 in my opinion is brilliant.

The chess awards are results of commitments from students and parents. By the way, chess is not a curriculum here, unlike some other public schools. Chess here is purely a afterschool program kids have to sign up for. The principal even abandoned the parents from participating in the chess afterschool ceremony this year. Disappointed but not surprised.', 'This is not true. K students have 24 weeks of chess as part of the enrichment curriculum.

However, I can feel the pain of other parents who are so frustrated and disappointed by what happened to this school in recent years.

It\'s as if you\'re blaming her for filing a role that needed filling!    \n\n\n\nYes, some of our teachers leave for awesome opportunities -- our 5th grade teacher, for example, took a job minutes from home (instead of continuing at Lab with a lengthy commute).  Mrs. Miller does her absolute BEST to hire to brightest minds and best fits for our kids.  We currently have one of the new teachers and we are all thrilled with her!', 'It is uncommonly high turnover in this school. Let’s face it.\n\nSad to see people tend to cover things up with excuses instead of solving problems.', 'I\'d like to take this opportunity to correct some of the misinformation in the previous posts.  It pains me to see people who don\'t know much about their children\'s school and are not even involved in any way, but feel that they have the authority to speak on behalf of an entire parent body.  First of all, music is not provided to Lower Lab by the DOE.  Our PTA raises money through fundraisers, generosity of parents and affiliates, and parent volunteers who spend hours per week devoted to this school.  The current music teacher is currently in her second year and teaches orchestra, Chorus, recorder, and vocal music.  She is very impressive.  The previous music teacher WAS wonderful and was in the process of obtaining her PhD.  When she received it, she decided to work in academia.  It was not a surprise.  We were lucky to have her and we are lucky to have the current music teacher.  \nThe science teacher was 72 years old and had been at the school for over 30 years.  She actually delayed retirement because she loved the school so much, but ultimately decided to retire last year.  She has been replaced by a smart, enthusiastic, dynamic, and fresh new teacher who has connected with the students in just two weeks.  \nI have had two students at this school and have been active here for six years.  My children each had a teacher who was new to the school in the past two years and received the highest level of education, compassion, and support.  They felt challenged, encouraged, and cared for.  Their friends are amazing and I, myself, have made close friends as a result.  Our families are terrific and our administration can\'t be beat.  Our Parent Coordinator, Gina Goodman, goes above and beyond in every way possible and is a true superstar.  Our Asst Principal, Denise Perez, is a true professional in every sense of the word and makes every student and parent feel comfortable and secure at Lower Lab.  Sandra Miller, in her fifth year as Principal, has made tremendous progress at Lower Lab.  She has implemented an entire curriculum based upon social-emotional learning, which has resulted in a true ""community"" feeling.  She has secured a new playground, new air-conditioning in the building, new windows, a refurbished facade outside the building, and a technology room full of robotics and computers.  That\'s a lot to accomplish in just four years.  \nIn terms of middle school placement, almost every student received their first or second choice in the past two years.  The ones who didn\'t continued on to gifted and talented programs within other middle schools and feel proud to have been accepted there.  \nStudents in grades 1-5 currently participate in Latin, with a seasoned, exciting teacher who will now provide continuity across five years at LL.  \nThat\'s Lower Lab.', 'It is very misleading to say Sandra Miller is the 5th year principal. She was a assistant principal in a different school for two years while the administration was sued by parents and teachers. Then she came to Lower Lab to start as a principal. No need to cover up if you truly believe in what you are talking about.', 'Just to clarify, records indicate that Sandra Miller became the interim acting principal of Lower Lab in July 2015, which means she is starting her fifth year as principal.', 'With all the change of staff and teacher, here are the pros and cons of current school:\n\nPros:\nK teachers are both new.

Some of beloved 4-5 grade teachers left. 4-5 graders still do well in state tests with extensive help from private tutors. But none of the kids end up going to top notch middle school.', ""Lol. Are you sure you're talking about the right school? I was a parent at LL for 13 years with three kids (my youngest just graduated). None of my kids ever used a tutor for state tests, nor do I know of any other parent who did (though I don't doubt there may be some). All of my kids went to a top middle school (East Side Middle School), as did most of their friends. And, frankly, Wagner's SP program (where a large chunk of the LL kids go) is a great school, too, even though many people (wrongly, IMHO) don't consider it as high a choice."", 'Good to hear that you never used tutor. Me either. But does that mean using tutor is uncommon in PS77? Really?\n\nGlad to know you consider ESMS as a top middle school, as long as you are happy.

Believe it or not.', 'The school is losing its best teachers in a crazy way since the current principal took over 3 years ago. The dream music teacher left. Two Spanish teachers were gone without replacement by now. I feel bad for those young kids without Spanish class for about a semester. The founding science teacher with several decades of experiences in this school announced departure. If you are ready to look for a different school in a couple of years, it is the school for you. Otherwise, look somewhere else.', ""The science teacher retired and turnover is normal. Please don't blame this on our principal without any basis in fact."", 'Our son will be graduating from Lower Lab in a couple of weeks and we wanted to take this opportunity to express our feelings about the school, its leadership, and its mandate to educate our children in both academics and life lessons. Our son has an IEP and arrived at Lower Lab beginning in 3rd grade after a difficult period in private school and a partial year at our zoned public school.  In the three years he has been there, he has struggled but is now leaving with friends, lesson skills, life skills, and the confidence to take on any challenges Middle School wishes to put in his path.  It is interesting for me to read some of the commentary about the Lower Lab Administration.  While not an active participant in school affairs, it is abundantly clear that the Administration - from Sandy Miller, Gina Perez, Gina Goodman to the individual home room teachers (Laura and Claudia in Grade 5) and specialist teachers (Josh and Mr. G) - has been nothing short of extraordinary.  After my children were born, I became interested in education and have developed strong convictions about the subject based on research, discussions and reflection.  For me, education is a combination of mastering the quantitative aspects of subjects (the fundamentals) with learning to appreciate the artistic qualities of life (lighting the fire that inspires a child to embark on one\'s individual journey of discovery).  There are no road maps to light that fire and it is unlikely that it will be the direction you would have chosen for your child.  One must let go and expose the child to a variety of subjects, to different cultures, to alternative ways to think about solving a problem - always watching closely, quietly encouraging, helping on those mid-course corrections.  At the end of the day, the child will follow his or her own path. It is essential that these early learning years be complemented by the teaching of values - the values that we encourage our children to follow.  Each morning after my mediation, I silently read my Affirmations; one of these is regarding my children - ""I must live the values that I want my children to embrace"".  There are no shortcuts here.  I have read several negative comments about the principal, Sandy Miller.   Each opinion is important and I respect people who disagree with me.  In my experience, any organization - whether it be a school, a business, a country, a family - is successful if there is strong and positive leadership at the top.  I believe that the success of Lower Lab has been a combination of 3 pillars - philosophy, personnel, and community.  Sandy Miller is at the top of the pyramid and while each brick is critical to the engineering success, she has been the architect - through her focus on learning to her adoption of the Lower Lab Values to her warm greetings to students every morning.  Our son has been the fortunate beneficiary of this extraordinary experience and we are forever thankful to each member of the Lower Lab team who worked so hard on behalf of our little one. In my dreams, each child would be given the opportunity to go to a school like Lower Lab.\nWith greatest appreciation and respect to each of the teachers, the administration, the specialists - for the education and values you have taught our child.', 'PS 77 is one of three gifted and talented programs in the city to reach their goals for enrolling a more diverse class of kindergarteners and first-graders.

That’s an insult and quite frankly I don’t understand how parents that send their children here can celebrate a school with such a lack of diversity in New York. Shame.', 'Pros: Good teacher. Helpful staff.\n\nCons: Poor administration. Only 44% teachers consider the principal effective for the role. Many teachers and families left in recent years.', 'I feel like I won the lottery with Lower Lab - it is the perfect elementary school for my daughter. The education is amazing, and the community is small and warm. While the curriculum is rigorous, relevant and motivating, social emotional values are respected equally. As the kids advance, they are empowered through programs like peer mediation, helping the younger kids to their classrooms, and the Lower Lab Values. Students are well prepared for State tests and middle school admissions, and have several stellar enrichments such as Latin, dance, technology, chess...  There are only two classes per grade so the kids all know each other. Most families also know each other and regularly interact with the teachers and administration at our publishing parties, celebrations, principal ""coffee talks"" and  PTA sponsored events. My daughter has had the most amazing teachers, all of whom have really understood her skills and challenges and helped her achieve all she can.  If I ever have concerns, both the teachers and the administration have been extremely responsive and caring.', 'Our two children are at Lower Lab -- one in the upper grades and one in the lower grades. From the very beginning, we have been nothing buy happy with our experience there. \n\n\nWe have had lots of different teachers -- the tried and true ""favorites"" and the brand-new fresh faces and have always been happy. While the state test scores speak for\nthemselves (our kids kick butt on these tests!), the teachers do NOT only teach for the test. The kids get an accelerated and varied education. They learn how\nto become creative writers, critical thinkers, enthusiastic readers, scientists and mathematicians. Each class has a TA, which is great. \n\n\nThe PTA is very active. They host events throughout the year (events in the main yard on weekends, movie nights, an auction, a Halloween party, a talent show and more). All of these events bring families together which is nice especially since our families are spread out over Manhattan. The PTA runs an afterschool program that is great too – offering chess, Mandarin, ice skating, football, basketball, robotics and more. \n\n\nLab has great enrichments to add to the regular curriculum. In addition to Physical Education, Art, Music (Orchestra for 4th and 5th Grades), Technology and more, the younger kids study chess, architecture and bridges. The upper grades study creative writing and debate. National Dance Institute works with two of our grades for a great performance each year.  Fourth Grade works with a group called Wingspan to put on an original play about their Social Studies curriculum. Starting in the Fall, Grades 1-5 will take Latin (it is currently only for Grades 3-5). \n\n\nThe administration is devoted to the students! That place is a well-oiled machine thanks to Gina Goodman, the parent coordinator.  She is the first person parents turn to with questions or concerns.  She has seen it ALL.  She is so encouraging to the kids in everything they do.  Mrs. Miller, the Principal, is finishing her 4th year at Lower Lab.  Her door is literally and figuratively always open. Families meet with her to discuss the middle school process, child-specific matters, etc.  She brought “Lower Lab Values” to the school a few years ago – every few weeks, she introduces a new “value” to the kids (respect, commitment, perseverance, etc.) and a new book that relates to the value.  The value is celebrated with a big all-school assembly! Mrs. Miller is always working towards what is best for the school and the students and you can tell she really loves them!  Ms. Perez, our Assistant Principal, is incredible!  As a former Lab teacher, she really knows the history of the school and knows exactly what Lab needs to do to stay on top. You can always find her meeting with the staff or speaking with parents – every school should be lucky enough to have this crew! \n\n\nWe truly feel blessed that our children are students at PS 77!', 'I happily graduated Lower Lab in 2016 with some of the most amazing teachers and peer by my side.\n\nMy time at lower lab was amazing and never dreadful as I made some of the friends I have kept and will continue to keep for life at this school. \n\nThe teachers (however, many have left because of the most recent principal) are one of a kind and amazing at their jobs.  The level of education I received from their teachings were above none other. To this day I still see many on the street and never forget to say hello. All of my classes were memorable and fun and I never dreaded waking up in the morning to go see my friends.\n\nBecause of the small size of the school, there was no bullying and every single student was extremely close with one another. It was possible for me to go up to any student and start a conversation that could last an hour based off of how close everyone was to each other. Lower Lab showed me what a community means.\n\nMy time at lower lab was not under the leadership of Ms.Miller until my last year there in 2016. From what I have heard, the school has changed a lot. I feel the ""vibe"" of the school has changed a bit, but I am glad Gina Goodman can help keep the Lower Lab I remember in tact. \n\nI knew going into Middle School I wanted a diverse school with a strong community leading me to choose Yorkville East.

Amazing music teacher/program. My son thinks his computer teacher is hilarious, and loves the class. They do coding, graphic arts, typing, charts, etc. He has ceramics, which he loves. The teachers understand him, and give good reports. He\'s a wiggly, talkative boy, and they don\'t try to change him or act like it\'s a disease, unlike our old elementary school. The Principal is hands-on and approachable. The staff has been very caring and helpful too. I highly recommend Baruch!', ""How many teachers say they would recommend this school to other families?  95%  That's much higher than the city average.  Because teachers know what other schools are like.  \nHow many students say they feel safe in the hallways, bathrooms and locker rooms?  83%  Again way above the city average.  This is a public middle school.  In New York City.  \n--  This school is injected with over $1 million in funding per year for their Manhattan Youth after school program. They have chess club, coding, fencing, yoga, webdesign, football, Student Government, Robotics, theater, band, orchestra, cooking, hydroponics and MORE!?  I WISH these were offered when I was in school.  \n--  Like any school, you need to immerse yourself in the community to get the benefits.  If your child leaves everyday at 2:40, they miss out on so much this community offers.\n-- Teachers are there as early as 1 hour before classes begin for extra help. Teachers give up their time at lunch and after school to help any and every student who needs to catch up OR wants to get ahead. \n-- As to the comments below, a school can not monitor the web activities of its students when they leave the building. Look back to the anonymous school survey results.  The kids love 104.  Many families send 3 or more siblings there.  They become part of a community.  They remain part of that community.   \n-- Try and book a tour - it's hard - they are booked up because the word is out there.  Baruch is an INSIDE SCHOOLS staff pick for a reason."", ""I went to Baruch for one year before being accepted to Hunter College High School. Overall, Baruch wasn't too bad. I made some of my best friends here, and met some of my favorite teachers. Even in the SP program, curriculum wasn't very rigourus and I got homework once a week if that. The majority of things you will do in this school will be test prep so be prepared. Being someone who opted out of the state tests, this was a bit annoying. Sometimes I would get bad grades in English because I didn't follow the proper state test format, and that was all we learneed every day."", ""I just got accepted into this school, and my friend said he got into some special program thing for the privlaged kids, while I got into academic. So I wondered: What's the differnce between academic and special?"", 'I attended Simon Baruch MS 104 from sixth grade to 8 months into seventh grade and got a transfer. I\'m shocked at all the positive comments to say the least. \nI\'m not the only student who feels this way but Simon Baruch MS 104 is absolutely one of the worst schools ever and will tarnish your child\'s middle school experience into pieces. I was sent to Simon Baruch as a zone school and let me say it\'s a zone school for a reason. There are two main issues with the school 1) the teachers and staff aren\'t attentive to students needs at all. If you\'re a student who needs any academic help or a student who suffers from special needs and you are in need of any type of guidance or extra help, you will not receive it from teachers and staff at Simon Baruch. I\'ve never witnessed more unhappy teachers and staff than at Simon Baruch. They don\'t send positive learning vibes AT ALL. In the classrooms the learning experience is traumatic and horrific and like 9/10 of the classes. They have houses and in each house the SP class is probably the only okay class, meanwhile the other classes students leave the room without permission to cut class and talk to friends. Students get sexually harassed and bullied severely in classrooms and teachers are no help at all and as I said before not attentive. The classes are out of control and most students disrespect teachers and interrupt their peers ""learning experience"" and nothing is done about it. 2) the bullying and drama between students is so horrendous. People are sexually harnessed daily and also severely bullied. Again no action is ever taken to stop this and keep the safety of students. The guidance counselor is not help and actually participates in the rumors and dramas that go on. Teachers are childish and careless and are in charge to take care of the students who are children. Fights go on every week. Students beat each other up all the time. On Baruch property during the day and after school.\nAll in all, I\'m glad I transferred wish I would\'ve transferred earlier because I didn\'t learn anything at Baruch and got really bad grades because of being constantly rejected by teachers and peers when asked for help. Baruch isn\'t a good middle school and I would 10000% urge parents to look for other schools to put their children in. The learning is horrible at Baruch, so are the teachers and the students harassment is unreal. I really wouldn\'t know what I\'d do if I were still there.\n  \n', 'A 14-year-old was arrested after police say he coerced girls into sending him nude pictures on Snapchat.

They have a 97% attendance rate. The students want to attend school! They have a multitude of after school activities, sports and clubs and each child can choose to participate. The only way to make this school better is to stop the parents from whining about its shortfalls What??? if a teacher is remote, then go make an appointment to see he/ her.  Why don\'t you try to volunteer and check out what actually happens in the building. Better yet, why don\'t you speak to a Baruch student.  What is the big deal?? Bullying? Yes, it happens - just tell your child to deal with it the best way possible (most of these kids resolve their issues w/o parent interference) or if it\'s egregious, report it to the teacher or vice-principals or directly to Principal Gaetani.  These kids are trying to push the boundaries because they\'re teenagers.  My daughter was threatened and victimized in May 2014 and guess what - she worked it out, even when I offered to help. She said she could handle it. She\'s unscathed and no trauma ensued. There is no magical method. Parents need to be involved.\n\nAnd do you think just because it\'s SP classes the students are sitting perfectly still in class w/o any distraction or behavioral issues??? These are KIDs and SP behavior is the same as Academic students\' behavior. You should be thankful the teachers are all professionals and know how to handle 30 kids and not go berserk. \n\nTo the parent who admits to be a former bully - did you bully 30 kids in the classroom at the same time? Did you form a gang of other bullies? Or were you just a rambunctious student who liked to fool around? Did you beat anyone up? Did you use bad language? Define your bullying. Because the deans haul in the student and parents to resolve these  quite expeditiously.\n\nAnd stop complaining about a Principal who oversees over 1000 children on a daily basis. An active parent can be part of PTA or can volunteer for any of the several events the school offers and needs parental guidance to manage activities.

02M111,"[""Just want to say that the Pre-K and G&T K have been excellent experiences at PS 111.\n\nIn Pre-K, my daughter learned a ton from a very experienced and knowledgeable teacher and teaching assistant, who were as warm and lovely as any ideal Pre-K teacher could be. My daughter had fun and loved going to school. Her classmates were a very diverse class--with friends whose parents ranged from professionals with a house outside of the city to friends whose families lived in hotels. But you'd never know. All the kids loved one another and their teachers. \n\nIn G&T K, especially during this Covid-time, the teacher has been amazing in keeping up the curriculum and being as engaging and patient with the kids on vidchat. She's found the right balance to not overwhelm the parents with helping the kids do schoolwork too. Before Covid, she was awesome in her classroom--very innovative and fun, and determined to help each of her students excel. \n\nMy daughter scored well on the G&T, and we explored 7 options: the 3 Manhattan citywides, LL (too far and seemed overcrowded and very similar to 111 in curriculum and facilities), PS 11 (smell of chlorine from the pool on the top level of the building, overcrowded computer classroom, imminent construction, and having to put her on a bus/commute on a subway to pick her up from aftercare and back home didn't make sense, the people at orientation seemed smug and cagey), PS 33 (parents seemed intense at orientation--the PTA volunteers got into a fight about who was supposed to be in a classroom during a specific time, seemed really segregated of all the schools, and overcrowded), and PS 111 (walkable to and from work, she knew all the specials teachers from being there for Pre-K, the specials had their own classrooms, it wasn't overcrowded, and the G&T wasn't overenrolled--she has a quite small class. I believe this has been the best advantage for still getting a quality education during Covid. She's friends with kids in her class and throughout the rest of K and her school, from knowing them from Pre-K and the excellent aftercare KING program. We also considered MTW/212, but it also seemed comparatively overcrowded. \n\nAnything deemed competitive (after the citywides) seemed unnecessary when there's a gem of a school right outside our door, almost literally. Principal Gilligan is engaged and fair. The PTA tries their best, and I feel like we were getting somewhere before Covid. The new parent coordinator seems very capable. The middle school hasn't bothered me or my daughter or her education. The facilities are spacious and are being updated or new. YOSL is free for all students starting in Pre-K and is an amazing music program. They have an excellent chess team.\n\nDon't discount this school in your search. The kids in the G&T, I was told, all got into their first or second choice middle school. PS 111 provides a wonderful foundation to get your kid where they might want to go someday."", 'Online classes for my child had little learning. All the teacher did was give a stack of worksheets and left the kids and the families to go through the work. Granted that nobody in school had virtual teaching experience, you would think the teachers would have guidance from school admin and have some synchronous learning combined with the worksheets. I hope they have a good plan for September.', ""I don't see much improvement in the way admin runs this school. I still hear that recess and lunch are a mess because of lack of staff or staff with proper training.

Visit the school and you will see for yourself.', ""The co-location appears to be working out in terms of separation of the middle school and elementary school.

The two schools will share all the common areas I heard. It's bad idea esp for the elementary school. Bullying is already a problem at 111 but is under reported. Imagine having older pre-teens with your young ones. PS 111 has good hardworking teachers and staff but this change will set the school back 10 years. All that hardwork for nothing."", 'All bullying is under-reported at all NYC public schools. It is an ongoing city-wide issue. Regarding the middle school (City Knoll) co-location, many newer parents are concerned (myself included) that middle school students may behave inappropriately towards the elementary school students. However, there is a plan to which DOE and principals of both schools have committed, where the two schools will carefully manage logistics so that the middle school have minimal overlapping periods with the elementary school. There will also be many graduates of PS 111 who choose City Knoll as their middle school, so I believe there will be positive school spirit for both schools. Time will tell.', ""The main strength of PS 111 is its excellent teachers and staff. The principal is not. For last several years, he has gutted the G&T program by combining in one class those children who passed the G&T exam with children who did not. In his own discretion and without telling any parent about his grand plan, principal placed non-G&T children in G&T classes. A non-G&T child is usually on level with his/her grade; a G&T child is usually a grade or two above his/her grade level. As a result, the principal's action has led to non-G&T children feeling inadequate or ill-prepared in class - which is not fair to those children who are just as gifted and talented in their own ways. Because of the varying levels of skills, the G&T classes move a lot slower through the materials. As a result, G&T at PS 111 is not really G&T class as envisioned, as promoted, or as expected by parents who send their kids to test for G&T. Principal should have consulted with parents before doing a social experiment with our children. Principal should also fully disclose this social experiment to prospective parents."", 'Regarding the criticism that Principal Ed Gilligan has “socially engineered” the G&T program by placing general education students who are not “qualified” into the G&T program, I could not disagree more. \n\nI am a parent of two G&T students including one currently in 5th grade. My children have thrived at this economically, racially and culturally diverse school. Our experience with the teachers and administration has been very positive, including the wonderful principal Mr Gilligan. \n\nMr. Gilligan has been proactive to improve the educational experience for all students. With support and funding from the PTA, he proposed and brought in a math trainer to improve the teaching effectiveness of all teachers in math. With input from the School Leadership Team (composed of parents elected by PTA, teachers and the principal), he introduced Mindful Meditation to help students focus and redirect their energy toward positive behavior and focusing on learning. He is always ready to meet parents in person to discuss concerns and try to address them.\n\nThrough his efforts, the school’s overall academic performance of all students has improved steadily since the start of his tenure. Another sign of his efforts starting to bear fruit is one third of the current 5th grade G&T has been invited by the highly selective city-wide G&T Anderson School (a K-8 school)  to take their 6th grade admissions test for 5-10 seats in September 2019. Only 500 applicants from across New York City schools who have high state test scores, report card grades, citizenship scores and strong attendance records are invited to take the test. We shall soon see how these students fared. However, it is a tribute to the school, teachers and Mr. Gilligan that such a new G&T program has such high performing students.\n\nOver the past two years, Mr. Gilligan placed several students from the 4th and 5th grade general education classes into the corresponding G&T classes. The centralized DOE G&T admissions program only has testing for entry into K-3rd grades. The principal has the discretion to admit G&T in the later grades if there is room in the class. The current 5th grade G&T is nowhere near the capacity of 32 students.\n\nHe told us at a recent PTA meeting the students he moved from Gen Ed to G&T scored well on their state tests and have very good academic and behavioral records. As two of these students are or were in my older child’s 4th and 5th grade classes, I can attest through my time volunteering in class, as a chaperone during school trips and afterschool play dates that these students belong in G&T.  They have shown maturity, ability to focus, learn and contribute to the lessons and to get along with other classmates.\n\nAs an educator and leader, it would have been very easy for Mr Gilligan to avoid criticism by making the least effort and maintaining the status quo. But instead he wanted to give opportunities for high performing students to get grouped with similarly academically paced and engaged students. \n\nUltimately, isn’t that the overall aim of education? To give each child the best chance for a quality education?', ""I haven't responded because I'm not sure this is the good spot to do this but Mr. Gilligan spoke at the PTA meeting in December (were you there?) and told us the citywide policy on placing students in G&T classes in 4th and 5th grade.  If a student comes from another G&T program in the city they can automatically be put in the G&T class.  He also said the schools can make a decision in 4th and 5th grade and they test any kid they think might be a good person for the G&T classes in 4th and 5th grade using reading and writing and math tests since there isn't a G&T test for those grades.  This doesn't seem like an experiment to me.  I agree with what anonymous said below about not all G&T students being able to keep up.  I am a parent for four years in the G&T class and I am very happy with the teachers' work and the guidance Mr. Gilligan is giving them."", ""This is very sad as I have seen it happen to the G&T classes in the 4th and 5th grade, when there is no more testing into the program. The G&T program that was created by the prior principal and the initial parents to the program will see the program be gutted into nonexistence as children from the regular program are inadequately prepared to take on the challenges and pace of G&T. G&T is there for a reason, to help children who perform above grade level thrive and be challenged. But if a child can't perform at above grade level, what is the point of the G&T program? Everyone will just end up being frurstrated.\n\nBut the one major concern is the principal. He does not inform families before a decision affecting an entire grade is made. Instead, the principal DOES like to social engineer the students without informing the families who are part of his experiments. If a child's confidence plummets because he or she can't keep up or the teacher is forced to slow down the pace to the detriment of everyone else, who is actually learning? In the end, the G&T program will fail."", ""My child graduated last year and her class was a 4th/5th grade combined. I understand D.S. and Parent's concern, however there were/are children who started the G&T program at PS 111 at kindergarten - 2nd grade that are now not able to keep up with the work in the higher grades.  Perhaps kids should be reassessed again in 3rd grade to properly identify who are G&T students."", ""As prospective parents are probably checking out this site to read up on what is going on at PS 111, I hope they all see the parent advocacy that is underway to preserve the school's character. The DOE's plan to co-locate a middle school is an insult to students from both schools because a proper analysis wasn't conducted on how all the children will be affected. PS 111 didn't use to be a school of choice for families. In fact, my eldest wasn't even supposed to come here. But, after visiting the school under the prior principal and seeing the vision she had in building a G&T program and truncating the middle school, so that PS 111 will be an elementary school, we decided to lose our private school deposit and enroll our eldest here. We are glad to send our two children here and the current principal, Mr. Gilligan, is doing his best with continuing the vision of a PS 111 elementary school. However, the DOE is all about cost-saving without looking at what is in the best interest in the children. They are trying to pass a co-location proposal--to put an entire middle school on the 4th floor of the school--which I think is unfair to the middle schoolers, without laying out an analysis or specifics in how our gym, cafeteria, bathrooms, hallways, and one main entrance and exit will be shared. Plus, the children who will end up losing the most are the students receiving IEP (special needs students receiving therapy), because guess where they are receiving therapy right now? THE 4th FLOOR! With this co-location plan, these IEP children, which the DOE proposal doesn't mention, will end up in windowless basement rooms. \n\nGiven that it is a new era and PS 111 parents will not lie down quietly while the co-location plan is being floated around by the DOE. a petition is circulating that I think all families looking at PS 111 must sign.

The latest is that the PTA Exec Board supports the petition to demand the DOE perform a proper analysis of the educational impact to students of both City Knoll and PS 111 in the same shared space.

I have been an active member of the PTA since my daughter started kindergarten in 2015.  I had many options for my daughter, including PS 212 and admission to several private schools.  I deliberately chose PS 111 after touring the school and meeting the parents and teachers on a school tour.  I was impressed by everything: the parents, the school and the vision the administration laid out for PS 111’s future.  \n\nI now have two daughters at PS 111 and have experience with both the gifted/talented and general education programs.  PS 111 has been a wonderful school for my children and both are thriving, showing capabilities well above grade level.  No school is perfect, but my children are safe, happy and academically challenged at PS 111.  The school community is incredibly welcoming and supportive to my children and my husband and I as parents.  My children’s teachers have been and are incredible in terms of their true dedication to learning and their partnership with my husband and I as parents.  This is no less true of the school administration, including Principal Gilligan, Principal Harvey, Zaida Cosme (the parent coordinator) and all of the other school aides and personnel.\n\nThe same holds true for the PTA.  I accepted the challenge of being PTA Co-President because I was truly inspired by all the hard work done by the PTA in just a few short years.  In four years this PTA has grown its membership, fund-raising efforts and support given to the school.  There have been a significant number of improvements made to the school that have been led and funded by the PTA, including air conditioning, a new sound system for the auditorium, a completely renovated teacher’s lounge and dance classes for the students, to name a few.  Due to the efforts of the PTA we have been able to fund a significant math training program for the school’s teachers this year.  This sizable effort will only benefit our children, who are already fulfilling the promise of the school with a nice increase in the math and ELA state scores for the school  (yeah! go students!).\n\nI understand that there are many parents who are upset at the idea of a colocation.  To the extent that the PTA can make sure that those parents have information about the proposed plan and give them a forum to express discontent we will certainly do so.  Currently, the PTA is not aware of any additional information about the proposal other than it is being discussed by the DOE.  While we all wish dearly that the DOE would provide us with more, they follow their own rules and regulations and are not governed by the wishes of the parents.  I understand that the lack of information from the DOE has been frustrating for every parent and I encourage parents to reach out to the District Superintendant and anyone else at the DOE to make their frustration known.\n\nBut I hope that we can refrain from turning our frustration on one another, whether it is the PTA or other parents who simply don’t agree with an opinion.  As an important reminder, every parent and guardian of PS 111 is a member of the PTA.  While there are 6 elected Board Members, we are *not* the PTA.  All the parents of PS 111 are.  However, it is true that as elected Board Members, we take on the lion’s share of the responsibility for keeping the organization up and running.  We do so because we believe in our school, children, parents and community.  There is no colocation which can change that.  As a PTA we are truly stronger together, but in doing so we must recognize and honor the diversity of our experiences, voices and opinions.  We must do this on easy issues and it is more important to do so on harder issues like colocation.  \n\nIt is truly unfortunate if parents decide that they will not support the children of PS 111 unless the PTA and all other parents agree with their opinion.  I, personally, will be working as hard as I can at all upcoming fundraising events for our school and children.  And when more information becomes available I will assess and make an informed decision about the merits of colocation.  I will attend every public hearing and make my opinion known.  I invite every parent at PS 111 to join me in this.\n\nOf course, I welcome your comments but please, let’s keep it civil.  There is so much that has happened today which is likely the result of public incivility (among other things to be sure).  I simply want to do the best I can for the school and its children.\n \nThank you for reading.  You deserve that glass of wine now :)', 'Thank you for all your hard work and dedication.  Very well said and I agree with every single word including the wine now :)', 'Colocation issue is consuming the school. The PTA I heard is staying out of the issue. It will not oppose or support the colocation plan. Why help the PTA at all if the PTA will not oppose the colocation plan? Why support the school if it does not care about parent\'s concerns about having their kids share facilities with middle school youths? Parents are starting to expressing their opposition by not participating in ""school building"" activities. I heard some parents are planning to leave next year. I afraid of the downward spiral of the school we loved when we came last fall. The teachers and staff we met are amazing people. I\'m afraid they too are not happy with the coming middle school, but they can\'t do anything.', 'Malik, I sympathize with you. I also find it upsetting that the PTA will not take a stance against the co-location given the fact that the co-location survey did not have a single response in favor of the co-location. The proposed co-location is purely based on cost & savings for the DOE. It is not based on the best interest for the students at either school.', ""I am one of the parents who don't want a middle school in our building.  But I realize that our PTA board can't take a side.  Other parents in my child's class are happy the middle school might come to our building.  My opinion isn't more important than their opinion and their's isn't more important than mine.  I don't understand how withholding support of PTA efforts like the carnival or bake sale is going to help the kids at PS111.  Like another poster said let's direct our anger at the system that allows this to happen."", ""Why help the “PTA” ? If you are a parent in this school you are a PTA member. Why help “yourself” are you asking ? Many dedicated PTA members who want to help “themselves” are investing their time and money to help the school where YOUR kid is spending the majority of his/her time.  THAT'S WHY. The co-location is a concerning issue that impacts many schools in the city and it has a much broader impact than just PS111.  Educate yourself parents and fight responsibly. We need to reach politicians to stop the DOE from cutting corners and cost which is clearly not for the benefit of those who pay taxes. Wake up parents and find a more productive way to address the citywide issue of co-location."", ""Sad to see a lack of leadership from the current principal on this co location plan. The former principal had the vision and conviction to lead the charge in removing the middle school years ago. Current principal seems to be more keen on keeping District 2 superintendent happy than promoting the welfare of PS 111 children. Why doesn't he lead like former principal Medina? Mr Gilligan, the same factors for removing the middle school are the SAME factors that should guide you in preventing the middle school from co locating at PS 111. How hard is that to figure out? Wake up and smell the coffee. We need you to lead."", ""Heard news that DOE is looking to co-locate City Knolls, a middle school at PS 111. Is this true? When do parents have a say in this? PS 111 used to have a middle school, which was phased out by the prior principal because of its troubled past and it wasn't creating a safe environment for the elementary school kids (if you read the comments from that time period, it is telling). So why would the DOE decide to put another middle school in there? It seems like the school as an elementary school is on the upturn and there is progress. But if City Knolls ends up in our school, all that progress and effort into phasing out the middle school was wasted. Elementary and middle school kids need separate schools, and it doesn't help in this situation that they will share the same entrance and facilities.\n\nSo if anyone has more news about co-locating a middle school or City Knolls, please share. I think new and current families deserve to know everything that is happening so we can have time to make an informed decision."", ""A few months back I posted a review which I still support. However, I do want to state that this school really is growing immensely and people listen. Every school will have its minor drama (who doesn't?)  but this school staff really cares about its students and they have great activities and resources for kids and families. I wish more families would take advantage of the parent workshops and programs. They all go out of their way to create programs that will be helpful to your family and the forum Konstella is really great to keep informed on what is happening with your child's class and school. The school is really growing in a positive way direction and if you just speak up and are your child's advocate then you will really become like family with staff and other families. It is important to get involved plus it helps you meet others who will become good friends."", 'Help! Would anybody please help me distinguish between PS 111 and PS 33 G&T programs?

Location-wise, both are equally convenient.', ""I'm not too sure about the G&T program but I know that there is lots of positive growth at PS 111. I would see if the parent coordinators at each school can help you connect with other parents in the programs. I know that Zaida at PS 111 is very organized and hands on in connecting parents."", ""PS 111 admin continue to fail in communicating with parents in the school. few weeks ago, Principal cancelled the presentations at the science fair without telling the children and the parents. my child was very eager to present his experiment, so were other kids. many parents took morning off from work to come to school to see their kids present. BUT on the day of science fair, principal told science teacher, who is god send to this school, that they can't present because there's not enough time and charter school on the 4th floor has to use the cafeteria. (this school has cancelled other events like middle school orientation on the day of events without telling parents). why tell us all of these on the day of the science fair? parents were upset but no explanation from the principal. this principal is too overwhelmed i feel with too many things and cannot delegate to others. he cannot do anything well because he is spread too thin. i think this school needs a more focused principal (because when he can focus, we've seen the good things he has implemented like the mindfulness program) and another assistant principal and parent coordinator to take the load off him. with better leadership and the already good set of teachers, this school will be a great choice for parents. before that happens, it'll be rough."", 'Two of our sons go there. There are many pros and cons. The cons are that there are a lot of fights  and bullying. The pro to that is that the counselors are REALLY hands on and the Principal tries to be and make a good effort. I think he is pretty new but I can see him succeeding at this position if he is will to take in more parent comments and suggestions to heart. I am a very hands on parent so thankfully I make my voice heard and this is important at this school. The location is great. Another con is that most (not all) teachers just go to do their job and that\'s all. My kids were being home schooled and they did amazing in a focused environment but when I had to put my kids in school for financial reasons, I told the parents what I needed from them to help my children succeed. That was not done and now my 4th grader is going to be held back cause ""he doesn\'t understand"" yet he was doing 5th grade curriculum from a Catholic School before. The PRO to this is that there are some great teachers like one of my son\'s 4th grade teachers that care but it\'s too much for only one teach er to handle. Another pro I will say is that I LOVE the counselors, the parent coordinator a couple PTA parents and the guards. Honestly, these people I speak of are awesome! The counselors actually CARE and are always accessible. This is VERY important. That leads me to another pro that teachers and all administrators are all very accessible which is important. If you are willing to make a voice for yourself then it\'s a good school but the bullying is an issue for out family so out son will be leaving.', ""The school is getting better. I feel it has a safe environment and don't hear any disciplinary issues. Parent involvement is still pathetic but it's an improvement from very pathetic. The school is only as good as its parent body so parents need to keep nudging the very busy principal to implement improvements. There are certain decisions that the principal often takes without consulting the parents, so he ends up backtracking on the decision. For example, without consulting parents, he simply eliminated cap and gown for 5th grade stepping up ceremony. He also eliminated the practice of having teachers at the school yard in the morning to greet the kids as they line up with their classmates -- which was a practice that parents find welcoming and comforting. No discussion was had - just a radical change without even prior notice. The principal is busy no doubt but parents need to  feel consulted and respected so there has to be a balance. Parents need to feel their voices are heard. PTA meetings are great but many of us can't go to PTA meetings because of work, and PTA meetings are driven by PTA officers mostly and not the general body parents. The principal has to show he's open to ideas and has to devote time to parents' concern. Bring back the town hall meetings, if possible, after work hours."", 'Our child is in Pre-K this year and we could not be happier with the school, it has been a great experience these past seven months. Our child has had a fabulous time, loves going to school each day and has learned so much already. The administration staff is responsive and very nice to work with, great communication. The principal has turned this school around over the past few years, he has a clear vision for the direction he wants the school to go and is articulate, smart, and always willing to meet with parents and the PTA. The PTA is awesome, I am so impressed with the passion and quality of involvement I see from the PTA. Granted, they need more parent involvement, but it is impressive what they have accomplished and I think it is only continuing to improve. They are a great group of parents who really care deeply about the school.  I have lived in the neighborhood 24 years now and didn’t think I would send my child to PS 111, it did not have the greatest record when I first moved here. The principal has made significant improvements and as the neighborhood has changed the school has also changed. I also really like the school building, with a large re-designed playground (open on the weekends) and a smaller yard for younger kids, plenty of space, windows, large classrooms, and really nice security guards at the entrances. This is my first online review of anything, not something I ever do but I am so impressed with PS 111: they deserve it.', ""AOES has changed in the sense that more families from the high-rises are sending their kids here. There is a higher percentage of parent participation, and greater communication with admin. The school however still appears under-staffed in both teachers and non-teachers positions. At lunch and recess, staff fails to supervise children. Some staffers (and not all) are often standing around talking with each other while K and younger kids are left to their devices. Staff needs to be trained (or told) to not be standing together and being dispersed throughout the yard to supervise the kids. There's also a big second grade G&T class (28 kids) with just one teacher. That's unheard of in this school and the principal thinks 111 is still lucky because other schools have over 30 per class. Well, that's nice but that's not why parents came to G&T at 111. The school is also pretty full because of the public charter school on the 4th floor. While there is harmony between the schools, the 111 kids have had to reduce gym time and yard time because it's now shared with the public charter. When it's winter and during inclement weather, this school will burst at the seams as everyone will be using the gym as the only place for recess. I hope admin has a good plan."", 'Can current parents comment on the G&T curriculum at PS 111?', ""The G&T curriculum is according to the State standards at a faster pace. HOWEVER, the curriculum is geared towards the child's individual talents and skills. Currently, the children are grouped according to levels and the ones who perform at a level higher for Math or Science than their grade level are invited to join the math or science class one grade above.\n\nThe teachers do their best to challenge the children and I cannot praise the Math and Science teachers enough as they do their best in engaging the children with the limited school resources."", ""As one of the first families who took the risk and enrolled their children in the G&T program at PS 111 when it first started, I can't brag about the program enough. The administration has been very engaging in getting parents involved. using the limited resources they have. The principal and admin have gone above and beyond in making sure our children are constantly challenged. Our concerns about materials or teaching techniques are always answered in an effective and timely manner. We seriously thought about homeschooling our children before choosing PS 111.\n\nWith small classes and individualized instruction, our children have been consistently challenged academically by the teachers. I would even go as far to say it is even better than private school. As a native NYer, I am a product of NYC public and private schools so I am in the unique position of experiencing both and can make a comparison. I don't know any other school or G&T program that has a Math teacher that provides 1x1 instruction for our child because they are in a higher math level than their peers. The school has been doing their best in bringing the best teachers into the school who not only challenge our children, but have empathy and the passion to teach. \n\nThis school is definitely a work in progress, but as the neighborhood becomes more gentrified, I am hoping that more parents send their children to this wonderful school and become involved in the PTA. Like other schools, we cannot improve without the efforts of all the parents. \n\nI encourage all families who are deciding whether to enroll their children here to walk into the school and ask for a tour. The door is always open. Only then can you see for yourself whether this school is for you.

Yes, unfortunately there is only one PC who was out for 4 days - so if you are anxious to find out info, contact the Principal. However, when school resumes the PC will be back. FYI, A good time to head to the main office is after 8:45am or before 2:30pm - those times are really busy. However, the office staff are accommodating when you enter the office - granted patience may be required.  \nJust my thoughts (2yrs there) about the school - Principal Gilligan values equity which is demonstrated in his words and actions, there is a very low turn over of school staff AND there are areas that need improvement. You seemed to have picked up the issue with communication and organization - which is being worked on, but change is not quick. As for Krispy Kreme - if you compare 111 there will always be pro's and con's and if you decide to come to 111 you can advocate for change by being part of the board of the PTA / attend the meetings as the KK fundraiser came from the PTA - and where $ would come from for a wellness chef. \nMy last thoughts are PS 111 is not for everyone - there is STILL change happening and given the vast diversity of students who attend PS 111 - this school needs parents who understand this, who support the changes and who will advocate for ALL of the children, not just their own b/c they have more disposable income or the time to be (or value) involvement. Good luck in making your choice. "", ""Thank you - it's nice to know there is an organized orientation in August. But, unfortunately, we must make our decision by June 16, communication by the staff or not notwithstanding. \nAlso, I understand your assertion that parents should be advocating for ALL children but that is impossible when there are so many interests, each individualized. Coming from a pre-school where there was heavy involvement from all parents, it was nice to be part of a community that supported each other and shared in responsibility. I hesitate to go to a school where that is inequitable. \nThe fact of the matter is, the majority of G&T students come from families that are somewhat aware or involved in the education of their children (hence, preparing, registering and taking the test in the first place) and these families tend to have, at least limited, disposable income. Not just at PS111, not just in NYC, but all over. The statistics on this are solid. These families also tend to ask more questions, expect more answers and have a heavier hand in the day-to-day education of their children. This is a good thing. It seems to me, though my interaction is limited, PS111 may not be prepared for this type of involvement though they say they welcome it."", 'Hi HK 33 - is that for PS 33? I attended that school as a child!! Anyhow, I TOTALLY agree with your comments about the majority of G&T students. That is a fact (and yes a good thing of course)! However, my point was not in contradiction to that fact. My comments are a reflection of my thoughts, values and beliefs about social justice, equity and privilege just as your comments are a reflection of your thoughts and values. My experiences at 111 and elsewhere have demonstrated to me there is not total equity when it comes to involvement in any group setting. You were fortunate to experience that if ALL of the parents did as you wrote, and unusual. I am hesitant to encourage you to join the 111 community if you think advocating for all students is ""impossible"" b/c that is what the current PTA board has done.

You might be right that PS111 is not for us. Each child is an individual and has specific and sometimes unique strengths and weaknesses. There is never a one size fits all solution, as you indicated. If one child is strong in debate and another in dance but one program has to be edited then I would expect the parents for each would advocate in their child\'s best interest, and should. I\'m sure as a parent of a child in the IEP, you would certainly support and fight for that program more than a parent who has no involvement, naturally. \nFor you to actually state that I (or anyone, for that matter) think it\'s in the best interest of the school to advocate for just the financially privileged, is widely off-base.

So my son’s school was only slotted for the third and last “tour” date.  I don’t understand why they didn’t allow flexibility for students and families to choose from 3 dates.\n\n2.

Interestingly though, in contrast to their diverse audience of black, Hispanic, Asian and white families, all the eighth graders were white.\n\nPerhaps their minority students couldn’t take part because they had to study for exams, had personal commitments or were just plain out sick that day. The optics, however, in light of ESMS’ longtime reputation, deserved or not, as a school of privileged rich white Upper East Side kids, were jarring. \n\nTo their credit, the principal talked about their sister school in Kenya with whom they have an annual video conference (yes once a year if I didn't misunderstand). He also said they will set aside 17% of their seats for low income students. \n\nHowever, he never touched on why all their student representatives were white.

We also hold an additional information session for parents of ICT students.  We do allow some flexibility and offer parents the option to contact us if the date assigned to their elementary school does not work for them. The open house dates are posted on our website and the DOE website at the beginning of the school year. For families that cannot attend an open house, we always participate in the District 2 Middle School Fair in October.  At this event, ESMS administration and  current and former student volunteers distribute information to prospective families and address their questions.\nWe do not give tours of the building.  We have over 2,000 parents and children each year that are interested in visiting our school and find tours of empty classrooms to be unproductive. We feel it is a far better use of everyone\'s time to have the faculty and students talk about our school philosophy and culture and to answer questions.\n\n2. We are pleased that you found our student speakers “inspirational” (we do too)! We ideally would like to have a diverse group of speakers as well, however, as you said yourself, students have after school commitments and cannot always return to school in the evening. We have many students volunteering for the Open Houses and we try to give all our volunteers a chance to participate.

There are some students who might be called self-entitled, but that's a minority and it's discouraged by the administration.

My first grader loves the specialties - music and performing arts especially - and can't wait to learn to read music next year in second grade.  He's also become a chess player because of 116.

There is a wonderful group called Parents for the Arts who feel as passionately as I do and are committed to making sure our children are exposed to an engaging and dynamic art curriculum. Personally, one of the reasons I wanted to be in 116 over the River School was because of their decision to adopt PDF (Playtime, Downtime, Family Time) in lieu of homework.  My first grader reads every night (I can't get him to stop), fills out his reading log and makes smart choices for his PDF.  He is reading above grade level and enjoys doing math activities at night (by choice).  The school has woven SEL/mindfulness (the importance of breathing, meditation, etc) into all their classes.  The principal hosted a PD last week for thirty other AP's to teach how to do it successfully.

02M130,"[""I am extremely pleased with the creativity of the TAG program. As a parent, I do not feel comfortable with rote assignments that reflect volume only. In my opinion, rigor is not defined by volume but by quality instruction which is reflective of MULTIPLE intelligences in the classroom.  The STEM projects, inspired critical thinking by way of Socratic methodology and progressive teaching strategies are the very definition of quality learning. Our children are as close to receiving a private school education in a public school as it gets. I always feel seen and heard by not only the teacher, but by administration. I'm truly disheartened that some parents, rather than voice their concerns face to face, are taking to a public forum to soil the outstanding reputation of our beloved school and its teachers. I feel extremely lucky that my child gets to attend this wonderful school. Private school is always an option for the dissatisfied. If you are a parent  looking for a public school that promotes creative arts, multiple intelligences, social emotional learning, and rigorous instruction- PS 130 is for you!"", 'I was all with you until the part of private school education in a public school.  I am not sure if it was your intend to belittle the public school system but both the private and public system have their pros and cons.  I think the other parents are just voicing their opinion just like you.  And if you read their comments, some of them did tried to bring up their concerns with the administration but was ignored.  I personally think PS 130 is a great school but it might not be the right school for those parents and kids.', 'Let me start by saying that my child is also in this 4th grade TAG class.  Some background info: There are two 4th Grade TAG classes.  Last year, a majority of our class\'s parents inquired with administration about the child-to-class assignment process.  We did so after finding out that parents from the other class lobbied to the principal to be assigned the more experienced teacher. \n\nWe sent in a long letter with a majority of the class parents signatures to get a response of ""See you in September"" from the principal himself.  We requested for another meeting to get the response of ""I do not think there is anything more to talk about"".  Administration also promised that they would make sure that the two TAG classes run on the same pace. \n\nThe two classes are completely off pace from each other.  The workload and output of the other TAG class is what we expect from a blue ribbon school.  The workload and output of our TAG class is what they were able to produce in their 3rd grade TAG class.  Not only this, we have 32 kids in our class while the other class has 28.  \n\nDont get me wrong, I do not at all blame the teacher.  Administration is 100% at fault for not providing a solution to this inevitable problem.  This problem was identified a year ago, and nothing was done to prevent it.  It is simply disappointing that parents concerns are pushed aside and not addressed.', ""I am actually very impressed that the 4th grade teacher you refer to saw a teaching moment to attend the beautiful movie called Wonder. My child is getting a well-rounded education in that class, because they are prepared academically as well as working on STEM projects. That's not entertainment! I'm happy that they have a good amount of homework, but not overloaded with repetitive math problems. I love that the parents are involved in their classroom celebrations. The teacher responds immediately to any email I send, so if you have concerns it should be YOU as the parent to reach out. It actually sounds like you are the irresponsible one, not the teacher. That's so sad that your child has been so unhappy since September, but you kept them in the class. Shame on you."", 'Just curious - if you are concerned that this teacher’s effort and work’s lackluster as well as being very irresponsible, then why is your child still in this class? I would have taken my concerns directly to the teacher and voiced my concerns directly to administration immediately. Why wait until the end of February to air these concerns? You have every right to take your child out of the school if you are so dissatisfied with the quality of his/her education.', 'PS 130 used to be an outstanding school, but with my child this year the teacher is very irresponsible. Her effort and work’s lackluster and she misinforms the class students. My child current 4th grade teacher didn’t teach the students much and is too fond of entertainment. She rarely emails us in regards to academic or learning, but for the holidays she emailed us over and over for what food, drinks, and snacks to bring in to school. She brought the class into a trip to a movie theater and this trip was meant for 5th graders. Afterwards, there was NO writing assignment. In addition, her class is supposed to be on par with other class and we have been notified by admin that the teachers will work together to provide equal levels of education. This’s NOT the case. Our class trails far behind other class and has substandard education compared to other class. Her homework is in extremely small amounts. Homework from 2nd and 3rd grade is more plentiful than the amount she gives. Has the DOE curriculum changed? The other class has plentiful amounts of writing to prepare the classes for the upcoming ELA and Math classes. They have a writing assignment almost daily. A bit of fun and joy is acceptable, but my child class is overloaded with entertainment. The teacher does rarely gives feedback and the homework feedback is rushed. She spends too much time going to movies and partying than doing the job she is paid to do. She is irresponsible and unsuited for the job. She told the class that spelling isn’t important in ELA which is completely incorrect as poor spelling can drag your writing score down.

We were lucky to get a G&T 1st grade spot at PS 130 with a youthful but absolutely spectacular and experienced teacher named Ms. Jessica Chan who actually graduated from PS 130 and was trained by the legendary Mrs. Woo. Our child went from being bored and restless to flourishing under Ms. Chan. There was some adjustment from our child's Kindergarten being 100% like Playgarden (downtown toddler and preschool activities place) to the intensity of Singapore Math and daily homework that was actually academic in nature. But we loved it and loved the teacher (Ms. Chan) who deftly had the right balance appropriate for high achieving first graders to learn at an accelerated pace, and warmly treating a kid like a kid. We still save Ms. Chan's famous, well organized Blue Book, as an artifact we want our child to look back on 10 and 20 years later for the teacher who made a seminal impact.  PS 130 frankly was not originally on our radar because of its location but we believe it is a hidden gem that is hugely under-marketed.  It is an outstanding school for parents who believe in academic achievement, and the enhancement programs are actually quite rich. We were so turned off by the Kindergarten experience in the other downtown public school, we were going to send our child to Packer in Brooklyn Heights for first grade, and thinking longer term about moving to the suburbs in high performing school districts.

We decided on the Pre-K at PS 130 because we liked the young administration of PS 130, led by a caring, warm principal named Mr. Fong, and two youngish Assistant Principals who ""showed well"" as competent educators and administrators. The pre-K at PS130 was transformative for our son. He was always a shy reserved child, but the rich arts program at PS 130 transformed our son to be out of his bubble, where he now loves to sing, dance, recite ""rhyming songs {rap} "", and crack jokes. We are very grateful to an extraordinary duo of teachers are son had, a very experienced, talented devoted one named Ms. Lai and her assistant, a new young teacher named Ms. Baker.

Most of the time new teachers walk in and leaving the school same time as the students.The school is a safe and friendly environment for kids, but there are deeper problems being hidden by that facade.  Still some bright spots,such as some of the music and art teachers and the security are excellence. This NOT the school it used to be.', 'agreed', 'I have to respectfully disagree with the comments above about the current administration and inexperienced teachers.  \nOur two children have been attending PS130 for a few years now and our experience has been wonderful.  With any new administration, there are bound to be changes but we have not seen any negative changes at all following Mrs. Woo’s (former principal) retirement.  Mr. Fong (current principal), Ms. Pearsall (AP) and Ms. Thomas (AP) always have the best interests of the children at heart and they have done an excellent job maintaining the quality and standards of the school.  The school continues to be a high performing school with an excellent academic program and wonderful enrichment activities.  \n\nWe believe the school has done a very thoughtful job at “succession planning” so there is not a “shock” to the system with the retirement/departure of any leader or teachers.  Take the transition of administration as an example, before Mrs. Woo retired, she had worked very closely with Mr. Fong (who was then an assistant principal and had been a teacher at the school for years) and Ms. Pearsall (who had been a teacher at the school for years as well) to ensure the “next generation” leaders could capably handle the new responsibilities when the time came for her to retire.  Even after she has retired, she still makes herself available to the new administration for any advice they need.  Ms. Chin (former AP) did the same thing.  The transition to the current administration could not have been more seamless! The same applies to the training and development of the teachers.  This is a school that is built to last and it is very impressive to see the administration and teachers all committed to sustaining excellence for generations to come.\n\nIn response to the specific comment about the teachers, it’s true that some experienced teachers have retired in recent years so there are newer teachers at the school, but the vast majority of the teachers are very experienced and have been with the school for years (some for decades!).  Note that these are retirement of older teachers and they did not leave the school for any other reasons - this is a very natural cycle of any organization – you cannot expect the “older generation” to stick around forever!  In the past few years, our children have had a good mix of highly experienced teachers (with one having taught at the school for almost 30 years!) and newer teachers and all of them have been excellent.  We think the administration has done a great job attracting teachers who believe in the school’s philosophy and culture of excellence and the teachers we have seen thus far are very committed and dedicated. There is also a very high level of collaboration among the teachers and they regularly exchange ideas and “best practices” among themselves.  From what we have observed, the more experienced teachers are very active in training and developing the newer teachers to ensure they maintain the same quality and standards of teaching across the school.  \n\nThe level of commitment and dedication of the administration and the teachers to the school and the children are really quite amazing.', ""You can disagree with me. But I'm sure a lot of parent agreed with me. I also have to respectfully disagree with you the teachers leaving PS130 are NOT OLD and they are NOT OLDER GENERATION.

The Funds go back to our children.', ""I think a part of the issue is that a new parent does not yet see everything that goes into the school.  To a new parent in the school, it might seem aggressive.  However, this PTA works above and beyond to support the school.  Many other District 2 schools have rich parents.  PS 130 does not, but they do not let the students suffer because of it.  Other schools ask for hundreds of dollars to raise money so they don't have to work on fundraising daily.  Our PTA works hard every single day to raise money, so they do not have to ask low income families for $500 or more that they might not have.  I have never seen a more hard-working PTA.  Every dime goes to the school and the kids.  The PTA raises money for new tech, dance, art, renovations, academic programs for the teachers and anything else that will help the school progress.  Even if they do ask me for a dollar here or there, I will comply because I see where it goes.\n\nThe PTA runs almost every event and fundraiser, so the teachers can focus on class.  Book fairs, picture day, parties, food drives, etc. - they are even involved in the day to day routine - keeping the drop offs and pick-ups orderly.

The classrooms themselves are good-sized and the curriculum emphasizes project-based learning and creativity, which we appreciate. \n\nAs for facilities, the younger grades eat lunch in the classrooms and older grades go to the multipurpose room (it doubles as the music room). The plaza serves as the recess yard, which has functioned pretty well for years until the current principal decided it was problematic. Previously, the recesses were as fine and normal and active as other schools, no incidents.

The small front office takes every inquiry or interaction as an affront (like, how dare parents ask questions or raise concerns!). The principal (Jenny Bonnet) is an awful communicator and for unknown reasons, takes complaints as personal critiques. Often the response from the front office is ""we\'re on it"" (code for ""shut up, go away"") but there\'s little confidence in their decision-making process.

There is hardly any punishment for the bad kids who repeatedly get in trouble.', 'My son is in seventh grade at Wagner SP and he has had a great experience at Wagner.  The academics are strong but the homework is manageable.  He has never been a victim of bullying.  In fact, he has made a lot of friends beyond those whom he was friends with from elementary school.  He also enjoys the overnight trips they sponsor each year.  In June, he will be going to Philadelphia, and he is excited to go to the Liberty Bell, Congress Hall, a science museum, an aquarium, and a yacht cruise. All in all, I have been happy with Wagner and it’s very welcoming, friendly warm atmosphere, which is a result of an amazing Principal and a wonderful parent coordinator and terrific teachers!', 'I can’t believe how well this school is run. Yes, it isn’t large - but it has an amazing principal - Vice Principals for every grade that are fantastic and a dean that will not stand for any misconduct. So, if there is an issue - he makes sure it is taken care of swiftly and fairly.   Not to mention a Parent Coordinator who keeps everyone informed and is happy to answer your emails if you have any questions. \nThe academics are fantastic. The teachers have rubrics and explain the expectations clearly. Your children won’t just memorize - but they will become critical thinkers. An example is in science class they watch an experiment & then must refute a claim and make a new claim based on the evidence. In English class they work on rewrites so they learn how to hone their writing skills. These are just a few examples. Wagner also has a lot to offer.  They also have a great band and theater program, lots of sports and fun after school clubs.', 'My son is an 8th grader in Wagner middle school. I d like to say that Wagner is a great school. It exceeded my expectations. We got everything what you can ask for from a school. They have an amazing sports programs (tennis team, track team, soccer team....) and a band (the students can learn how to play an instrument and play in a band).   The teachers and the staff are very professional and helpful. He got offer from three best high schools in NYC only with the education that he got from Wagner. (No tutoring or SHSAT courses). He always feels safe in school and around school. We totally recommend Wagner to everyone who is ready to learn and succeed. At the end of the day the success depends mainly on the students.', 'My child goes to this school and I do not know how they do it.  It is such a big school but my experience is that it is run very well.  I feel it is safe and my child gets a lot of support.  ALL of the teachers I have met over the last 2 years have been supporting and caring.  My child is not the best student but they give a lot of help.  The after school program is varied and plentiful.  My child was bullied in grammar school and that has not been an issue.  Every thing that has come up has been addressed satisfactorily with respect for all.  The school is very clean, the teachers and resource folk are caring and the administration, safety security are professional.  I could not ask for more.  We lucked out by having this as our district school.  Hopefully they will never lose the current parent coordinator!  The PTA is incredible and very active.Will be sad when my child has to leave this positive environment that has helped them grow.', 'Huge student body so a few troublemakers ruin it for all. The current bathroom policy is ""it has to be an emergency"" and you must sign out of classroom, sign into bathroom, go in one at a time, hurry, sign out of bathroom, sign into classroom. Need to use bathroom towards end of the day? Too bad. It\'s ""can it wait?"". If you don\'t believe me, call the school and ask if this is true.', 'Was excited for my child to begin at a school that gets well rounded praise from neighborhood parents. The band program is an amazing opportunity to have access to real music instruction, scarce in the public school system. However, our experience of Wagner is the emperor has no clothes. The administration is logistically efficient in corralling the hundreds of students that make their way through the doors but it often feels like little more than worksheet laden childcare. Red flags came up for me when my incoming 6th grader who I suspected to have dyslexia was earning honors grades in multiple subjects where the homework was either handed in incorrectly or not at all. They were very responsive to my emails but the conclusion was they have no time to check each individual child\'s homework. The actual academic expectations seem to be rote memorization and attendance. Zero critical thinking, no real student/teacher or home/school relationships. Feels very racially homogenous despite statistics listed on this site. PT Conferences are kind of misnomer, students stand outside of classrooms with clipboards, you can sign up for a 3 minute slot with each subject teacher and they will speak to you if there\'s time. Trips are infrequent but lackluster, ""in-school trip"" to watch a movie in the classroom and the Big Apple Circus.', ""One ginormous middle school on the UES with well over 1,000 kids for just 3 grades largely separated into 3 different academic groups. \xa0Academically YMMV depending on whether your kid is in AP, SP, or SP Honors, but administratively and culturally (day to day in the hallways) it ranges from impersonal to prison-like. \xa0Just too big for its own good, but District 2 and the principal are probably at a loss as to how to break it apart and make it smaller without turning the unscreened AP group into an at risk school with ~2 average state scores. \xa0So SP and SP Honors pull up the entire school's rankings, ratings, and scores while AP brings down its discipline and environment, all the while there's very little academic or social interaction between the 3 group is \xa0On paper this would seem to be a very diverse school, but unsurprisingly for NYC the 3 groups break down largely along ethnic lines so that Wagner's reality of diversity leaves a lot to be desired (though certainly far better than ESMS' white-bread preppiness). \xa0For example, SP Honors is great but the most segregated of all (well over 50% Asian-American while my child was there, and most of them stereotypically high-pressured kids). \xa0The band program is great too, maybe the best thing about Wagner, but only 1 out of 3 luck into it, and any kids with disciplinary problems are of course bounced out of it. \xa0My child was never bullied but 1) saw many instances over the years (by and of both boys and girls), 2) saw that the teachers were very inconsistent in doing anything about it, and 3) after a time gave up on saying something so as not to inadvertently get caught up in the administration’s disciplinary actions. \xa0As for the administration, they largely talk the talk but do not walk the walk... mostly platitudes and very little straight talk... until 3 years in when graduation approaches they confide how the only way they keep the school together and not descend into utter chaos is to create and stick to hard and fast rules (shocker). \xa0The whole experience was very frustrating for us and our child. \xa0While Wagner has come a long way from the metal detectors of its past, it's pretty much gone as far as it can go at its current outsized population."", 'My daughter attended Wagner a few years ago 2011 to 2014 and I was very disappointed. We actually moved to the neighborhood so we could attend thinking it was ""THE UES"" middle school.  In my opinion the main problem is that 55% or more of the students are bused in mainly from the Bronx.  From day one I was shocked at the culture this creates. Gang like mentality awaited us every morning as we enter the block of the school. Vulgar language abounds and gang like fighting was a regular occurrence usually after school on the sidewalk areas many involved girls.  I have always regretted leaving her at this school. Needless to say my son will not be going there. ', 'Are you implying that only BRONX kids are rowdy? I work at the school and the white upper east side kids are no better. Take your racist and classist comments elsewhere. Maybe do more research on a school before sending your child there, hopefully they grow up to be more tolorent and less racist than you.

It is everything a NYC school should be - rigorous, caring and diverse. I say this as a parent and as someone who has spent the past 25 years teaching and writing about educational issues. The major strengths of Wagner are its administration team and arts programs. All the admin staff are responsive and amazing educators. The music, visual arts and drama programs are also great. This school is a pipeline to Laguardia.  My other daughter is currently at Eastside, which is another great school, but I sometimes regret that she is not having the Wagner experience. It has a more responsive admin team, better arts and similar curriculum with far more diversity. Wagner gets 5 stars for being a school willing to give a great education to kids in the UES and East Harlem, the LES and other neighborhoods across the city!

By 8th grade most kids are in SP. ', 'I think Wagner is a wonderful place with a caring, thoughtful and deeply involved principal.  My son has made lots of friends at school, has had no issues with bullying  and loves the sports programs. Most important, he has terrific teachers who are helpful, motivated, supportive and responsive. They have high expectations, but always take the time to explain something in more depth when students need them to.  When my son talks about what he has learned in science, history, etc., I am amazed by the amount that has been covered and the depth of his understanding.  My son took a prep course for the SHSAT, which focused on math, which he said was a waste of time and money  because he had already learned all of the math from his math honors teachers. He was accepted by both of his first choice high schools-a specialized and a highly sought after non-specialized.', ""The honors program is a misnomer. I've learned nothing there that I couldn't have learned on my own at a faster pace and in more depth. I currently attend Bronx Science and it is no thanks to the teachers at this school. The teachers and students are racist and antisemetic and bullying does occur if you seem easy to pick on but nothing is done about it.

I can assure you that has little to do with Wagner education. Every child accepted to LGA had private coaches, same true for kids who got into other good schools. Upper East side is full of caring parents with resources needed to help their kids.\nI never met a single ""racist"" in three years at Wagner simply for the reason that people who are not comfortable find other schools and do not consider Wagner on the first place. I was shocked to find out how many kids come to Wagner every day from Queens, Staten island, midtown west, and every area of the city except for our zone.\nWe choose Wagner because the school is a block away from home and our son was a really good student - we figured he would do well in any school but cutting on the travel time would leave extra hours for sports outside of Wagner.\nWagner administration runs the school like a prison - kids allowed to use the bathroom during the school day three times a week, kids are being kicked out of the block the very same second they leave school, several field trips took place on days with the heaviest rain/storm,  \nLuckily our family interaction with the school administration was very minimal. On the good side, our class had a very good assistant principal (Ms. Dowd) and very good guidance counselor (ms. Mueller).\nOur son made lots of friends, (white, black, purple, yellow - you name it) and very much enjoyed the Wagner diversity. I would not recommend the school unless you live a block away and your kid is very self driven with tons of extracurricular activities.', 'I\'m going to respond on behalf of the Wagner SP program (I have no knowledge on  the general AP program here). My son graduated from a top elementary UES school. It wasn\'t until he attended Wagner that he truly came into his own..independence-wise and academic-wise. He really became dedicated to school-work and doing well at Wagner.\n\nthe above review is full of contradictions and pretty ignorant! and couldn\'t be more wrong in certain aspects. My son got into Laguardia because of Ms. Dyer (big salute to her). He had not an ounce of music experience prior to attending Wagner. Wagner is and has always been known as a Feeder school for Laguardia. So, he probably had a hidden talent (I assume) along with the amazing music program here. He also got into Eleanor Roosevelt, as most of his friends also had.. Absolutely no tutoring or private coaches involved on our part!    And many of his friends also took the SHSATs with no tutoring and still got into top schools like Science...what an assumption to say that ""every student "" you knew needed coaching because Wagner did a poor job of prepping?   students go the extra mile for tutoring for those tests because simply put, there\'s not a single school that can cover every item on the SHSATS, regardless of how good a school it is!.  And ""the UES is full of caring parents with resources...""  Newsflash, where do you think these kids at specialized schools are coming from??? All the city boroughs, many from poor neighborhoods. Many who can\'t afford Prep courses, many who don\'t have those resources. These students have something called a natural ability and talent, along with drive! Throw Wagner into the mix (since we\'re on the subject), and that makes for a pretty good chance of getting into any desired school.\nI know from experience ...that a huge amount of Wagner graduates went on to all the top public and Specialized High Schools around. \n\n I don\'t get the issue: your son seems to have had a great run at Wagner, made friends, got into a good High School, had a short walk to school, was able to do sports, etc  And you don\'t credit the school he\'s graduating from in the least? it take both a driven child and a good education to accomplish that... And yet you\'re unhappy with Wagner?\n\nrun like a prison? yes , some strict rules but they are needed. Bathroom visits should be limited ...imagine the zoo-scene with 1,400 students roaming the halls.\n\n not every teacher is great. But take the top schools around and you\'ll see there are good and bad everywhere. Honors classes are challenging, and regular are on par. \n\nWagner has something for everyone. Music program is among the top (and prob the highest funded) of city public schools, and there\'s an abundance of extra curricular activities.\nand Yes, there are kids taking the trains from all over (just like any kid from the UES would need to,  in order to attend other schools of choice), but MANY are from our neighborhood as well...as a matter of fact, from the local elementary schools...And not everybody wanted to go to Eastside Middle even when they know they stood a good chance of getting accepted. \n\n Wagner may seem like a sink or swim school at first but I think it\'s a great school even for the shy, easily-intimidated types. It teaches them to fend for themselves, to become more independent. Sets them up for the real world we live in , a bit more.\n I\'ve witnessed a lot of the typical UES snobbery that comes with ""no --WAGNER isn\'t for us"".. You\'d be surprised how quickly even the most intimidated child can adjust.. much quicker than their parents.', ""My son is graduating from Wagner & going to Beacon. 56 kids got into Elro and 10 to Beacon not to mention over 30 to LaG and I think  20 to Millium &   it seems the entire school to Lab.

I've never experienced this myself, so I don't know for sure, but this is what happened to a friend of mine a while ago.

VERY SMALL. 6-8 only have the top two floors of the school and the hallways could barley fit 2 people especially during transitions people often end up getting pushed around or yelled at for blocking the hallway, but other than that the teaches(most of the teaches) are very kind and supportive. As for the kids  i personally have had too much drama in this school and scince its so small everyone knows who your dating who, your fighting with, who's talking about who and yes this can be good in some ways but i always feel like i don't have many friends that i can trust not to spread our private conversations to the whole school. Overall, as long as you pick the right friends and don't get peer pressured into anything you don't want to do you will do great at this school the homework load isn't much at all the teachers give about a week to study before every test, the athletic programs are very popular but not really that good at all i play soccer ( outside of school ) and the teachers always tell me to join but i never do because there is no competition at all at this school, the girls soccer was so bad last season that this season there wasn't even enough players who wanted to play for the team so they had to get rid of girls soccer, boys soccer isn't the best either from what ive heard, i would say if you play volleyball or basketball then you would be happy at this school"", 'I’m in high school right now and it’s funny how he said he need the Homework for high school when it’s not true and I’m in pe class and all we do is play games so that is false', 'A diverse population of dedicated and kind students.

I’ve seen fights, profanity, bullying, and much more. The kids hate the school and are all exhausted and depressed. I suggest you don’t send your child here if they can’t stick up for themselves. Not to mention, the elementary school kids get priority. They get the big gym, big cafeteria, and basically the whole building. Yorkville only gets 1 1/4 floors out of the five. The hallways are awful. It is a whole stampede of kids in a thin strip hallway. Some of teachers are just lecturing us and not teaching. Some teachers expect us to know something about a certain topic and never teaches us it. I’m praying the year goes by fast so I can get out of this school.

What is the reason for him to behave in this manner?’ Because my child does not behave in this manner in no shape or form at home at all,” she said.\n\nScipio, along with the family’s lawyer and Herbert, is demanding the school answer for its actions.\n\n“For them to treat my child in this manner, I am flabbergasted,” she said.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday night, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education promised a swift response.\n\n“We are investigating this alarming allegation and taking swift action.

Other teachers our kid has had over the years have been also excellent. Lots of respect for the work they do and for how hard they try.\n\nThe PTA tries really hard also.

The only thing she consistently mentions is that her daughter went to Princeton and that it is typically irrelevant.  \nLast year the school had an extremely effective assistant principal who seemed to be the one keeping things on track, but he left the city last summer.

This school needs a great leader one of which she is not.', '""... She openly dislikes G&T families whose sheer existence clashes with her socialist world view."" \n\n\nConsidering that she used to be the assistant principal of P.S. 77 for many years this seems to be a bit unbelievable. It is true, though, that she doesn\'t bend over for parents and many G&T parents kind of require/expect that from a principal (again, from my own many years of experience with P.S. 77).', 'Children who do well on the kindergarten G&T test are usually children of families who can afford tutoring, study guides and books to help their children test well.

As a result, we have G&T programs in which Black and Latino children are underrepresented. ', ""I went to this school as a student years back. I was bullied quite often because I was a certain race. The staff at this school are also pretty bad. I was told that the administration would keep something to themselves. But what ended up happening was that all the teachers knew about the thing the staff promised to not tell anyone about. So one day in class I was helping a student with their work and showing them how to do it as the teacher was going over the work. I was called out and the whole class was told of the thing that wasn't supposed to be told to anyone and not known to anyone but the admins. So anyways I was questioned by many students and told them the teacher probably messed up names or something. I never took action to what happened that day. Also that teacher I'm told of from my younger friends that attend the school is still in the school as a teacher. I'm very disappointed that the staff didn't keep their promise to my parents and me. I'm also disappointed that the teacher would just blurt out something personal to all the students. I think that one of the teachers that were told of this thing was better about it and just talked to me about it. But the other teacher was outrageous and just blurted it out to everyone. Also that teacher that told everyone wasn't the official teacher of that room and wasn't the sub either. But I see that the principal who knew about the thing isn't the principal anymore. I hope the new staff and admin is better and is more efficient in keeping promises.\n\nAlso the official teacher used to make mistakes in math. I would wait until after she was done teaching so that I could tell her personally. The lesson I remember was the area of odd shapes. The teacher stated that you can imagine pushing the lines out then find the area of that. Then she told the class the final result was the answer. And surprisingly my peers actually believed her. At the end I went up to her and showed her she was wrong. She hesitated at first. Then I proved her wrong by solving it in a different way. Then telling her the way she did it was missing a couple of steps. \n\nI'm a student that attended Ps.198 from K to 5th grade and those years were tough for me not because of the admins or the teachers. The students were often bullied too. But I hope that's not happening anymore. I hope this school has improved from when I attended this school. I went to Wagner Middle School after Ps.198 and now I'm going to a specialized high school. I won't guarantee that someone would experience the same results that I got from going to Ps.198. In Wagner I attended honors science and honors math, I'm talking the regents in june."", 'Amen!

Well, my brothers and sisters had the same teachers and I 'd see them in front of the school now and again as an adolescent. I can remember teacher strikes, and hearing a lot about civil rights -- yes ! back then.  I went back to visit the school around 2000 and it was a mindblower.

02M212,"['The best thing about this school is their K-1 theatre loop. Starting in 2nd grade it goes downhill. The principal was a teacher at the school for over 20 years and was promoted to principal 3 or 4 years ago. Therefore, she’s basically managing her colleagues. The parents have no say and/or not respected by many teachers. There has been a lot of turnover and the teachers that are there are not genuine. There is a lot of bullying at lunch and recess which is not managed well or monitored. The parent coordinator runs the whole show and definitely will not go out of her way to listen to a parent and make things right. My child said that if Midtown West had a mascot, it should be the Midtown West Vultures.\nSubmitted by a parent · November 23, 2019', '', 'Sorry to read of your problem but there is more to your story that seems to be left out. How is a five year old in 1st grade? All other first graders are 6 or 7 years old', 'Before we entered Midtown West we\'d met numerous parents of both current and former students who were uniformly ecstatic about their experiences at the school, so we felt those recommendations were sufficient reason to make MTW our first choice. While the school administration (both Ryan and now, Kay) have been solid, and we acknowledge that leadership is one of the keys to success, at the end of the day it really comes down to teachers, and we can\'t say enough about Sarah Hellerstein, our child\'s teacher for kindergarten and first grade.\n\nIf we could have designed a teacher from scratch, it would have been Sarah. She is exactly the right combination of kind and firm and she can switch gears seamlessly as needed. She never loses control of her class either at school or during field trips, and yet she provides plenty of room for kids to move around and be active and engaged in everything they do. A big part of Sarah\'s magic is the way in which she allows young children to be independent and energetic while still maintaining the ability to reel them in when it\'s time to settle down and focus. \n\nFor being relatively young, Sarah exudes confidence and composure and doesn\'t hesitate to deal with students and parents in a manner that is appropriate and always professional. There was never a moment when we doubted whether our son was receiving the best possible education at Midtown West and we would attribute the lion\'s share of that credit to Sarah and her superlative teaching skills. We are hoping the next loop (2nd and 3rd grade) is equally outstanding but we\'d probably be satisfied with even half as good as what we\'ve had thus far!\n\nI should add, by the way, that we have been pleased with virtually every teacher we have encountered at the school, from art to music, as well as all the extended day teachers who work hard to provide our child with a variety of constructive and exciting after school learning experiences. Of course we talk to other parents all the time in every grade and the vast majority are very satisfied with their teachers.\n\nIn terms of overall culture, Midtown West subscribes to the Bank Street philosophy, which attempts to strike a balance between academics and socialization by recognizing that children develop at different ages and phases. It puts the onus on teachers to take into account the unique personality and learning style of each child and avoid the kinds of standardized approaches to teaching that can easily result in all students being painted with a broad brush. \n\nFor parents who plan to start cracking the whip on their kids from the moment they arrive in kindergarten and push them to excel and compete with other children to get ahead of the pack as quickly as possible, Midtown West probably isn\'t the right fit. For parents who place greater emphasis on the emotional and social development of their children, you will feel right at home at Midtown West. MTW isn\'t about constantly comparing your child to all the other children, it\'s about trusting your child to develop at his or her own pace and knowing that the teachers at MTW are skilled at helping ensure he or she can excel and move forward when the time is right.\n\nAnyone reading this or any education blog about NYC public schools probably knows that the primary difference between a ""great"" school and the many average or ""not-so-great"" schools is parent involvement. At Midtown West parent involvement is exceptionally high and the PTA is strong and active, and it shows in the overall success of the school.  A few parents complain that certain other parents are too involved, but we actually feel grateful to those parents who keep their finger on the pulse and help ensure the smooth functioning of the school. Given a choice between parents who were perhaps a bit over-involved, versus parents who didn\'t pay much attention, we\'d take the former every time. Some parents have the time to dedicate themselves to our school and we are grateful for their efforts. \n\nIn terms of academics, Midtown West has a very strong, innovative curriculum that has resulted in our son working several grades ahead in both math and English. While we\'re glad he\'s doing well in those two key subjects that everyone seems to care so much about, we are equally delighted that he excels in play, and art, and music, and various other subjects that make him a well rounded, versatile kid. \n\nIn the final analysis, we feel elementary school should mostly be about having fun and learning to work collaboratively with other students, so we\'re not constantly monitoring the curriculum and worrying whether our son is being properly ""challenged"" (a popular euphemism for ""being pushed hard to excel""). As the Bank Street philosophy suggests, we are confident our son will get to where he needs to be at the appropriate time, and elementary school doesn\'t need to be a crucible that begins the journey to ensure our son gets into Harvard. There will be plenty of time for buckling down on academics in middle and high school and for now we\'re content for him to just be a kid.\n\nIf I can distill everything I\'ve said into one comment, it would be: We couldn\'t be happier at Midtown West!', 'My son has finished this elementary school. He has great memories (especially of the over-night trips), many friendships formed, and he still stops by every now and then on the way back from his current middle school... Many negative comments below I do not find fair. I was indeed voluntarily involved as a parent but not beyond reason: I chaperoned with great pleasure, I made some presentations for MLK day, I contributed financially what I could, my wife cooked and assisted in some dance parties. Academically, the school gave my son a very good background: he is now Arista member, average GPA 96, getting ""double 4s"" on state tests for several years now, good or excellent behavior. About to be tested for the SHSAT... Not to diminish many outstanding teachers of the school, but Tisa Farley certainly stands out as a very genuinely caring of the students for many years. I highly recommend this school...\n\nI just want to add that he was admitted to Stuyvesant High School now, as well as two more boys from his P.S. 212 class...', ""I went to this school back in the early 2000's, man some great memories. Do they still hold the annual field trip to Wollman Rink?"", 'no, that stopped about 5 years ago. Too many accidents.', 'hm sad, but not surprised to hear. The school really changed (from what i hear, some for the better, some for the worse) the last 10 years.', ""As an edit to what I wrote 4 months ago, I'm not a fan of this school. Parental involvement is at an all time high for helicopter parents. There are parents who involve themselves to the point where it's more than necessary. They don't let the teacher do the job they were hired to do. I've spoken to parents, who email or visit the school EVERY day to make sure their child is being treated fairly. That sounds like a parent, who had issues of their own while growing up. You can't be there every second to put your child in a bubble. If MTW allows kids to get bullied on a constant basis by other kids, kids of these helicopter parents, then there is no relief. A school that cherishes parent volunteers, but care nothing for parents who work full time, then we are all in trouble. On the outside it would seem like this school is perfect, but keep in mind that some of the parents, who believe in this perfection are probably volunteering every single day. You can have your own opinions, but there is much going on under the exterior. "", ""I agree. Several over-involved parents have become the face of the school, more so than the principal. There should be a limit though - parents should support, not run the school. Volunteering and fundraising are great, but the almost-daily emails are excessive - I dread seeing yet another reminder. School feels understaffed. The bullying, probably varies from child to child. Unless it's severe, I've stayed out of it - they need to learn just like we did. But there is so much constant disorder and chaos in the school, that I don't see how they can adequately tackle any bullying anyway. "", ""You've chosen to send your child to a school which is very well known for it's parental involvement. This is why people choose the school for their kids. This is why MTW is the great school it is, this is why MTW has so much to offer it's students. Consider it a good thing.

I am the parent of a current student and, yes, Midtown West is a tightly knit community that benefits from a tremendous amount of parent involvement. That said, no-one is being forced to do anything. As the article grudgingly admits, the admissions process is run by the DOE, not the school. Still, it would be disingenuous to pretend that parents don't fund a lot of extras at public schools all over this city. Schools also raise funds from private foundations and public sources. There are a lot of ways for schools to fundraise. And there are a lot of ways for parents to contribute to their child's school. Most of them do not involve writing a check."", ""I think the question is, since the school has no role in enrollment, why are they having prospective families fill out this form? It seems to be designed to discourage certain types of families from considering the school for their child. And even if that isn't the intent, it surely must be a consequence. It makes sense for the school's PTA to solicit that kind of information from enrolled students, but not for the school to solicit that information from prospective applicants."", 'Seriously considering this school if we win the lottery.

He comes home with new books each week and shares how the librarian helped him find a book that interested him.  In addition to weekly trips to the library he also gets weekly art, spanish, music, art, coding, and gym.\n\nI've been on the island for a while and it has been interesting to watch the school develop after the new principal, Ms. Beckman, took over.

02M255,"[""I just wanted to post an update on my son's middle-school admissions results, as I asked in a previous post here about his chances of getting into Salk. He's a general-education student, he ranked Salk first, and he scored a 98.3 on the school's rubric. Knowing how many high-performing students there are in District 2, we as a family remained cautiously optimistic about his chances, as he applied with a perfect report card and state test scores in the low-4s (4.09, 4.11). Sadly, he wasn't offered a seat. My son is bright and curious, and he'll be fine wherever he ends up going to school (waitlists come out next week, so decisions may change). But if the process of applying to middle school has taught our family one thing, it is this: The stakes of high-stakes state testing are even higher now that they are essentially the differential between getting into and being denied a seat at a screened school like Salk. This, of course, will change for next year, as screened schools won't have state test scores to factor into their rubrics. However, when things return to normal for 2021-22 (and will anything ever return to normal?), families applying to middle schools in District 2 should seriously consider what might be decided by how your child performs during those four days of state testing."", ""I'm so happy that the tests were canceled this year and that all these schools and type A parents in D2 will have to contend with _OH MY GOD_ kids without test scores being admitted to schools like Salk. If we really care about ALL students having access to great public education, and we are committed to diversity and equity as we claim to be.. then the test score component should be eliminated as part of the admission rubrics for all schools.Test prep culture is out of control and it is frankly absurd that we think good test scores are anything other than the result of a child having access to test prep in elementary school, or parents who pay for tutoring or offer support. If  we truly want to level the playing field, admit students based on their grades and their teacher comments.  Schools like Salk should desire a rich and diverse student body and the test score component in the rubric is a silent gate keeper."", ""I disagree. Eliminating state test scores from the rubric won't makes schools like Salk more diverse. For general-education students, it will simply reduce the screening process to one based on grades and academic and personal behavior, the only quantifiable elements on a report card (besides attendance/tardiness) that can be fed into a computer to produce a ranking (there are no teacher's comments for screened schools to look at in District 2). This in turn will basically produce a lottery system for the myriad of District 2 students who apply with perfect report cards. Would I have preferred my son had been in such a lottery this year? And would I have thought that more fair? Yes, because then his getting into the school or not wouldn't have depended on how he did on the state tests.

You need to go to the District 2 office, and you need to be extremely demanding. There were a few students who's parents were not demanding that ended up being stuck at MS297. Lab administers a test, but I believe the other schools simply look at the report cards and attendance records."", ""I am an Eighth grader at Salk looking to answer any questions. While looking through the comments, I saw this post from a previous Salkie, and wanted to re-post it so everyone could read it. I agree with many things they said, and have added some notes of my own for all.\n\nHi! I'm an eight grade student at Salk and I've wanted to go to this school since I was in 1st grade. When I found out that I got in I was thrilled. I was nervous for the beginning of the year, being with kids much older than me, but on the very first day I felt immediately welcome. Salk is a small school, which some kids see as a negative thing, and I did too at first, but now I am so thankful for the family vibe that we have here at Salk. I love my teachers. They are all trained professionals who love what they do. I consider them my friends. They are all genuinely concerned about your academic and personal life, if they sense anything wrong with you, they immediately check in with you to make sure that you're okay. I am sad to leave Salk, but I am thrilled and proud with all that I have learned here. Every single teacher helped mold me into the student I am now. I have always wanted to be a performer. I sing and act, and I took part in the drama club for 2 years. However I was extremely unconfident about my singing. My math teacher, Shaun, helped me overcome my fears and I sang in the talent show. I got a standing ovation and I couldn't have done it with out his support. The next day he asked me if I would sing at the haiti fundraiser, and annual fundraiser we have to benefit a school we built in haiti after the tragic earthquake. I accepted and I preformed there. Now I am singing at our graduation and I would NEVER have had the courage to do that if it weren't for him and Amelia, his student teacher. Long story short, the teachers are supportive. Next year I will be attending the Eleanor Roosevelt High School. A school known to be extremely difficult to get into, while 10+ students from Salk got in. Some of my peers are also going to top schools in the state and even the country, i.e. Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Hotchkiss, Beacon, Andover, Saint Anns, and other incredible schools. The school's guidance counselor Leslie is extremely helpful with the high school application process which is incredibly stressful for many students. It is hard for me to put into words my love for this school. My classmates are alert in class and ready to learn from our eccentric and creative teachers and we are excited to see what new teaching method they try out that day. Once we came into class and our teacher gave a us math problems and didn't say a word, he instructed us with his hands and we had to figure out what he wanted us to do, which was to present our problem to the class. He said that he did this because he wanted every child to have the experience of teaching their classmates and he wanted to teach the students to respect their peers, even if the teacher doesn't intervene. I think that a big factor in our Salk family dynamic is respect. It is part of our Core Values, which every student (and teacher) is asked to follow. One of them is to respect those in your community and I think that this particular value is so important because this is one that I see enforced on a daily basis. There is no bullying at this school that I have witnessed. Perhaps 1 or 2 rare cases of some teasing but nothing actually harmful. Students respect teachers, teachers- students, and students other students. Salk has been my home for the last 3 years and I am no doubt going to miss all of my memories here. I love this school and everyone in it and if you are looking for a warm environment with teachers who cater to your specific needs, Salk is the way to go.\n\n*Just to add on to this amazing comment; \nI agree with what they have said full heartedly, and have had many of the same experiences. While I have new teachers, I find that they are engaging and involved. They know each student personally and teach with passion, encouraging every student to use their imagination. We do lots of group work and projects. The workload increases of the three years, but is always manageable and never busy work. We can also come in for lunch or email teachers for help, and if we need an extension (and have a legitimate reason) we can get extensions. We also have amazing clubs like GSA, Green Team, and after-school clubs like Art Portfolio. I am so happy I attend Salk and couldn't imagine going to middle school anywhere else. Everyone is so friendly and I will have formed lasting connections with my friends.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n-Vivian Graham & Anonymous Salkie (Great job at making it into ELRO!!!)\n\n\n:)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to reply with any questions!"", ""Can someone tell me - can you only apply if you're in district 2?"", 'Yes.

02M260,"[""I just wanted to provide a little information for District 2 families who might be applying to Clinton for 6th-grade admissions. My child, a general-education student, scored a 98 out of 100 on the school's rubric (he lost 2 points because he missed three days of school due to illness). He wasn't offered a seat, and he is currently 94th on the school's waitlist. Obviously, he won't be going to Clinton, as there are only 90 seats, with an unknown portion reserved for students with IEPs and 17% reserved for its diversity program.\n\nAs our family went through the process of applying to middle school, we were sometimes thrilled by what we saw as we toured schools and listened to presentations by principals. But we also often heard this: Manage expectations. I hope the information above might help a few families who have general-education students do just that."", 'So what middle school did your child get accepted to with those exceptional grades?', 'Please don\'t send your child to Clinton.  As much as it pains me to say this, as a current parent here this school is appalling in it\'s lack of community and the way the administration treats parents and students.  The IB program is amazing but a number of teachers are unable to teach it, and the administration does nothing to assist. But more importantly this school is rife with unchecked racism and sexual assault/harrassment.  Currently there is an ongoing situation with a very worrying sexual assault that happened on school grounds and the principal has stonewalled any attempt by parents or students to have an assembly, or extra therapists onsite to assist students who are currently upset.  Teachers and counselors have told students to ""get over this tiny incident"" or ""stop blowing it out of proportion"".  When a school body feels unsafe and scared the administrations job is to listen and help them. Instead they have allowed a culture of continued abuse and violence by students and against students.  I wish that I had opted for a different high school and am worried I may have to home school my child.', 'I am currently a Clinton student in the middle school. The MS is tough. I spend around 6-8 hours a weekend on homework and teachers are tough on grading. However, the community is wonderful! My classmates and I help each other through countless amounts of work and keep each other on task. The teachers at Clinton do offer office hours every week so getting help should not be an issue. I am deciding if I should stay at Clinton for HS and I think I will. The IBDP is something that cannot just be thrown away. Anyway, if your student is looking for a challenging school, this is the place to be. PS. Below are some things I have completed in the past years at Clinton: \n15 page essay on Lung Cancer \n70 slide presentation of elevation \nReceived an IB award \nLearned about astronomy(very hard topic) \nCountless thematic and English essays \nLearned how to speak with a teacher\nLearned the power in office hours!!!', ""As a Clinton student just starting the IB this year, I can't begin to explain how difficult this transition has been. One month into the program and I was already seeking outside help. Many teachers are so busy, don't respond to their emails, and have this weird quirk that they can't answer questions during class time. I am struggling and dealing with 80s in many of my classes after having been in high honor roll in 9th and 10th grade. This school needs to offer more help to students individually. IB is hard!! We are new to this!! We need all the help we can get. Seriously."", 'As a parent, I’ve got to say I agree with everything you say.  I can’t comment on how available or helpful the teachers are since I’m not in the classroom.  (Typically, I’ve found Clinton teachers to be of a high quality.) I imagine the teachers are pretty overwhelmed. One of the things I didn’t like during this transition is the switch to student-led conferences (nothing to do with IB). We would have found it more helpful to be able to speak to teachers individually to get a handle of what was happening with our student in each class (particularly given students and teachers were contending with a brand new curriculum).  We’re glad that Clinton resumed using Jupiter Grades.  Last year’s Jump Rope was ineffective and made it very difficult to know how students were doing, sometimes until it was far too late.  Students in an 11th and 12th grade are expected to be able to advocate for themselves.  That’s all well and good, but these kids still need scaffolding.  (Again, this is particularly true given the new curriculum).  I don’t think the orientation to the IB for parents was sufficient.  Yes, of course, there were sessions for parents that provided an overview.  But, the nitty gritty of IB was not conveyed.  I expect it will get better for future classes.  I hate complaining, but I was disappointed that there was not more support for these inaugural IB classes.', 'What\'s up with Clinton\'s website?

It only focused on work that won’t prepare for your future.', 'Have you spoken to your teachers or college counselors about the issues are having?  Hopefully, they can provide you with guidance.

02M276,"['I graduated from this school 4 years ago and to this day some of the experiences that had happened to me still haunt me to this day. I went into  middle school coming out of a very rough experience at elementary school with my standards very low, and unfortunately this school only hurt me more. I was bullied mercilessly all 3 years I attended and felt as if I had no allies. When I went to the school about some of my problems it either did not stop or only made things worst. It has taken me years to recover from many of the cruel things my classmates said about me, and the worst part was I was not the only one who felt this. The administration would do little to nothing to stop fights and ignore major issues within the grades, for example one of the kids in my grade was going around and grouping girls, and while this was brought up to the school multiple times the issue still continued. The environment of the school was extremely cliquey and very unforgiving academically, which drew many of my friends to become borderline suicidal which was only perpetuated by the administration that would actively  target them. While The experience was negative, I feel its fair to say what the school did right during my time there, for example most of the teachers really did care about what they taught and I found some of my favorite teachers there that still inspire me to learn. One of the main draws of the school is its small class sizes which can be a double edged sword, however it made classes feel a lot more personable and teachers always knew your name. While the academic environment can be ruthless it prepared me well for high school and college and it never felt unfair. I feel that I should state that my experience is not representative of the whole school and that I graduated a while ago so things might be very different now than it was back then. It is sad because I came into this school with so much hope only for it to just tear me down, but at the same time I can see why people love it. At the end of the day is it a good school academically? yes. Is it a good school socially? from my experience no, however I have kept in touch with some of my former classmates that look upon our years there fondly. I hope that this school has learned how to handle situations like grouping, bullying and violence far better than they did when I was there, and I wish nothing but the best for the faculty.', ""Any feedback on the middle school here and their exmissions?  We have kids in the k-5 and while half of the teachers have been great, there's more than a few that was more than lackluster.  Particularly in 3rd grade, when the homework grades don't seem to reconcile to the report grades.  When asking the teacher about this, she can't seem to clearly articulate how she can give homework grades that are stellar and yet report grades that are less so.  There's also a tech teacher who can't seem to make out a sentence properly which is concerning.  Would love to hear from other parents & students about this school's middle school program."", 'Kids who graduated in 2019 went to Stuy, LaGuardia, Brooklyn Tech, Millenium, Clinton, Regis and many other desirable schools. I don’t know of one kid who did not end up going to a great school. I felt the teachers were really uneven and, as with the elementary school, information was not forthcoming. However, ultimately my child was well prepared for high school. The only big adjustment was the homework! My child rarely had any at 276 and now goes to a school That gives a lot.', 'First grade general and special education teacher Tara Hines of Battery Park City School was recognized for her determination to meet each of her students\' individual needs at the 2019 <a href=""http://blackboardawards.com/"">Blackboard Awards</a>.', ""My daughter attended PS 276 from Kindergarten through 5th grade and I couldn't be happier with the education she received. When she was struggling, her teachers recognized it immediately and worked with her to get back on course. EVERY teacher that she had was incredible, professional, focused on learning and cared about every student equally. The Principal (Terri Ruyter) runs a 'tight ship' and never missed a morning to greet parents and children at school arrival. She always has her door open, responds to emails/inquiries immediately and it was very apparent how much she cared about the students and the school. When we as a community were faced with an act of terrorism last year, I felt confident that my child was safe in her care during a very stressful, horrific situation. I can't say enough great things about 276 and even when faced with difficulties (ie large classrooms' etc), they always made the best of the situations and came thru them with positive results. I highly recommend 276 and in my opinion having gone to a public school as a child, 276 is in MANY ways equivalent to a private school in terms of learning, discipline, caring and daily routines. We miss 276 and it will forever be apart of our lives with many great memories. We thank every teacher, staff member and Principal Teri for the amazing learning experience."", 'I went to IS 276 for about 3 years. I am currently a High school freshmen when I post this. This school has about 30 students per class, 2 to 3 classes per grade. The hallways are very narrow so going to classes are difficult. The hallways get very packed, almost like a mosh pit. This mainly happens when students are getting to classes and dismissal. The stairs are big but students are required to walk up 24 steps to get to 1 floor. Also, the stairs, like the halls, get packed after lunch and recess and dismissal.   Middle-schoolers would chant curses in the stairs when the elementary students are in the staircase. The middle school mainly uses the 7th and 8th floor, and the elementary school is separated. I think that the kids in the school don\'t respect each other. They call you names like ""f***t, r****d, n****r, gay, etc."" Bullying is also common, but it\'s more verbal and rumor spreading. You can be in the bathroom stall and people will start throwing wet paper towels at you when you are trying to go. The bathrooms are a mess, especially the boy\'s room. Puddles of urine are very common. Toilet paper will always be out, mainly from kids throwing them around or urinating on them. I once walked into the bathroom and someone pooped in the sinks, disgusting. What disgusts me the most is that kids drew hate symbols, the nazi swastika, in the boy\'s bathroom, twice in my last year. Adding on to hate, some students would joke about racist stereotypes, some might find it offensive. The kids do not physically fight each other. The school claims to be green, which I agree is, but kids do not care about recycling and throw their waste anywhere they want. I\'ve seen food stays with liquids and food thrown in recycling bins. But, there is a handful of students who do not clean up after themselves. When the principal addressed this issue, she said ""I don\'t care if you recycle just throw out your freaking trash!"". The teachers at the school are nice and friendly. But, there is always the one teacher who comes to punch their card and wait for the day to end. I learned nothing in math last year, since one the teachers did not show up for half of the year. She didn\'t look like she enjoyed teaching and always looked angry. Usually when their is a sub, the class will go out of control. Kids would throw things, scream, stick pencils in the ceiling, and play offensive music with their speakers. There are also teachers who cannot control the class. I learned nothing in science since the kids would do whatever they wanted. Eventually she left toward the end of the year. Also, I had a teacher who threatened to fail the whole class if you do not do the things she wanted you to do. Academically wise, the school is successful. The school has high expectations per students and teachers push students to go above and beyond. Teachers help students become aware of their grades by handing out progress reports. The only thing I do not like is how math classes are separated. There is thee advanced math class that learns math a grade level ahead and the regular common core math class. The advanced math class was the only class that took the regents exam and gained early high-school credits, leaving majority of the 8th grade body behind. However, I think some teachers are very opinionated and less effort on the students they dislike. I also teachers are very bias and teach students their political beliefs. Last year was the presidential election, and all I heard was Clinton support from every-teacher. In one class, a teacher spent the whole class explaining why Clinton is better than Trump. But, I think majority of the students are Trump supporters (I am one as well). There are also radical liberal students; I remember I saw a poster on the wall that showed trump as an orange (fruit) and it said ""I want this out of office"". It was there even after a group wanted it to be taken down. The school has many LGBTQ teachers. There is a LGBTQ club during lunch time for students. The teachers accept students of many genders, sexuality, races, and cultures. The principle doesn\'t believe in punishment, so many incidents can slide.. If they fight, it\'s usually outside of the building. Overall, I wouldn\'t recommend this school because of the toxic environment the kids made.

Her teachers Kristin and Nicole are an elite group of teachers that do an incredible job teaching the entire class, getting all students involved and truly bringing out the best of each and every student and the entire class.  They focus on instilling confidence, and growing and maximizing the abilities of every student.  The class is a very warm and welcoming setting and every child enjoys and appreciates the environment so much that they fit right in and focus on all the subjects taught in class.  Students also work together and they develop teamwork skills, every student truly learns how to positively work together.  Students also take this positive energy and valuable disciplines home with them that they look forward to doing their homework and making plans after school and on the weekends with friends they made through school.  They become excellent students, outgoing and socially responsible.  \n\nOur daughter had such a wonderful experience her 1st year at The River School that she was a returning student this year. 1st grade didn't quite get off to the same start as kindergarten, perhaps because she missed having Nicole and Kristin as her teachers, however it turned out that our daughter was very fortunate to have Amy and Erika as her 1st grade teachers. I got to know Amy and Erika very well throughout the school year, and they had an incredible effect on our daughter's education, and truly getting to know her.  Amy and Erika are fully dedicated to every child, the curriculum taught in class, and are awesome teachers. They fully understand every child, and are extremely valuable at getting to know every student, and bringing every student up to speed so that they excel and perhaps even overachieve as Isabella is currently doing.  Isabella was invited to be apart of the River Rise Program and we credit this program for our daughter making significant progress and the improvement she has.  We are very proud of Isabella and are forever grateful for the support that The River School(class teachers/other educators/support staff), grants, the DOE, and especially the PTA have extended to our daughter and all children and families throughout The River School.  \n\nThe school our children attend is highly important because it affects who our children are today and who they will become. From my experience and perspective The River School has the best teachers, and the teachers welcome all student families to their classroom every Family Friday. The teachers also keep parents fully in the loop what goes on in the classroom daily by sending class emails, and also gives us parents the ability to stay involved which is incredibly important for our children's well-being and success.  Not only has our daughter benefited from The River School, our family has benefited significantly as a whole.  I feel I personally have gotten a lot out of The River School that I find extremely rewarding with a great sense of achievement and satisfaction that will last a lifetime.\n\nTeachers and staff truly look forward to working here and it shows in their every day care and passion for their students to be comfortable in their own skin and succeed happily. It's also a safe environment and the facilities are perhaps the best in the city. We are very fortunate to have what we have. The atmosphere and environment is very friendly and since it's a small school everyone pretty much knows everyone and everyone is very welcoming and caring. I've become very close with many of the parents that I consider them great friends. I feel very pleased bringing our daughter to school every day knowing she's in the best of hands.

I lived in Tudor City and loved the neighborhood, but regrettably, I had to move in order to ensure that my son would get a good elementary school education and actually enjoy school.  So, I moved 10 blocks up so he could attend PS59.  My son had his first day of First Grade at PS59 today, and it was so remarkably different!  It was\nunbelievable.  To start, just waiting outside the doors to PS59 in the mayhem of all the children lining up with their classes, you could sense a positive energy flowing through both the parents and the children.  You could see the older children happy and excited to be back at school, which I think is a reflection of their school experience.  This was a stark contrast to the progressively lethargic attitude my son developed towards school over the course of his Kindergarten year at PS281.  It was so sad to see the enthusiasm for school deflate in a child who absolutely loved preschool and pre-K in the two years prior to Kindergarten.  It broke my heart.  That is when I knew I had to move.  Secondly, in the paperwork that came home in my son’s backpack today, there was a letter from the PS59 librarian in which she shared that she had purchased new books for the library that had been requested by the children, she was looking forward to working with the children this year, and she encouraged the children to take home books and share them with their families. Again, this is a huge contrast to the attitude at PS281.  PS281 had a brand new, beautiful, fully stocked and catalogued library that was never used by the children until a few weeks before the school year ended.  The reason: \nthe principal’s goal for the library was “to preserve the books.”  So, she didn’t want the children to use the library or touch the books.  This, coming from the principal who claimed that literacy was her #1 priority.  Needless to say, the parents were in an uproar about the students not being able to enjoy their school library.  Through heated debates with the principal in PTA meetings and a massive push by the parent body, the children were finally allowed to go into the library once every two weeks to check out one book towards the end of the school year.  So, the children got to enjoy the library for a few weeks before school ended, but only after a huge war had been waged by the parents.  That whole episode was painful, disheartening, and frankly, unbelievable.  How refreshing to now be at a school where the children are welcomed into the\nlibrary!  Finally, one of my greatest frustrations with PS281 was the lack of commitment and teaching as it relates to basic academics.  It became clear very early on that my son was not being taught how to properly form letters, how to sound out words (use phonics), how to read, or how to do basic math.  When I talked to other PS281 Kindergarten parents, they were all observing the same issues with their children.  In talking with other District 2 parents, it became clear that the Kindergarten students of PS281 were way behind their\npeers in other District 2 schools.  This was just unacceptable.  As a parent body\nwe tried very hard to raise these issues with the teachers and principal through the PTA channel, but our concerns fell on deaf ears.  Parents gradually checked out.  This was evident at the last General PTA meeting, where only one parent attended who was not a PTA Executive Board member.  While moving to a new apartment this summer and transferring my son to a new school was a hassle and disruptive, I am so glad I did it.  When I picked up my son from school today, he was so excited and eager to tell me all about it… I can see the sparkle in his eye and that “love of school” that he had prior to PS281 returning to him, and that makes it all worthwhile.', 'The district finally listened to the parents - there is a new principal here for 2014-2015 school year!!!  Too bad the change came to late for me and the 17 other families I know of who moved to get away from this mess of a school.  It can only improve from here.', 'This school is not warm at all, they treat the kids like they don\'t know what is a kid. They gave a lot of time out, sometimes even for an all recess and this was just for kindergarten. Personally my kid never had some but my kid was concern by the way some of her classmates were constantly punish for nothing. They but a very unfriendly and tense relationship. They broke their self esteem by ""labeling"" them constantly with their red / green choices. The social emotional way to handle the kids is really not that great. About academics they do the standard activities,this is how it is the lacks of creativity seems to be an issue in most of the schools in this city Now it\'s just about literacy and math. Parents want 5year old who reads and does addition and subtraction the common core supports those ideas that is really sad but that is how it is. What can we do ? The kids learned nothing just snap words and addition subtraction of everything memorizing same that any parents can do with flash cards.  \nWe are part of the 30% of parents who decide to leave the school and take a chance in another one, more friendly , less pushy and progressive. But at the same time  we don\'t have that much illusion. \nBut honestly they are doing the same thing than in most of the public schools around here , they just have less money for field trips and special activities just give money to the PTA and you will have same school as ps 116 or midtown westps 40 ... Not better but with a ""nicer package"" ', 'As a current parent, I agree with previous posts. The building is beautiful but lacks in every other way: leadership, curriculum, enrichment, community building, teacher/staff experience, etc. The DOE and this school have failed the community and D2 at large. Sadly, our kids are the ones paying for it. Time to move out of the zone and into a better one.', 'Being that this school is new and there\'s not much data to go on for new parents, I would like to provide some comments as a current parent. The leadership in this school does not exist. There is no leadership. The environment/curriculum (or lack there of) is what we as parents would like to see in a preschool for our little ones learning what it is to go to \'school.\' The principal\'s vision is warm and fuzzy with academics as the last priority. She cares more about being liked and being your friend than making sure she creates a school where our kids will be academically sound and/or prepared for the road ahead. Physical education is non-existent unless you don\'t mind your child having yoga once a week. Math curriculum...instruction or group discussions is held once a week which is not up to par with our neighboring schools. Teachers are great, well at least my child\'s teacher is, not sure about the rest, but because of the ""vision"" and controlling hierarchy, they do not teach a vigorous curriculum. So yes your child will be loved and greeted during drop-off and dismissal but no he/she will not know what 2+2 is, what ""field day"" means, or what hands on science is all about. All in all, the majority of the parents are extremely disappointed to the point where its easier to just move and leave the apartment you\'ve been living in for so long than to try and give your two sense to the principal and expect to be heard.', 'I have a kid currently enrolled in this school in Kindergarten. \nthere are 2 kindergarten classrooms and 2 part time prek.\none has  26 kids with 2 teachers. this a special ed co teaching classroom. and another one 24 kids with one teacher and an aid.\nThey start the day with the pledge in the classroom some family ask for it only a few weeks ago. During the week the kids have once a week music, yoga ( that the only physical activity offer), Art and sciences in the STEAM lab where parents can volunteer, library twice a month where parents can volunteer and kids borrow one book. \nthe kids had only two field trip one in the children museum of Art another to see a show the hiccup paper bags... \nParents ask the school to buy an oven for cooking project which they do but they never use it. \nthe drop off is in the lobby ( not in the classroom) and they go line up in the cafetaria and go in their classroom, (except for the prek) which was very traumatic for a lot of kids and also frustrated for parents no being able to see the art work or classroom project when coming to drop off or pick up kids. they have family friday once a month where parents are allow to stay in the classroom to observe theire kids or do activity with kids.\nThe playground is covered due to construction and it will be for several years. They will have a small playground in the front of entrance of school but it\'s not ready yet. Both playgrounds are pretty small we still don\'t have a clue how they are going to manage with more classrooms.\nthe atmosphere is quite cold you are allow to communicate by phone call and note in the folder. to have an appointment with the teacher you need to heavily insisted and usually they have 15min no more. we had two parents teachers conferences where they do an overview of your kid but they don\'t give you a write report. We also had a report card only once.\nThe curriculum of the school is vague, the principal said she is more Bank Street spirit so you will maybe assume that the school would be more progressive but not really. It seems parents expect totally different things some expect play base, discovery, creativity and cultural awareness, other just want academics and no playtime. But the school seems to have hard time to take an orientation trying to ""pleased"" everybody. So of course it\'s not really working and a lot of parents complain and try to find other options for next year.\nfor reading they used a balance literacy way ( phonics awareness and whole language mix) but at the end it seems that the kids just learn sight /snap words by heart and try to find them in books, they also use pattern books with picture to make the kids guess the words. A lot of parents seem concern because they don\'t see improvement in their kid reading skill. they also bother the kids a lot with the Lucy Calkins method of writing workshop, the kids are supposed to draw a picture and after write a sentence under with no help. 26 kids no writers at the kids time with 2 teachers trying to help. \nfor the Math it\'s the same they repeated the same games over and over. \nwe think there is a lack of project they have only a few inquiries since the beginning of the year ( all about me, about feelings and about the school). we don\'t think this school rock at all :(\ni can\'t really say that we like the school but every parent expect different things so maybe it seems nice for others.\n\n\n\napologies for typo and rest english is not my first language.', 'Those are very legitimate concerns. All work in progress. The classrooms are primarily south facing so noise from the construction is supposed to be mitigated - but still rumbling trucks and equipment do go on which creates noise and dust. Classroom windows are closed for the most part so that helps. We have had no crossing guard all year (imperative for the very busy First Ave intersection) - the school has had the job posting up with the 17th precinct since almost the beginning of the school year with zero results. Both playgrounds are scaffolded so presumed safe. PTA purchased Imagination Playground for inside use in the gym due to the above concerns. \n\n\nThis school (aside from being physically attractive) is a work in progress as a whole. The curriculum is geared toward EQ and not enough IQ.  And that is not an opinion - that was expressed to the families from the start. It misses the point that in this age of competition both locally and globally, a more rigorous curriculum is required. The kids can handle it.  And the parents overwhelmingly support it.  Why lower the bar?  A more seasoned administrator might have made this school work from the start.  But sadly it seems like it will have to learn the hard way through trial and error.  And maybe the exit of some families looking for a better option.']"
02M289,"['As a current Freshman who graduated from IS 289 in June 2019, I can say that I regret going there. While the teachers deeply care about each of their students, they also lack many basic skills. Teachers didn\'t update grades for many months, and hardly ever returned graded papers. Additionally, the curriculum is far too easy. In 6th grade math, we learned how to subtract fractions on a number line, which I learned in the beginning of third grade. This may be attributed to the fact that IS 289 is a ""magnet school,"" and my grade consisted of kids from Brooklyn, China Town, Chelsea, West Village, and Washington Heights. 289 prides itself on ""inclusivity"" and ""not having advanced classes"" but it is necessary to receive a good education! In fact, when a group of peers in my grade talked the the principal about starting a Student Council so kids could discuss these issues openly, she said that it would be ""too competitive"" and ""teachers wouldn\'t want to participate."" (Note, when I spoke to 8th grade teachers, they were more then happy to assist us!) The curriculum across all grades is far too simple, and left us ill prepared for High School. When I talked to my 6th grade teachers AND my principal about getting harder work, nothing was offered to me, not even the Khan Academy password so I could learn on my own!! No grammar, vocab or annotation skills taught, no grammar or conjugations in Spanish, and the math curriculum was easy, although I did hear that it\'s getting revamped. There is an algebra regents program for mathematically inclined students, however, the class meets AFTER SCHOOL. We were essentially taking two math courses, meaning double the homework, double the tests and double the stress, especially during the fall of 8th grade with high school applications! As someone who received 90\'s or above across the board, did I ever receive constructive criticism on my work? Nope! Always ""Keep up the great work!"" which is nice to hear, but how does that allow growth? Additionally, art programs were horrible, and apparently the art teacher from last year left and nobody took her place. The hallways are a hellhole especially in the 6th grade hallways, with kids being shoved and teachers screaming at the top of their lungs in anger, which reinforces their behavior. The dress code was targeted towards females, and was way too strict. Despite this, there are some AMAZING teachers, namely the 8th grade science teacher and the 7th grade social studies teacher. Also, the school does a great job discussing race and bias, and the GSA is a strong club with many members and a great leader. All in all, IS 289 has great potential. With a revamped math and Spanish curriculum, greater teacher standards, more difficult work in 6th grade, and more school spirit, I believe that IS 289 could become one of the best schools in District 2!', ""289 has some of the nicest facilities in D2, in part down to a post-911 grant that means the school is well funded. It's small - 3 classes per grade. It's clean and classrooms are bright and airy. Kids have lockers and out-lunch beginning in 7th grade which my daughter enjoyed. At time of writing there is no art or music in the curriculum. The art teacher left in 2019 and wasn't replaced. The principal is reaching out to parents to help implement an art program. Music (Orchestra) is only available as an after-school activity. Other middle schools offer electives. 289 does not and it's a shame as the kids could really use some light relief. While project-based, the curriculum is pretty gray and joyless. Parent-teacher conferences are child-driven, a progressive idea that is excellent in theory, but the reality is that your child reads from a sheet of paper, while their academic coach types up notes and asks if you have questions at the end. With the exception of curriculum night, you do not get to meet your child's core teachers unless you request a meeting and the teachers are hard to pin down. The teachers are by and large unenthusiastic and do not respond to emails. 7th grade teachers are not generous with their grading which negatively impacts kids applying to public high schools in 8th grade. Think GPAs in the low 80s compared to the high 90s regularly given out to other middle school pupils that your child will be competing against. Despite enjoying her time at 289 where she was popular and made friends, both my daughter and I agree if we could do-over we would not send her to 289. Uninspiring, from the principal down."", 'IS 289 has so many things going for it: new facility with spacious hallways, safe location close to public transportation, friendly & approachable female administration, diverse student population (compared to some other D2 middle schools), a progressive, project-based curriculum and some really excellent teachers.\n\nThe Science and Social Studies curricula are innovative and engaging.  Students learn about real world problems (ie climate change, discrimination, social identity), set goals with Coaches and also independently, work collaboratively with other students to develop solutions and frequently reflect on their experiences.  They learn how to research and complete long term projects.  Through this process, students become passionate young advocates for themselves and others.  IS289 curriculum infuses these important practical life skills!\n\nI applaud this school for their commitment to inclusion of all people and racial equity at this school.  The Gender Sexuality Alliance club is open to all 7th & 8th graders and meets weekly during lunch.  It is a very popular club among all students and led by a strong & experienced teacher.  Additionally, Facing History framework is woven into the curriculum.  And, the administration is creating a “Race & Equity Team” to address and maintain a focus on race & bias work in the school.  \n\nWhile the curriculum at the school is thoughtful and empowering, and while overall, the school does a very good job tending to the social/emotional lives of middle school students (Evidenced by classroom time devoted to healthy relationships, healthy media habits, substance abuse, thorough & caring response to 10/31/17 acts of terror at Chambers and West Side Highway) and while many kids seem to graduate with solid friendships, the overall success of IS289 students is limited due to mediocrity in other areas. \n\nHere are thé negatives: some teacherS RARELY reply to emails (from parents or students) and others take monthS to update students grades in the online grading platform.  Teachers RARELY return graded work with teacher comments or feedback.  These delays or gaps in the “feedback loop of teaching” actually DISempower students and cause frustration, ambivalence and resentment among students, and compromise students learning.  Do teachers not have enough enough time to complete these basic tasks?  \n\nIn the past, 6th grade teachers have not provided more challenging work, even when the student asks for it.  This issue was raised to teachers & principal, yet my student saw no change during the 2016-17 school year.  \n\nWe are glad to hear the Math curriculum is being revamped — because that is needed.   This past year, 8th grade Algebra took place after school twice a week (last year, it wasn’t even offered AT ALL) and those students must ALSO take 8th grade Math, during the school day.  So, IS 289 demands extra Math hours in the fall of 8th grade just as families are running to visit prospective high schools, and in some cases writing supplemental essays or studying for the SHSAT.   Some parents say the IS289 Math curriculum does not prepare kids for SHSAT.  Some parents say it does not prepare kids for 9th grade Math (again, compared to other D2 middle schools).  MANY families spend extra hours and dollars on private tutoring to score well on the various state/standardized tests (even if student is not taking SHSAT) to bolster their chances of getting into a « top » high school.  \n\nLiteracy is based on Teachers College method which works well for some students.  No grammar is taught.  Neither Spelling or vocabulary are not areas of focus.  Again, some families are concerned about being prepared for 9th grade English.  Note, very little time devoted to ELA test prep.  \n\nWhile PE is strong, Spanish is disappointing (again, NO grammar or verb conjugations are taught) and leaves students ill prepared for Spanish II in high school. \n\nAlso, this school has a dress code and teachers do enforce it (many female students will say it unfairly targets them).  Neither School spirit among students nor parent involvement is particularly strong.  \n\nSo, overall, while there are many strengths at this school — teachers and members of the staff DO really CARE about the students —  many students in the 2018-19 class do not seem satisfied with their experience at IS289.   Our hope is there will be more changes (in addition to Math curriculum) at IS289, so the school, staff and future students can fulfill their potential.', 'We too thought that this school seemed warm and inviting when we toured it. However, looks can be very deceiving.  One month into 6th grade and my child began complaining that the work was too easy, that there was nothing new or challenging or just simply taught by any of the teachers. Fast forward another year and it\'s the same story. The teaching is abysmal. Assessments last year and this year are a joke - create an ""artifact""...write down something on a 3x5 index card... and how are these graded you ask! Who knows! In 7th grade ELA, kids are suppose to write every week; so, my child wrote every week. But was anything read or reviewed? Was he provided feedback so that the writing could improve? Was anything sent home so that we could see it? Did the teacher respond to any emails for clarification? NOPE. Same with math and science. Grades aren\'t posted for months. Responses to emails - you may or may not receive one.  Kids are bullied and no one does anything about it. Several parents have discussed this and yet nothing nothing nothing happens. Neither the Assistant Principal nor the Principal want to deal with these issues at all. \n\nSo, yes, this school looks great from the outside as well as neat,  clean and shiny on the inside. But it\'s just a hollow shell. There is no learning happening here.', 'I enjoyed an inviting, warm and peaceful tour today with my 10 year old son at Hudson River.  The children seemed very engaged, attentive, and friendly.  I noticed the school even had a poster that indicated they instill advocacy within the school.  However, during a presentation given by the principal towards the end of the tour I decided to ask a question.  I asked "" Are the children accessible to an avenue within the school which promotes a mindset of being of service to their community, and society not just on a broad scale, such as within the curriculum,  but a day to day level within the communities they are closely amongst?""  The principal responded very kindly, it\'s not mandatory, and began explaining how social activism is integrated within the curriculum, which I saw on the pamphlet and I was very pleased to see.  Then she expressed how hard it would be to find an organization that would welcome 100 middleschoolers to volunteer!  In conclusion, what this showed me about Hudson River was this school has never thought or believed they could achieve incorporating community service and volunteering as an essential part of the social aspect of education by establishing a group within the school that would promote and allow the children to have access to voluntarily offer themselves (since it\'s not mandatory) to be of service in their city to different organizations in New York.  As a society we can do better within the school system to instill the importance of serving others as much as possible!  On another note,  It was nice to hear the school collects things to donate for the holidays!', ""As a student, I agree that, yes, there could be more emphasis on community service, but it's not that the school hasn't thought of it. I think that for a small school, the school does a good job offering a decent amount of programs. This is just the tradeoff for going to a school of this size."", 'IS 289 is also known as the Hudson River Middle School, the <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/nyregion/children-lower-manhattan-terror-attack-saipov.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&action=click&contentCollection=nyregion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=1>New York Times reports</a>.', ""All I have to say about this school is that the school is not good nor good. The reasons of that is because we learn absolutely nothing in all the years of the school. It's a good thing that it is a place where people felt treated. There are a LOT signs of bullying and I think that it is a bad thing. If you would like to come here just to feel safe this is a school that may help. If you want to come here for academic purposes, I would rate it like 5/10. There is an alegbra regents in 8th grade and which we learn a little from. Other problem is that sometimes I won't understand something in regents. Thank you very much for reading this."", ""As a student of Is289, I personally feel like this school is HORRIBLE. Please do not ever come to this bad school! A few reasons for me saying this is because the academics are so bad, people are constantly getting bullied by peers( I can tell from my experience), and the teachers are usually unclear, and sometimes can be biased towards certain types of people, regarding race, money, and how smart you are. What we learn in 6th grade is so laughable, multiplication, fractions, ratios, etc.. all that I've learned in 4th to 5th grade! Sometimes the teachers just let us do whatever we want, and the hallways are NEVER safe. People are constantly fighting for their lockers to get to class on time, and sometimes the weaker kids are late for people that are casually playing around. I also have seen several kids getting bullied, with no one standing up for them, even though in Advisory, we try to stop bullying.( Clearly none of the lessons have stuck onto the kid's heads). I have made the mistake of my life coming here, being lead by misleading and false lies that the school had put up."", ""Right now I'm in 8th grade in this school and so far, I don't regret coming here. There's a music program where you can play classical instruments and have two concerts       -one in the winter and one in the summer- and you start learning Spanish in 7th grade. I think the best year is 8th because all the teachers in this grade is very nice and you can joke and talk about other things with them. But I struggled a lot during my first two years. In 7th grade, you have to write 3 entries a week in literacy. The entries have to be 2-3 pages long and by the end of the week, you should have at about 10 pages of work. The entries can be about anything you want. I find this ridiculous because it's suppose to help you with your state ela exam but it did nothing to me other than make me get bad grades (I didn't do so well back then). It got way better for me in 8th grade because you don't have to write the entries and instead you do work that actually matter and is useful like drafting poems and article works. You have to do a lot of reflection work and you have to have a portfolio starting from 6th grade. You don't actually learn much during Spanish and from what I see, most kids act up and disrespect the Spanish teacher the most. The food here actually isn't that bad and there's water so that's nice. We also have art, but it's not that interesting. If you have music, you don't get to have as much time in P.E. or small groups. You also have to lead your parents teacher conference (depending on who your advisory teacher is). There's also coaching, where a teacher is your coach and you both decide on what goals you have and what you want to improve on. But there are some kids who never did get coach for a while. I only got two coaching sessions last year and that was towards the end of the year. But I did get coach in 6th grade and my coach now isn't bad.\n One interesting thing you might want to know if you are thinking about applying to this school is that we (the whole 8th grade) hate the 7th graders. Most of them are annoying and rude, cursing and disrespecting anyone and everyone. There's also rumors that a kid in 7th grade smoked one of those e-cigs in math class. A fight also broke out last year when I was in 7th grade and them in 6th. But that's only in the 7th grade now. The 6th graders aren't that bad. It's only the 7th graders the 8th grade hates."", ""My child s MS coordinator isn't sure if you have to put this 1st. I put this 1st or 2nd.

My doctor advised me to use the elevator and limit walking. One day I was having a flare up and the nurse wasn’t there during her lunch break and didn’t have a substitute. I went to the nurses office with a student that had an allergic reaction, with a throat closing and another student with a high fever. The elevator stopped at the second floor (where we were) with the school Dean inside and I told him I have a back injury and I showed him my bright red pass and he told me to take the stairs. I told him while the elevator closed I almost broke my spine and head so taking the stairs isn’t an option for my injury and he didn’t care. Also I had two students that were severely sick and nobody even cared not even the nurses assistant who was watching tv in the office. While a student struggling to breath and the other student gets very light headed and I cry on the floor in pain. Then finally a teacher with an elevator pass comes and we are relieved that someone can help us now but instead he says you can’t stay here take the stairs.

Favorite teachers from our daughter (LOL): Danielle in Science, Yashira in Drama, Theresa in English. They have Advisory three times per week and we love that there seems to be an effort to focus on the kids being good/nice, helpful, collaborative. We heard there is a mindfulness coach and we'd like to know more about that. Teachers use JumpRope for grading report and it's useful - we just started using it so we're still new but it seems like a very good tool to keep track of our daughter's progress and activities in class. The parent coordinator, Jill, is also very helpful and responds to emails quickly. In sum so far so great."", 'I have a child coming in with an IEP.

Apparently, there have been a lot of new hires to keep hallways free of students wandering around and a new bell system has been installed.', 'I too recently toured the school and my insight is entirely hearsay (from a 7th grade tour guide). I had seen the NYP article about the renegade teacher, as well as the not-great (to put it mildly) inside school survey results that make the school sound like Attica. I asked this 7th grader (a boy) if he felt safe in school, and whether there was a lot of fighting. The look on his face was of innocent confusion. He asked me to clarify: Did I “mean trash-talking while playing sports?” I said “no, like fist fights.” He again looked very confused and said “no....I haven’t seen any fights. I don’t know where that would happen.” My intuition tells me he wasn’t coached to lie, but genuinely had never seen this type of behavior in his school. I then asked around to a couple other parents and they said that because the grades are split up into 3 bungalows each, you become very insulated within your specific bungalow. So if your bungalow has bad apples, you could have a bad experience. If the kids are attentive and responsible, you’ll have a great experience. Again, all underpinned by testimony from current 7th grader!', ""After putting up with this place an entire year, I finally managed to get my kids transferred out a few weeks into this school year. I have not posted any prior reviews because there are so many problems with this school that I did not know where to begin. Keep in mind that while the majority of students panned 75 Morton on the surveys last year, the negative opinions are not shared by 100% of the students. Students who do not love this school will not volunteer as tour guides to promote it! Any student who is oblivious to the fights must not be paying much attention. Fights last year broke out in the hallways and at recess. My kids witnessed and heard about fights between kids within their classes and from different bungalows. A fight actually broke out in one of the classes during the NY state ELA test. The students are not the problem. It's bad policy. However, I think the bigger problem is the anti-academic attitude of the administration. Although they will never admit it, they deliberately impede the progress of the top students. It is rooted in their belief that all students need to be equal. Since it is not feasible to make the struggling students catch up if all the students are moving forward, they need to hold back those who are too far ahead in order to help close the gap. However, many parents who can afford it hire private tutors outside the school so that their kids continue getting 4's on the state tests. 75 Morton needs to come with a long, detailed warning label, but instead, the administration aggressively covers up the negatives. There are countless stories (examples: a student kicking a 3 foot hole in the stairwell wall, students going to the hospital after consuming chocolate laced with 'an illicit substance,' etc.) but website comments have space limitations."", 'There was a negative post here about the school environment at Morton, which is why I posted above looking to hear about others experiences.

I believe he's sincere, but his experiences are in no way indicative of the kind of school this is. My understanding is that he wanted his children to go a school like Salk and when they didn't get in and had to come to Morton, instead of accepting the difference in pedagogy, he insisted the school change to be more like the school he had wanted his children to go to. That isn't to say Morton is perfect, but Jacqui is great and the school, while still experiencing growing pains, is in good hands."", '""had quite a reputation"" -- nice smear from an anonymous account.  Gutsy. \n\nI know several people whose kids attend Morton currently or who attended it for one year before bailing before 7th grade.  Every one of them expresses the same views that Lawrence has expressed here.  Students capable of advanced learning are bored and progressing slowly, especially in math.  Safety and classroom chaos is a big concern.  They\'re angry and sad about how this school has turned out for them.', ""The specific request was to allow 6th and 7th grade students who are strong in math the option to work on material 1 year ahead of their grade level. This is hardly an unreasonable request, since more than half the middle schools in the US allow this. Even though more than 150 6th-grade families at 75 Morton signed a petition last year in support of allowing students to work ahead in math, the school administration refused to allow it. Their reasoning was that doing so would go against their 'mission of diversity and inclusion.' It is unclear to me how denying a student an opportunity to excel makes a school less diverse. As a result, students who are strong in math sit in classrooms at Morton not learning anything, and the school administration, plus some Morton parents, think there is nothing wrong with this.\n\n\nHowever, as I stated elsewhere, 'pedagogy' is not the only problem with Morton. The following response from last year's quality survey sums it up: 37% of students say that most students at their school treat each other with respect. (Q1d) - It's very hard to find a middle school in District 2 where this percentage was worse, (i.e., only City Knoll is lower.) The classroom behavior results on this survey were also not positive, and were unfavorable compared to both the district and city averages. This isn't because Morton is a new school with growing pains. It is because the students at this school all realize that they will not have to face any consequences for disruptive behavior."", ""Mr Chachere thank you for being brave and outspoken to share this with their parents. Whether parents agree with this method or not, it's the model for schools under Carranza's dictatorship. It's easier to bring advanced students down than it is to bring under performing ones up.

The show came in on-budget: the 28k plus the additional fundraising. The box office and concession income outperformed the projected income for the show and reportedly covered the entirety of the PTA\'s budgeted pledge. So while this PTA did budget quite a lot of money to the Mainstage production, the income offsets the investment. This year\'s production had a cast of 40 students representing a significant percentage of our school\'s small size. The production is open to all high schoolers. The Principal has reportedly expressed his conviction that a musical is the art form that allows our students from all majors to compete for roles. Competition is fierce to be cast, and true ""triple threats"" are most likely to win coveted roles. Workshops were offered to all students to prepare them for auditions.', ""That sounds fair. LaGuardia puts a lot of money into their annual musical too and they don't even have as many performance opportunities for students as PPAS."", 'LaGuardia also focuses on other majors in their school. Plus LaGuardia has a rigorous academic requirement.., that is buried at PPAS', ""You miss the point. PPAS has more performance opportunities for students throughout the year than LaGuardia and, like LaGuardia, the bulk of the school's fundraising goes to a single major yearly production- a musical. Did PPAS ever claim to be academically rigorous? That's not why students want to go there. They want to meet and fulfill the requirements of high school with the possibly for oporutnities made available to the academically ambitious. Sounds like you have some sour grapes, GF (aka Bboys64, u parent, etc.,)"", ""This is not entirely accurate and sugar coats the events of the year. \n\n At the beginning of the school year the principal announced doe budget cuts which resulted in cancelling some classes with the arts partners with the hope that doe funding would be restored perhaps in January.   Yet in February due to the mainstage production which casts 90% musical theater kids, the principal assumed many line items from the PTA budget to insure the main stage was not jeopardized.  His view being that's what attracts families to the school. The so called workshops to help kids prepare for auditions was a ruse and in theory all kids had the opportunity to be cast. In fact, the workshops were poorly attended largely due to lack of notice and the perception that kids would not be cast unless they were musical theater. Further, one might suggest that if a fundraiser was run it would benefit the entire school, not 40 kids and it would make sense that monies would go to support the budget items that the school was taking over from the PTA budget. If the school suddenly has funds, why wouldn't classes be added back that were removed earlier in the year? None of it makes any sense. \n\nI am friendly with the embattled president and treasurer, both have verbally attacked and defamed viciously in their efforts at trying to follow rules and in trying to straighten out the mess they were handed. They have tried to get some focus on academics, yet are dismissed on every front.  College placement is interesting, some of the schools include PACE, SUNY Pottsdam, LIU, SUNY Erie, SUNY Purchase, Point Park University, Manhattan College, Rutgers, Montclair, and Delaware State. \n\n> \n\n> WAMD has it right. If your child isn't musical theater, seek an alternative. If you care about academics, seek an alternative."", ""You should know that the same thing happens at almost ALL performing arts schools. LaGuardia spends the bulk of their PTA funds on one major production - a musical. It's a musical because it gives the opportunity to feature performances in voice, dance, and drama/comedy work. PPAS is not doing anything unusual here. Auditions are open to all students, but kids who study musical theater will have an edge in auditions by nature of their interest in musical theater.  You're making a mountain out of a molehill. Also, it seems to me that there are a lot of schools that focus on academics with a side of arts. LaGuardia is being criticized for hammering down on academics harder than they need (both in admissions and demanding AP classes for most kids). There are so many NYC kids who would rather focus deeply on the arts and deal with what they must academically. What is the precise problem with academics? Is it the lack of AP offerings? Is it the teacher quality? Why not just let PPAS be what LaGuardia used to be - a place where students get to focus on their passions while the school gives them what they need to graduate. If some kids want more than what they school offers, PPAS has ways to accommodate those students through college classes."", '', ""Well, GF. Some of that ambition must be left to the students themselves. This is a school with a major focus on performing arts with students who choose to be there because they want to prioritize performing arts. I don't think anyone has ever been deceived that performing arts schools did anything differently.  Look what's happening at LaGuardia with a principal that has shifted the focus of that performing arts school to academics. If you didn't want performing arts for your child, perhaps you shouldn't have enrolled."", ""What is wrong with having both?  Bright, employable 'arts' people?  Awesome!!!  Right?"", ""What's wrong with your child taking initiative? Or is that the school's fault? And employable how? Do you think that PPAS should focus on STEM? Good luck with that."", 'You are trashing academics?', ""No. I'm trashing the idea that a school with a focus on performing arts should ask that ALL the kids be equally devoted to academic pursuits beyond the basics. PPAS offers opportunities for students who want more than the basics, so I'm not sure what your problem is."", 'Like any reputable High School.., should focus on the broad spectrum of the students needs.  Not focus on one aspect of the performing arts.  They have the responsibility to teach stronger academics as these students will be going off into a much more competitive world.  \nThis is not just about MT.  They should not receive all of the funding.\nThe PA, in the past, has raised money specifically for academic programs for kids.., so they could afford to take the initiative if they so chose.  That money was moved from place to place and never allocated to the specifics of what it was raised for.', ""It really sounds like PPAS was the wrong high school for you because most of the parents are fine with the balance. If students want stronger academics, they can put the time in and get that, but it sounds like you really didn't want a performing arts school for your kid."", 'Most of the parents are not fine with the balance.  Most of the parents do not know how to voice their opinions.., or who to voice their opinions to.', 'I find that hard to believe. More likely is that people were yes- sing you to your face.

02M413,"[""From a juniors perspective, what makes SOF stand out is our exhibitions. A teacher, whom I highly respect, has admitted that exhibitions are the best preparation for college that any student can go through, and I agree. The exhibitions push our creativity by letting us chose our own topic, yet also push some students out of their comfort zone since we have to present our findings to a panel at the very end of the process. \nIn comparison to regents, I think exhibitions are not only beneficial for our communication skills, but also our problem solving and research skills, qualities that regent tests simply cannot offer. Since we do exhibitions instead of regents, it also allows our curriculum to be more liberating, and not groomed to ace a test. For instance, in physics class (usually taken in 11th grade) we not only learn about physics material but also the stereotypes and injustices that are observed in the science field, such as medical racism and gender inequality.\nIn addition, although some comments are saying that our teachers may not always be the best, the majority are outstanding and regardless of the teacher's teaching style, you're bound to learn something in each class. \nHowever, the one thing I can never get used to at SOF are the stairs!\nHonestly, a general high school school tip, regardless of the school, is to always put in effort, or else you might not get a lot in return."", 'can anybody speak to the academic rigor of this school?', 'Current junior here.

It is such a pleasure to see my child be happy socially and academically.  The homework is kind of heavy but kid doing fine.  The teachers always answer my emails and the PTA is very committed to improving the school.  \nComing from a private school that doesn't encourage individuality, have to say SOF is a god send.  I invested a lot of time checking out this school before allowing my child to apply and it paid off.  I know the school isn't perfect, never is but best thing I ever did was allow my child to be a student here.  My child is studying mandarin and doing very well -- loves the teacher!

Ridiculous considering it is supposed to be a 25-page college-level thesis paper. Making friends can be a challenge. A lot of middle school students end up staying and already know each other. Either you find a group to hang with or you're an outcast. The transition from 10th to 11th is ROUGH. Please be prepared, especially if you or your child partakes in a number of after-school activities. DO NOT TAKE MANDARIN.

That teacher told the principal on me and I explained that it wasn’t me and I had no idea what he was talking about. So I went up to this website to find the review and when reading it, I know it obviously wasn’t me. The principal didn’t believe me (I just had this feeling he didn’t believe my words..).

The teachers and staff are so dedicated and get to know every student. This is a good, small, innovative,  hidden secret of a school.', ""I want to sing the praises of Quest to Learn. My family is at the end of a long road. We have been at Quest since the very beginning. My oldest son, now a college sophomore, entered as part of Quest's first sixth grade class in 2009. My younger son entered the school two years later and is now an upper school senior, already accepted to the college of his choice. Throughout these last years, Quest has been brilliant. Granted, not without its stumbles, but in the end, each time, strength has won out. My older boy had an IEP when he came to the school. He was so shy, felt so other, he could not even look teachers or peers in the eye. Every year we got calls from his pre-school and then his elementary school, there's something wrong with your son. He was the one who first became aware of this new school and its unusual education premise. Under the guidance of the remarkable teachers and the school's innovative educational paradigm, we saw a complete turnaround in his sheer enthusiasm for the classroom, and even more important his understanding of himself. In the end he graduated valedictorian, and he went to college with the most valuable of lifetime gifts: he had been taught to problem solve, think, and reason. This is the mandate of Quest to Learn, what sets it apart. There may be schools more rigorous, more bent to test taking and SATs. If you want your kid to be a calculous whiz, maybe Quest is not your first place (although math and science are super strong here). But if you want a child free of the pressure cooker mentality, strong in self-confidence, able to work seamlessly with others, and a tenacious self-learner, Quest is the place. The staff is nothing short of miraculous. Starting with the principal, Nick Jurman, the fantastic, enthusiastic, unbridled faculty, and the school's effervescent, dynamo, parent coordinator, Kathy Ringrose, Quest to Learn is an oasis in an often confounding New York City public school quagmire. This is a place a child can be him or herself, without qualm, without fear. If looking for a high school of superb heart and promise, Quest to Learn may be the very solution. My highest recommendation."", 'The recent parent teacher conferences for high school were a reminder, that in addition to the innovative ""systems thinking approach"" to education at Q2L, the real gem of the school is the teachers.

Once something like this is experienced, it is lifelong indelible.  Reflect for a moment on a teacher that made a difference in your life.  At Quest, my son has a collection of teachers and staff (including the principal) that have been meaningful to him.  We are very pleased with what Quest has provided for our son and are grateful to the dedicated leadership, staff and teachers that have valued and supported him and inspiried his intellectual growth.

He is now one of the leaders in his class.  Loves to participate and basically really likes (if not loves) school.  Now maybe this would have happened at any school but I will never know.

It is a pleasure to watch students of all levels and backgrounds grapple with sophisticated ideas and learn how to think systematically through the work of thinkers I never encountered until college. I'm excited to work with one of my co-teachers this year to launch the Quest to Learn Writing Center, an after school program which will enlist our strongest student-writers to help peers and underclassmen plan, revise, edit, and proofread papers. My biggest hope since the Upper School's inception has been to empower students to take real ownership of the school community and pass on leadership roles to one another as they leave. I see this happening more and more every year. When I imagine the soul-crushing, cutthroat competition some of our higher level students might face in more homogenous, segregated schools, I think that they are lucky to get to focus on their thinking and on communicating with students of all levels here at Quest.

The Institute of Play is now back and in full force.  Mr Jurman is fair, but strict and students respect the boundaries he's put in place.  He's hired and retained top notch teachers that are some of the best I've seen in the city.  The cirriculum is rigorous, but extremely interesting to students.  It's the best kept secret in NYC.  My advice is to get in while you can, because I suspect soon it will not be so easy to gain entrance."", 'Q2L - the right fit?  My son is a junior and he started at Q2L in the 6th grade.  It was by his motivation that we considered the school and by his committment that it was put on his list as his first choice.  For us, it was the perfect fit.   We\'ve experienced the school growing from a fledgling middle school into a fully staffed high school and recognize, as well as, respect the challenges that growth of any institution presents.  Particularly one that is an innovative concept living within the DOE system.  Looking back on this journey, we are very grateful to be part of this school.  Especially now, as we look for colleges and see the value of ""his story and his academic journey"" as a component of the college application process.  Through every step of the way with Quest, my son has had the opportunity to practice solution based thinking.  He has been fortunate to have had the type of teachers that create lifetime memories due to their impact on your day/week/year.  The teaching staff at Quest believe in the art and craft of inspired instruction and the support of the new Administration has brought the opportunities for instructional greatness to a higher level. Despite the bumps in the road, I can only see great things in Quest\'s future.', ""This school was 5th on my son's list but it was where he was assigned despite great grades and scores. He was a bit apprehensive at first but very soon decided it is ' the best school ever' He finds it challenging and interesting. He loves the curriculum. I have never seen him so excited about homework as about the assignments he has been given in this school. His teachers are lovely and approachable and there is an all round feeling of collaboration between the administration, teachers, parents and students. The only downside is the building. It is old and outdated and does not have the modern ammeneties you would expect from such a progressive school. However, I believe the teachers lead the students in a 'make the best of what we've got' attitude which will serve them well throughout their lives.

What happened with the previous principal and if the new one has any specific plans to turn the place around? I want to give it a chance because of the overall idea this high school wants to put into use and it seemed really fun. "", 'Give this school a chance- I heard great things about the new principal- I am going there myself and I thing this school is going to turn around.', 'Now that my son\'s nearly done with 8th grade, I suppose it\'s time for an update. Let me start by saying my son has an IEP and is not a great student OR an easy kid to deal with. During his first two years at Quest he had a handful of talented teachers who knew how to deal with parents and Special Ed kids ... sadly they are either gone, or in the High School. The Parent Coordinator here is a super-star and IMHO, the glue holding the last shreds of this failing institution together. The after-school program (Manhattan Youth) is very weak to say the least and the guidance staff is highly competent, but severely over-worked. My son fits in well here at Quest, he\'s definitely found his place socially, but has his education be stellar..not so much. Has my experience as a parent been positive... again, not usually.\n         With a staggering 30% special ed population, this school should have a far more talented, better trained and innovative special ed staff. I am a middle school teacher and I get it...Middle School is a battlefield especially with a ""quirky"" mostly non-academic population like most Quest kids, but that being the case,  the curriculum and overall instruction should be FAR more innovative as originally promised. Seeing that the school never really bothered to offer test-prep, (even when it was specifically promised) certainly they didn\'t give much of a damn about state tests, so why not provide the groundbreaking technology-driven gaming methodology we were promised? \n     There were glimmers of hope... mostly in 6th grade, but the promise never really materialized and by the time 8th grade rolled around my kid was bored,angry and discouraged. Alex ended up in a school for ""tech kids"" with NO technology in his curriculum AT ALL... instead, 8th grade parents were force-fed an advanced Spanish curriculum that most of us neither wanted or needed. School Elections and student celebrations almost disappeared by 8th grade as well. An 8th grade trip promised since orientation never transpired...lots of missed opportunities and broken promises here. The initial parent computer portal was switched at some point and the new one was never fully adopted by the faculty, or explained to the parents, (That training would have been useful for the PTA to provide!) essentially cutting off our primary access to day-to-day information and creating a lot of frustration for kids and adults.\n       Academic rigor was never really present, with follow-through and consistency lacking pretty much across-the-board in the classroom and via administration. Little homework, lots of work-sheets and endlessly repeated content (How many times do kids need to ""study"" bullying, or  the civil rights movement?). The one traditional strategy the kids really DID need was not taught... a solid writing essay writing format they can use in all of their subjects (some use the acronym  RACE).  This is avery effective tool for struggling writers and standardized test-taking. \n           One bright-spot, is the twice-annual Boss Level projects. These give a glimpse of how the Q2L school concept was initially envisioned. If I were running the show, I would have Boss Levels three times per year, adding the week before Spring Break as the  perfect time to unwind after all of the State Exams to engage in nontraditional group work.\n           So the BIG question is why has this noble experiment failed?   First of all, this is a non-screened school, so unlike many District 2 Middle Schools, it becomes a a dumping ground for special ed kids and discipline problems. The only way that can change is if the school  A.) becomes screened  (highly unlikely) OR  B) they become MUCH better and dealing with discipline. \n         Next, much has been said about the principal and while Im not a huge fan, I don\'t think she is inept or evil, but mostly overworked. I honestly don\'t know how the DOE expects one set of administrators to run an already struggling middle school AND start-up a high school at the same time! I don\'t know why the IOP disappeared , or if they\'re returning, but I\'m sure their exit didn\'t help matter much. \n          Third and most importantly...a flawed curriculum. I was engaged in conversations with the administration about my grave concerns about Quests ""fluffy"" (IOP mandated ) curriculum early-on in 6th grade.  My biggest issue being way way way too much ""wellness"", a course clearly envisioned for low-income/ inner-city kids ...maybe not the best fit for the typical D2 demographic. My child really doesn\'t need 1-2 periods a week of nutrition or bullying education when he could be taking art, music, or hmm I dunno maybe technology !!!!!  This combined with random study-halls (who has Study Halls these days..NO ONE!) and Home Base ...yet more BS, there seemed to be MANY MANY wasted hours in the school week.  \n    Looking at Q2L\'S High School retention statistics it is clear that Quest is not making it as a traditional school OR as a progressive school, so ground-up changes are greatly needed. Perhaps the future Quest needs to be a portfolio school like ICE? The powers-that-be need to take a long,  hard look at the curriculum and the demographic is serves.\n      It\'s a shame Alex couldn\'t stay at Quest for High School, because that was our plan...but how could he with all that we\'ve seen? We went to the Quest High School open house and it all sounded great...a film and video curriculum in cooperation with NYU but as they say... ""Fool me once ...shame on you. Fool me twice...shame on me!""  Hasta la vista Q2L and best of luck to all involved!', ""I agree with QuestFan:  this is a great school for a certain kind of \nstudent, quirky, smart, interested in other than the regular curriculum.\n  My son has done extremely well here in Middle School.  I've talked to \nmany 6th grade parents who are thrilled with the school and the way \ntheir children have fit in.

We did not get all we wanted from the NYC DOE, but I am satisfied and looking forward to a better future in my child\'s last school years. Now my son  is going to have ""fresh start"" in a different school next week. It was a hard battle and I endured a lot of stress and my health significantly deteriorated. My son suffered the worse - the hospitalization as the result of a retaliation game played against our family by some ill-spirited, off-agenda officials at Q2L in response to my justified and long ignored complaints to the NYC DOE. My son\'s future is the most important issue in all of this and it has been the ultimate goal for me. I did everything possible to provide him with an acceptable educational environment in a very limited choice of relatively good schools our city politicians can offer to NYC kids. \n\nI would like to thank my fantastic friends and my son\'s wonderful doctors who helped enormously to resolve this situation in the best interest of my child. I also deeply appreciate the gracious help of U.S. Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, the Compliance Team Attorneys at US DOE Office for Civil Rights and other U.S. and NYS officials who found time and willingness to bring to a peace-filled end to the viciously active 2-year long circle of violation of my child\'s rights; my parental rights; along with a cruel war of retaliation and outright discrimination organized against a small family of the single dad and his child by Q2L principal and some of her obedient and shamefully misguided supporters.  \n\nI also would like to thank Q2L\'s parent\'s coordinator and my son\'s school guidance counselor for their kindness, professionalism and support during a very difficult turmoil our family endured in the last few weeks  of intense battles against illegal actions by the Q2L principal and the unlawful inaction of NYC DOE.  \n\nGovernor Cuomo received my statements along with all the complaints to NYC DOE that was been ignored for the last two years on Tuesday of last week while my son was still in a hospital clinic and was under observation and with no school to return to, because to return to Q2L was impossible considering he was being targeted by some staff members. The same day, the Governor\'s administration contacted NYC DOE and finally a process started to move in a positive direction. I am very thankful. My son is grateful and our family unit is content with the resolution.\n\nI wish Quest to Learn a successful future. In my view, the school has mostly wonderful teachers. My hopes that Q2L administration change its course and instead of punishing a parent and his child for criticism on this forum and in the form of justified complaints in search for resolution from upper level of government, for any family desire to implement their student and parental rights would look for communication and compromise to avoid such tragedies that my family was forced to experience this school year.\n\n01-19-2016 \n\nDear HK mom,\n\nThis morning I discovered that Insideschools.org deleted my appeal to parent\'s community in this page seeking help from other parents in order to help my child who is at one of NYC hospitals now because he is a victim of unlawful actions by Q2l principal along with her accomplice and illegal inaction by all levels of NYC DOE management, including High Schools Superintendent Donald Coyners himself.\n\nNYC DOE for over two month refused (finally talks started yesterday at NYC DOE main office on Chambers street thanks to intervention of NYS government) to grant transfer my son from the toxic environment at Q2L to a different school disregarding my son’s doctors’ requests, systematic violation of ESL mandates, wicked acts of retaliation by Q2L school principal and some of her staff, safety concerns, etc.\n\nI can’t disclose to the public the reasons for my son’s hospitalization due to child’s privacy concerns, but it is a result of a cruel act of retaliation by a recently hired school official, who tried to destroy our family life.\n\nIn order to transfer my son I needed reasons, besides a doctor’s medical advice. I have a number of issues with Q2L school that the NYC DOE has ignored for two years in a row, and until yesterday was punishing me and my son for filing a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at U.S. Department of Education along with other actions in order to protect my child\'s rights.\n\nAs a general matter the First Amendment prohibits discrimination based on the content or viewpoint of an individual’s speech. For example, prohibiting citizens from criticizing school officials would be impermissible because it would be a discrimination on the basis of content, allowing praise of government officials but not allowing criticism. \n\nIn other words, the First Amendment, above all else, rejects actions that favor some ideas or viewpoints while excluding others.\n\nThe First Amendment comes into play when (like in this situation) a parent faces retaliation because of his or her criticism.\n\nAs Supreme Court Justice Brennan once stated: “The constitutionally protected right to speak out on governmental affairs would be meaningless if it did not extend to statements expressing criticism of governmental officials”. \n\nNevertheless, it is possible that a short-lived posting of appeal seeking help from other parents that was undemocratically deleted also played its role in breaking this unlawful and vicious pattern of stonewalling my appeals to NYC DOE. My son should be out of hospital very soon and must go back to a different school after what happened at Q2L. \n\n...Perhaps New York is really two cities rather than one. There is one small city populated by the rich and fortunate, who manage to send their children to the best public and private schools available. Then there is the larger city of the unfortunate and deprived of their basic rights, whose children are routinely assigned to failing schools and locked up there like my child, frozen into a life of low expectations and meager opportunity.\n\nThe widespread sense of resignation serves as a cynical excuse for a system that lacks the political will and the professional know-how to provide a decent education for all, or even most, children in the city…\n\nInstead of censoring courteous criticism and periodically closing this page for comments from the parents, Insideschool.org should complete fixing the description of Q2L, for example, stop mentioning pulled out Institute of Play and quoting former principal Aliza Aragon as if she was still the principal (and whom I and other parents miss greatly).', ""My child is STILL in this school, unfortunately.

Jen Rygalski killed the\ndiscussion with her usual empty excuses, this  time citing privacy concerns and  having not enough information from other schools in the buildings since she  doesn\'t have good relationships with the other principals, as she stated, etc. In my view, she didn\'t even show care or concern about the episode to make parents comfortable. \nI have to say, she has good command of English, and she is very clever with the policy of deceiving parents by giving them empty promises such as: ""I’m going to look into revisiting this issue"", “I will give you response later,” etc.  This terms  she often uses regarding  most problems the school has during these toothless PTA meetings and beyond. For second year now, she been killing ideas such as providing Q2L kids the ability to use the pool in the building, or getting teachers on-board for some important subjects that are missing at Q2L.. Unfortunately, present PTA leadership believes that their agenda only relates to fundraising and as result my appeals to PTA leadership for help with Jen Rygalski\'s refusal to follow clear laws and regulations concerning my child education have all been ignored.\n', 'I agree with you.', 'Regarding use of the pool, from what I know about other schools in other buildings that have had similar issues, the problem is this:  For a school in a shared building to use the pool, that school must have its own gym teacher who is certified to teach swimming.  If a school does not have such a certified teacher, its students may not use the pool in the building.  Please note that when the majority of the DOE buildings with pools were built, there was only ONE school in the entire building.  Thus, finding the funding for one gym teacher among many, with the certification, was not difficult.  Fast forward to today, with several small schools sharing a building.  Each small school has to either provide its own swim teacher (and librarian, art teacher, music teacher, etc.) or agree to share a position (not so easy if a building has charters as well as public schools).   Some of your concerns about Quest seem to stem from this funding issue.  It is not something that most principals or PTAs are able to overcome; unfortunately, I would note that this is also a problem regarding science labs, as with the breaking up of campuses into multiple schools, some schools now lack access to a vented lab,  which is necessary for teaching Regents science classes.  Your best bet may be to have your school try to reach out to the other schools in the building, to see whether it is possible to share a swim instructor.', 'In the PTA metting a few weeks ago one of the parents, who is licensed life guard,  offered his service for free, but I guess that idea was quickly killed by the principal.

I raised these issues with school administration since last school year and after been ignored  I appealed to deferent levels of government.  I asked, repeatedly,  for special classes or mandatory seminars for all the students at Q2L, where they can be taught how wrong it is to act in such abusive manner and to have such derogatory views on deferent social groups of our society. This school should at least tell kids that this kind of behavior and views are amoral and  against the federal and state laws. Unfortunately, my appeals to NYC DOE and to local council members brought no results. Not as much as even a written  response. I guess this school runs as a bastion of ignorance and lawlessness.\nNYC government has no way to interfere, or just doesn\'t want to bother, that is why the parents need to place pressure at this forum  and  where it also needed to change this appalling situation at Q2L.\n\nOnce again I want to bring up conclusion below, since I presume it is  the explanation for such negative phenomenon NYC children and their parents have to suffer from:\n"".. Academic failure in New York City is widespread and accepted. It is the norm rather than the exception. Perhaps one reason that politicians, policy makers, and opinion leaders find failure in the system so tolerable is that hardly any of them have children in schools that appear or belong on the SURR (Schools Under Registration Review) list, and, in fact, only a small minority even have children who attend public schools. Perhaps New York is really two cities rather than one. There is one small city populated by the fortunate, who manage to send their children to the best public and private schools available. Then there is the larger city of the unfortunate whose children are routinely assigned to failing schools, frozen into a life of low expectations and meager opportunity.\nThere is a hushed assumption among many of those who live in the first city that those in the second are doing as well as might be expected. The implicit suggestion is that the causes of failure can be traced to the student or the family rather than the school or the system. Such resignation to failure falls lame in the face of the many academically successful public and non-public schools that thrive in the midst of poverty and social deprivation along side many failing institutions. The widespread sense of resignation serves as a cynical excuse for a system that lacks the political will and the professional know-how to provide a decent education for all, or even most, children in the city…"" \n', 'Your incendiary screed identifies you, your anger and hate speech for what it is.

Most parents I know never, ever go to this site after they get their child into a middle or HS. in fact, when I have looked at comments for various schools, usually what I see for a lot of schools, only the negative feelings about a school. As I read the many comments here, I understand some of what is said but disagree with much. My child (has IEP) goes to Quest HS, he has been there since 6th grade. We truly loved the middle school, he thrived and finally learned to like math and science, which he was so turned off to in elementary school (he went to one of the most sought after schools). His 9th grade in HS was fine but the last 2 years have not been so great overall. We tried to get him into an alternative school last year but he has perfect attendance, all his credits, passed his regents and he is a good kid, (just not a great student) because of all his positive school results, he was not a candidate). \nI have to disagree with this parent on several facts. To say that the school is not safe is painting a false picture. My son has never had trouble and he is a shy kid, not tough at all. I am deeply offended when someone say\'s this is a ""ghetto"" school. Do you even know the kids that go to Quest? I am not even sure what you mean when  you say Ghetto, I can only imagine what you mean, and it doesn\'t strengthen your posting. \nWhat I don\'t like about the HS, it is concentrating on regents exams, everything has to be taught with this in mind. My kid stayed at Quest because most of the other schools all concentrated on this and he had hoped for something different at Quest HS. This is the one thing I truly wish and hope, that they change. If they can become more like Beacon and the other 26 schools that do not have to do regents, they can go back to their original idea of how this school was intended. It will not benefit my son but my hope is for the future kids looking for something different. \n\nSure, there are some teachers that are not great but my son has had some wonderful teachers, this year, last year and the middle school teachers were mostly all fantastic. True that many left last year and it disturbed me that they did (however, some of these teachers, I was happy to see go) there still remains terrific teachers. They have  been extremely responsive to my emails, request for meetings and helping my child. \n\nTo say that kids who stay at the school after middle school are the ones who don\'t get in anywhere else, that\'s just not true. My son and his friends, all decent, some straight A students, choose to stay at Quest, putting it down as their first choice. I would like to know where you get the 99% wanted to leave, as fact? Did you get those quotes from the DOE? I highly doubt it. So express your dissatisfaction with real arguments, not stating things as fact when you don\'t know. If you want to inform a parent, state the facts of ""your experience"", in detail. Not just general. these statements could be about any school and doesn\'t give a parent information that they can use. \n\nAs for the comment about those responding  on this site as staff, I know some of the people who have responded here and they are definitely parents. \nI can understand your frustration,  the last 2 years were not as good as prior years for my kid but to state things in your comments as fact is just not fair. \nYou are obviously angry and dissatisfied but I am not clear on why? It\'s too general. I do wish the best for your child and for you. it is not easy when school is so troublesome for a kid. In NYC, we are lucky to have a choice. Where I grew up, we went to the HS in our neighborhood, good teachers, bad teachers.....   I know you probably will not believe this but Quest had students returning from HS (they left after middle), one from Stuyvesant. Yes, Several of my son\'s classmates from Quest middle got into Stuyvesant.\n\nAs we move forward, The principal has been replaced and I can only hope that this gentleman will be more supportive of his teachers, open to parents, ready to make Quest the innovative and fantastic school that it set out to be. Let\'s hope because many NYC kids need an innovative and engaging school.\n\nFinally, one of my best friends asked me last year about Quest, as \ntheir child is going into 6th grade. i was very truthful to them with my\n concerns but also with positive experience as a parent for 6 years at \nQuest. They have an amazing child, good grades and excellent student. \nThey will become a new Quest Family and I am happy for them. My hope is that by the time their child gets to 8th grade, the HS will be much \nstronger and inline with their original idea. \n\n(Note: regarding the stabbing, a school security guard cannot disclose this information. A school also has legal obligations and can only say so much. Asking for a school or anyone at a school to give you more information than they are allowed legally is asking for lawsuits. If you want that to change, you have to go to your politicians to change laws. Don\'t get down on a school or their administration. BTW: the incident was another school, not a Quest student.']"

In my son's year, there are far more boys.  They are looking for natural ability, not training (which girls tend to have much more of, BT wants to train in their way). Half the 5th graders (mix of girls and boys) are invited to stay for the middle school, based on ability and attitude. Then for HS, again only half are invited to stay with PPAS as academics. It is competitive for sure but the kids do not seem to look at it like that. The ballet program is exceptional and academics just as good, especially ELA and Math.  Small classes, 20-22 kids, make a difference too.  It has been an incredible experience form my son.

As I have another school to compare the response against, I can tell you, Ms. Douglas and her staff are shining.', 'It is true that Mr. McGuire has left the school to become an Assistant Superintendent at District 15. Shanna Douglas has taken over the position.  Ms. Douglas has been with LMC for 8 years, first as an ELA teacher and teacher leader, then as Assistant Principal for the last 2 years.

I am confident that the strong sense of community which LMC is known for will continue on under her direction. --Hope Flamm, LMC PTA Co-President', 'Thank you for your clear, concise response. i have heard this from other parents from LMC as well.', ""LMC is a really nurturing community school.  Our child attended a GandT elementary school and chose LMC as his top choice middle school based on school tours and is now thriving emotionally, intellectually and socially at LMC.  The homework is about 30 minutes a night and I'm no longer involved with it. The teachers are caring and engaged, the sensible midwestern principal fosters a sense of compassion, intellectual curiosity and community, and the arts and science programs are excellent. All the teachers have been great, in fact.  An excellent Spanish teacher too and extremely caring advisors. The PTA is dedicated and kind. Each class has students of different abilities and the more advanced students help the others in a non competitive environment.  I leave happy and grateful every time I visit there and my child is so much more excited about middle school than elementary with a more developed confidence and sense of self.   The only challenge is that some kids are occasionally disruptive in class and less interested in learning which happens in middle school and can be annoying but that is part of life to navigate as well.  Students of different abilities can do well here, and a loving, compassionate environment benefits everyone."", 'I have to agree.  I now have an 8th grader there.

In 6th grade we didn't really do much and when we got to 7th & 8th grade they dumped all this work on us which was irritating. They should do a better job on easing the students into things. In 7th grade most students including myself liked to focus on our grades since we knew this is the grade that high schools would look at, but it was still fun and we learned a lot. 8th grade was also definitely fun but at the same time very time consuming. Nevertheless being in 8th grade gave us certain privileges no other grade got and allowed me to have great memories. I will miss this school and its community days, IR periods, out lunch privileges, technology, Arts explosions, elevators, and most importantly giving me the gateway to get in to very good high school (7th ranked in NYC). I 100% recommend this school :)"", 'I agree whole heartedly with the poster below...this school is amazing. My daughter is finishing up 8th grade and she had a wonderful experience all three years. The academics are excellent and the sense of community and bonds between teachers and students are wonderful. Kids from all different walks of life thrive at LMC. My daughters state test scores improved during her years here and she just got in to an excellent high school. Students from this school are getting into a wide array of really good schools in District 2 as well as specialized high schools and LaGuardia.

The middle school years can be hard for kids but my daughter has had a really positive experience and much credit is due to LMC for that.', ""This school is amazing.  My now 7th grader actually loves school and the incredible staff at LMC is the major reason for this.  As I tell the principal often, he has amassed the greatest staff of educators who know how to get through to a child academically, while  also supporting them emotionally and socially-- which is huge at this age. The staff is very responsive to commubication, input and questions from parents and children, as is the principal who is VERY hands on and amazing w BOTH kids and adults.   All of the staff that I have dealt with is passionate about their jobs and their love of kids and education.   I can't envision a better place for any child/pre-teen in the city.  \n\nThe school can accommodate all types of students -- from the strongest to the weakest while making everyone feel good about themselves.

I don't know the exact curriculum but it covers everything from photography and graphic arts to sound and motion art. The PTA makes sure the classrooms are filled with upgraded technology and digital equipment each year. The teachers are fantastic, and many kids go on to arts based high schools."", ""Thanks HelgaH and InsideSchools.  My daughter has finished 6th grade at LMC.  I feel we made the right choice.  The school environment and principal are as a well oiled machine.  Kids are nurtured but not coddled, and there is a creative vibe at its core but it is also neat and organized.  It's not academically intense with a ton of homework and rote, but the kids are busy learning throughout the day.  The teachers are so enthusiastic, I smile just remembering the ones DD had last school year.  Students have opportunities to explore and discover who they might become in leadership positions, social activism, teams, afterschool extracurriculars (which is *free*, run by Manhattan Youth). This school has a feel of Yin Yang in harmony.  It also helps that the current PTA President (Nikki) is amazing and at every event."", ""An update.  I am disappointed with afterschool this year... yeah, I know it's free, and also there was an abrupt change in site director, but the choices in visual art after school classes were very lacking. My daughter now just hangs out with friends after school.  Also, I noticed the school does not have clubs, either during school or after school."", ""I agree that the reviews of this school are very out of date. This school is amazing. I don't think I realized how much so until we were halfway into our daughter's first year. We also felt somewhat apprehensive about the test scores which was a mistake. The best thing this school does, other than accept all levels of learners, is that they support each student for the individual they are, encouraging them to use their unique gifts to contribute. The effects on self esteem and confidence are measurable. The school manages to support both the higher and lower performing students. Many go on to specialized high schools. \n\nI would respectfully disagree with the 6th grade parent about the tiers they set below. LMC placed in the citywide math competition, not once but seve\nral times. \n\nI love how much we were invited into the school to observe the arts celebrations and academic projects. The arts curriculum is phenomenal. My daughter took responsibility from day one for her homework and has shown more independence that we ever imagined. She is so much happier here than she was in her elementary school. \n\nThe teachers are incredibly passionate and one can easily tell that they really want to be there. Something has gone incredibly right here, and I feel confident that Kelly McGuire is behind a lot of it. A more qualified, fair, kind, sane, intelligent, intuitive and compassionate principal would be hard to find."", ""It seems that Inside Schools needs to update its review, as much of the commentary is out of date (from 2010) and no longer relevant. LMC is a wonderful, diverse, nurturing school. LMC attracts all kinds of students from the high performing to those needing support. Test scores are average for the district because all kinds of learners are accepted, not just those who go in testing well. If you're looking for a progressive school with an emphasis on encouraging students to be self-motivated learners, this is your school. If your child is interested in art, music, and dance, LMC may be right for you.

It really was a factor for us. Will think about the school again come high school now :)"", ""I have to say I wouldn't put SOF, Quest and LMC below 289 and Baruch SP. I have kids who went to both. If what you need is to be among people who are exactly on your child's level then perhaps. But it would be a mistake to make the assumption that academically they have advantages. LMC's highest performing students are very well equipped for specialized high schools.

The academic offerings are exceptional: most students take Algebra I and Earth Science (both HS level courses), students have a choice of 4 languages, and arts and technology electives are superb.

A really amazing 3 years."", 'Where is your daughter going to HS?', 'Just wanted to offer more commentary that is recent. Our child is currently in 8th grade and the school has been very good so far. It\'s fairly traditional, yes. You\'re not going to find a ton of progressive learning activities or really out-of-the-box thinking in terms of curriculum and instruction, but that hasn\'t been a negative thing. There have been times that I\'ve wished the teacher chose different books or a more contemporary way of looking at, and engaging in, an issue or topic, but it hasn\'t been harmful. Our child hasn\'t found the curriculum to be particularly challenging - certainly not to the level we had anticipated when we first heard about the school and worried if it would be too much. The math and science teachers have been exceptional and really engaged our child in a way we never imagined! But we\'ve been less than impressed with humanities thus far, in fact, have been pretty disappointed. The process of teaching the kids to write a research paper was underwhelming and poorly managed, I don\'t think our child learned a thing and it was a missed opportunity that took up a lot of (wasted) time. On the flipside, the school does an excellent job of scaffolding learning and responsibility through the science project. In 6th grade, they were really guided along with a lot of hand holding and support. In 7th grade, it was less so, and I can imagine in 8th grade it will be a far more independent process. It has been really interesting to see that in action. I think the principal even talks about that explicitly during the open houses and first day of school. It was really helpful to our child. I think they do a good job of preparing the kids for high school. In terms of socialization and school culture, our child hasn\'t complained about bullying, cliques (although we see they exist, which is normal), or other social issues. (As a frame of reference, our child isn\'t part of a popular clique and tends to be more independent around socialization, so if you have a kid who\'s not with the ""in"" crowd, know that at least for us, it hasn\'t been an issue, although I\'m sure many other families might say their kid experienced bullying.) That said, there is definitely a very popular clique at the school! But that\'s middle school everywhere, I imagine. Teachers have been responsive to any emails, for the most part, and the school does a good job of having meetings and info sessions for parents around key things like state testing, high school admissions, safety, etc. And the principal ALWAYS starts meetings on time, which we greatly appreciate. So overall, it\'s been a good experience. Great? Maybe not. But absolutely solid. I think our child feels really prepared and ready for high school.', 'Also - in response to some of the other posts, my daughter never experienced or saw any bullying or violence. The girls were however quite tough on each other - probably due to the quite stress these high acheiving, anxious kids live with . For my daughter the tension was because many of the class had come from the same elementary school and old allegiences and grievences were carried through. They all dealt with it though.  I do remember there was an incident with a student with a knife but it was quickly dealt with and wasnt serious.', 'My older daughter graduated from delta 2 years ago. She did very well (made her 2nd choice of SHS - brooklyn tech) but it was with alot of non stop effort. The children are very high acheiving and motivated - they want to go to Sty, Bronx sci etc, and push themselves and each other to acheive. The teachers are of the same mindset and really get the motivated children where they need to be.Its an exceptionally successful school if your child is the right fit for that. My second daughter went to a different middle school - WESS. Different attitude of the students, less focus on exceptional academic acheivement, and the acheivement of the students is lower. This suits my younger daughter much better than MS54 would have.

If these comments are typical for what comments can tell you about a school, they seem worthless as a source of information, to the point where I honestly wonder whether people with no connection to the school could be making things up, whether just for kicks, or perhaps even to discourage  families from applying and thereby increase their own odds of admission. I know that seems like a bizarre thing to say, but that is the level of dissonance I experience when I try to reconcile some of these criticisms with my own experience.  In any event, I feel obliged to offer my own thoughts about MS 54. \n\nMost of my son\'s teachers at MS 54 seemed to be excellent. Their teaching elicited superior work from him; more so in the humanities than in science, although this also reflects his own interests. He is also both good at and excited by math, and found math teachers with a strong command of the subject (something that unfortunately cannot be taken for granted) who managed to keep him engaged and challenged. He is a self-described nerd, and I think at most middle schools he would have been picked on; at MS 54, his peers seemed to embrace his eccentricities and passions.  \n\nMS 54 expects kids to work hard on their academics, and there is a good deal of homework. But I and other parents I know did not find the amount to be excessive, and certainly not so much as to interfere with students pursuing passions outside of school. The school also puts a lot of effort into helping students take responsibility for organizing and managing their time and workload, which was great, both in terms of helping them manage their current obligations, and in terms of preparing them for high school and beyond. Teachers are readily available before school to offer extra assistance, whether to students who are struggling, or to students who are just excited about a subject and want to dive in deeper. As for commenters who describe a super-competitive environment over grades, or one in which students are highly stressed over their test scores, that just wasn\'t our experience at all. \n\nThis coming year, the school will be eliminating the distinction between ""honors"" and ""non-honors"" tracks. It was really an obsolete distinction at a competitive-admissions school where all students are admitted on the basis of the same rubric, and where 60-70% of students are scoring at the top level on state tests, even though the school places little emphasis on test preparation. \n\nMS 54 is a large school, which has pluses and minuses. One plus is that it is big enough to support a vibrant extracurricular ecosystem with activities tailored to a variety of interests. The musical theater program is superb, managing to both put on first rate shows (there were kids involved who have performed professionally), and to embrace and welcome students with no previous performing arts experience. The model UN program holds its own at high school conferences, which they participate in because there just aren\'t many middle schools that offer this activity. \n\nRegarding safety, there was an incident one time where a student brought a knife to school; this would be easy to do, as there are no metal detectors. But this was a freak anomaly at a very large school where safety was never otherwise an issue. The knife was not used, and the school promptly learned what had happened and disciplined the student. It is true that MS 54 is not in the very safest neighborhood in Manhattan, and there were periodic incident reports about cell phone thefts and other crimes committed in the vicinity. But most kids walk to and from school every day (either from their home, or from one of the nearby subway stations), and if anything the challenge is getting them to remember that they need to stay alert to their surroundings; it certainly doesn\'t feel like a scary area.  \n\nFinally, MS 54 provides strong support to families with the NYC high school admissions process, and has a good track record of getting students into both specialized high schools and competitive-entry non-specialized high schools. The former is based just on a test (or an audition, for LaGuardia), but for the latter schools know that MS 54 graduates will be ready to hit the ground running.', 'I am the parent of a current high school freshman who is an MS 54 graduate.

Early academy 4 mornings a week before school helps whenever you need personalized attention or just want to finish an assignment. What's nice about it is that even the smartest kids go-its not like you're considered dumb or even judged at all for going to early academy. Ms54 has a HUGE library, a computer lab full of macs, and a big turf field for recess and outdoor gym classes. The social environment at MS54 is good, Sure, its a middle school so you'll get judge occasionally and there's gossip, but the school is a very welcoming community. Discipline is taken very seriously, and the school is very peaceful and students follow the rules.  There are tons of programs at MS54 besides the three main topics-8 electives and 4 languages to choose from. \n\nMS54 has been a great middle school experience for me, especially since I came from a terrible elementary school where I was only one of about 5 from my school that made honors. I am an 8th grader here. "", '', 'I stumbled across this comment when I was using this site for our HS ranking search, but feel compelled to respond to this post.  My son is a current 8th grade Honors student at this school. He read this post and does not believe a student really wrote it and I tend to agree.  This looks like a parent or teacher post. While there are limited choices in this district and he probably would have gone to this school even in hindsight, there are some things I think those in 5th grade (and parents) should know:\n\n1) Most of the teachers are very inspiring teachers at this school, but also some duds in the mix, especially in the math department.  Humanities has proven to be much stronger. Probably not too different from other MS. The teachers are accessible via email and are fairly responsive which is nice.\n2) Contrary to what this post says, there is in fact alot of homework, and even the most diligent kids we know who are not on their phones all the time will be up late (after 11pm) either studying, doing the homework or finishing longer term projects. There are very few kids I know who will say there is not a heavy workload or who didn\'t get frustrated. If your child has a sport or activity afterschool that they do consistently that gets them home later than 4pm, get ready for a cranky sleep-deprived kid as they try to finish up their schoolwork.\n3) My son has had very little minority representation in terms of African Americans in his class (maybe other minorities, but very, very few blacks).  He thinks maybe one or two a year in classes as big as 34.  He said the academic classes are much more diverse. \n4) My son says that the Honors kids do think the academic kids are not smart and they are generally viewed as the classes that are not high achievers and won\'t take regents like the rest of the school. I don\'t think you know whether your child is placed in honors or academic before the choice application is due though.  But be aware that the kids do label each other as ""academic"" or ""honors"" \n5) The kids are very focused on grades and who makes high honor role.  There is alot of pressure from the very first marking period. The school does not help matters by publicly posted the list of kids making high honor roll, and also has a ceremony at the end of every school for only those on high honor roll. (My son did make HH each term and  I don\'t ascribe to ""every kid should get a trophy""  However, I do think that the emphasis on grades in middle school is a little extreme - it\'s stressful for these kids who already have enough stress living in NYC and having to apply out to high school - so you need to know if your kid can handle this).\n6) Location is not ideal. Anything west of the school is ok, but never have your kid walk east which isn\'t a great block. School area is relatively safe right when it lets out, but most of us do not allow our kids to hang out up there after school. Also they have recently hired safety patrol parents who monitor the area as a result of some not so great scenarios and threats, but I don\'t have all the facts.\n7) At the end of the day - yes, this school probably prepared my son for the work load at a specialized high school but you really need to think about whether this is what you want for your child between the ages of 11-13 and whether they\'d be prepared for HS even if they didn\'t go here. The problem is there just aren\'t alot of choices in district 3 so there\'s not much between the grind of this school and the only other 2 major schools in this district.\n\n\nI hope this is helpful to those of you thinking about your choices for next week.', 'While not the author, I must disagree to your statement that the comment is fake. I am an 8th grader, and let me tell you that I think the same way as him/her. MS54 is not only amazing academically but also as a community. Sure, the cources are very hard, but your friends and teachers guide you through it.', 'I\'m sorry, but THIS comment is fake. I may be wrong but in this note you write similarly to the first note. You use the same expression, ""let me tell you."" Again, I might be wrong; there is always a possibility that two different people wrote in the same comment chain with the same opinion and using the same expression. Just saying.\n\nHowever, the first comment is most definitely not written by a student. No student would write, ""Ask yourself and your child this: Is he/she willing to make the effort? In a nutshell, any student would love this school, and you just need to stay happy and work hard!!"" or start bragging about the school by saying ""The students here will surprise you with their raw intelligence and pure talent. As a parent, you might have the notion that Middle schoolers are not capable of doing the things that is usually expected of high schoolers. Our chorus, strings, and jazz band is amazing, and the activities we do, such as a mock election for class president this year was astounding. The things Booker T. students are capable of doing is nothing less then astonishing."" or even say ""The homework at this school is in no way unbearable as many parents will have you think, it is simply what your child does with his/her time. These three years are not testing your ability to do a lot of homework, it is helping you improve your time management skills, which will be much needed for high school.""\n\nAnyway, I would simply like to express my opinion that the first note is DEFINITELY a fake. No student in the 8th grade would write in such an eloquent way. Of all people, I should understand, as I am an 8th grade honors student with a 98 and 99 average. However, I\'m ACTUALLY in 8th grade. I assume that a teacher wrote this or at least a parent did. \n\nThere are many false allegations in the original comment that I certainly disagree with. First of all, most teachers, especially in 8th grade, seem to want to get the job done instead of teaching and inspiring us. There are a few bright spots throughout the day, but I still dread waking up in the morning to go to school because I know I have to face my mediocre, least favorite teachers everyday.\n\nHalf of my class doesn\'t even care anymore, even in the honors program. They basically sleep through class, and don\'t care for what the teacher is taking about. However, the school puts SOOO much pressure on us to get high honor roll. Everyone knows who\'s in honors and who\'s in academic, because there is still so much pressure put on to us by the school that basically causes a social class divide, even though many of the students in academic should be in honors and vice versa. Only a month ago, two kids in an HONORS class came into school smelling like weed because they had done drugs the previous night at another kids party - a kid from Booker T.\n\nAt the high honor role ceremony at the end of the year last year, there was one person - ONE PERSON - from a certain academic class who made it on to high honor role all four marking periods. It was a pitiful sight that I can still picture. In many of the academic classes, no one makes it to the high honor role ceremony at all.\n\nThe first comment says,  ""Model UN delegates, like me, write essays every night about topics we choose and find interesting. (Only if they want to, that is.)"" It fails to note that while our Model UN is very accomplished and smart, the people chosen are completely random. Kids who goof off in class and ""forget"" to do their homework are chosen over incredibly smart kids, and academic kids rarely get chosen.\n\nThere is a severe difference between academic and honors. You will not find out which program you are in until 3 DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. The lying principal will have you believe that this is because there isn\'t a difference, but it\'s really because if you knew beforehand that you were in academic and what goes on in the separate classes, you would definitely choose a different school. I know a numerous amount of people who transferred out of academic into private school because the students and teachers were not focused on teaching or learning anything similar to the honors classes. I have personal experiences with this because my close friends have been in academic and hated it so much they decided to leave. The school wants you to believe that there HAS to be two programs for additional funding reasons, but when you go to the DOE website there is no such requirement. These decisions are entirely made by the school. Additionally, even if you are a student who received top scores at your elementary school, if you didn\'t do well on your state exams YOU WILL NOT BE IN HONORS.\n\nWhatever teacher or parent wrote the  first comment is flat out lying about the race issues at the school. They wrote, ""I am a 13 year old black boy, and I am one of the many minority children in the Honors division. This school does not care about ethnicity or social status, the only thing that matters is your will to learn and be focused."" This quote states the truth in one place: when it says that there are very few minority children in the honors program. The school has had many problems in the past concerning race, and these problems persist years later. There are legit 3 African American students in my class of around 31, and a few other minority students. Honors is primarily white students, while academic is much more diverse, as mentioned in the first reply to the top comment.\n\nRace issues don\'t only appear in honors and academic. The dean is a bully to all, but is especially mean to minority students (i.e. stopping them instead of a white kid for running.) He screams at most people in general and will literally push people into line when we line up to get into school in the morning.\n\nAs a student who has an after school activity every day after school, I would like to address another claim in the first comment that homework is easy if you don\'t procrastinate. THIS IS A BIG, FAT, GLORIOUS LIE. I am an extremely hard-working student. I start my homework right when I get home and usually don\'t get distracted and still end up finishing up at 12 or 1 in the morning. So, I have to ask the writer of the comment: Are you a robot human or just have superpowers? Because I don\'t know a single person who is so perfect they can say, with confidence, ""The homework content and the amount of it are both doable, and the cause for the stress of homework and not being able to finish it is solely the cause of not being focused and getting off task."" LIES.\n\nI apologize for the intensity of this comment, but the truths of this school just needed to be said.', 'I would not recommend this school. Too much stress, competition, homework, harsh grading system, virtually no way to interact with school. Happy children start feeling unhappy in this school. This school has college expectations from students just coming out of elementary school, which creates enormous stress for both children and parents.', ""I disagree. MS54 pushed you to your limit for your benefit. My latin teacher, Mr Barton, does colledge style seminars because he knows we are capable of it. And if you ever need help, your teachers are always happy to help. I'm an 8th grader doing 9th grade classes but I still feel relaxed and guided."", 'Yep, Mr. Barton is definitely a wonderful teacher. Plus, the tests he gives us make us think, but in a good way.', ""In a way, I understand what you mean. This is my last year at this school and I'm doing the 5th grade tours tomorrow. The first year was horrible for me. Not because of the school, but because of me. Indeed, stress was happening for me cause I was not at all used to this new way of life. There was stress, crying, sleepless nights and so on. So instead of focusing, I was too wrapped up in games because it made me happy. Perfect. Would stay beyond 3 AM at times. 7th grade, determined to do it differently and didn't play the games. Went so much better.\n\nMy point is, the sudden change is going to discourage the student if they aren't ready. It's so much better to talk to the teacher and explain how you feel, instead of yell at them. They are human, they understand your feelings and frustration. 6th grade, it's my math teacher's first year and and my poor mom is class parent. Why is that a bad thing at the beginning of the year? All the parents were yelling at both of them and telling the teacher they need to slow done in lessons. Doesn't help to yell and does tire them. For competition... perhaps. We don't make a big deal out of other test scores, but when someone does well, we cheer them on. Homework is meh if you know how to manage your time and actually do it. Basically all the teachers offer help because they truly want their students to do well. Harsh grading system... depends. You get a rubric/are told what to do unless your teacher wants you to decide. Participation, Test, Classwork, Homework and Behavior are important for the grade.\n\nI would have to disagree with the no interaction part, no offense. You can email teachers and staff in general in case of problems or questions. There are also a whole load of activities students can do after school as well. For example, I've been participating in the school play for the last two years and just auditioned for this years play yesterday.\n\nA good example of stress is the SHSAT, State Test, and Regions. Teachers are nice enough to go through ELA and Math preparation for the State Test, even if they hate it. My Humanities teacher last year hated teaching it yet went through the trouble for us.  \n\nNow, 8th grade is absolutely amazing and I love it to death. Sure, work work work, but it's much better to look on the positive side. \n\nI hope you and your child is happy where they are. \n\nHave a nice day!"", 'No way would I choice this school.  They do not tell you if your child is in ""honors"" or ""academic"" until three days before school starts.  In 2016 there were 2 academic classes and 8 honors classes, with (despite what the school says) a very distinct stigma attached to the academic classes, at least from the children\'s perspective who are very aware of the difference.  The school screens all the kids so there is no longer a need for this distinction. Why take the chance that your kid will be placed into the perceived ""dumb"" classes?', ""While i do agree about honors and academic, everyone is treated equally. I'm an 8th grade honors student but I don't see academic students as any less smart then me. Usually only kids who need extra help get into academic so that they can catch up."", ""When/how do incoming students find out if they're in the Gen Ed or Delta Honors program? Middle school matching letters just went out today and don't specify."", 'This school, with its good reputation, does a decent job of preparing students for public high school. The rumors about intense homework were not totally true. You can slip under the radar and do the minimum amount (one hour/day) without too many repercussions. Classes, particularly 8th grade math, are in fact very rushed. The teachers give many make-up options however so that grades overall tend to remain above 90. And there are ""early academies"" where kids can attempt to catch a teacher\'s more individualized attention. Some Pros: 1. Passionate instructors with very few bad apples thrown in (though there was at least one disastrous retirement ready teacher every year) 2. A very thorough high school counselor. 3. Enough electives to keep things interesting. 4. Friendly bright kids for the most part.  5. Good organization considering there are so many students. Some cons: 1. Reading and grammar are kept at a bare minimum. Kids are allowed to claim they read 40 books a term, whether they do or not  2.There are still ""academic"" classes that tend to group minorities together (though I hear this is changing). 3.Phys Ed is a bit of a bust, a lot of sitting around if you choose. 4.The supervisor, or ""dean"" in charge of conduct is a bully and does very little to hear students out when an issue occurs. Nevertheless this was a positive learning experience, not too warm or fuzzy, but education wise, pretty solid.', ""I am a former student of Delta and now that I am in high school, I didn't realize how unhappy I was here. There was so much work, and the constant pressure from students and even teachers to keep your grades up were incredibly high. I became very stressed in eighth grade; not just because of the high school process, but preparation for the Regents in June. It was an absolutely awful experience, for we only started to review in May, thus I felt as if I didn't do as well as I could have on the exams. Some teachers are good in each grade, and some are tough. I realized now that I attend a different school, Delta gave SO much homework. I also didn't realize how important humanities was to the academics. Most people felt that this was their most important grade, and their hardest class. Though, I must say, my best teachers were from my humanities classes. Mr. Barton, the Latin teacher, is truly the most significant in the school, though. 6th and 7th grade math was easy for me, but the level of difficulty in 8th grade shot through the roof. The teachers are more rushed to teach in eighth grade with the high school process and preparation for the Regents, but I never felt as if I fully understood each and every unit we did. This was just my experience. Hopefully the school has improved since I have left. Good luck."", 'I am currently an eighth grader at Booker T. Washington, and I would like to say that I think very highly of it. The homework is far from too much, as long as you don\'t procrastinate. I have spent a long time on assignments, or up to three hours on homework, but I tend to be an overachiever sometimes and I get distracted as well. So this shouldn\'t scare anyone considering the school: if you get the homework done efficiently and ask for help from friends or teachers, there is nothing to worry about homework-wise. \nI would like to respond to a previous statement someone made about teachers and favorites. Teachers have changed multiple times, so I am unsure whether I am speaking of the same teachers this person was speaking of, but I want to make it clear that while there are some teachers who have clear favorites and treat some with a smile and others with a frown, not all teachers are like this and there are many, such as my Humanities teacher, who keep completely neutral and try their best to help all the students in any way they can. This, in fact, has been my experience at Booker T. with all my teachers: they want you to succeed, not to fail, and what I have found is that it is better to ask questions if you don\'t understand a concept then to go home and not do the work because you ""didn\'t get it"". And yes, concepts can be confusing or frustrating sometimes but you work through it and most teachers are more than willing to help you out. \nI have so much more to say, but I think I should stop here before this gets to long.

In 7th grade my grades lowered to low nineties and high eighties from high nineties. Now my grades are horrible, 70's and 60's because of how much work the teachers give us. Though, it depends which teachers you have and if you are very capable of focusing all day. I wont say which elective, but I picked this one elective in sixth grade because I thought it would be fun, like most electives. Last year we had a different teacher and it was fun. But now we have a different one and its HORRIBLE we are not even learning the elective anymore. At the beginning of the year it was Okay but now its not. We have this project due soon and I have other important projects for more important classes, but I have to spend all my time on this and I am so stressed on this project because Im afraid my teacher will yell, or whatever. Sorry if this doesnt make any sense.

It\'s astonishing.', 'I am a current 8th grader in the ""honors"" program, and I\'d just like to write about my experience here. I\'m attending LaGuardia in the fall, and I literally can not wait to leave Booker T. I\'d like you guys to see the school from a student\'s perspective- not a parent\'s, who only sees the grades and the front the school puts on during parent teacher conferences. \n     All in all, my experience in this school wasn\'t exactly the best. There are only a  few amazing teachers in this school, who really are great people. The funny thing is these teachers don\'t teach science or math, they teach art and music- that means I\'m stuck with the undesirable  teachers everyday. These good teachers make me want to explore the world. They make me curious, and they make me laugh and just writing this makes me emotional because I\'m a very emotional person and I know I\'m gonna miss them a lot when I leave. \n     There is A LOT of favoritism in this school and it\'s very upsetting. Don\'t think I\'m saying this because I feel ""jealous"" and whatnot because I don\'t. I don\'t wake up everyday at the crack of dawn to be a teacher\'s pet. It\'s just that these teachers waste so much class time goofing off with their favorites and it really is annoying. Like come on man, shut up and teach us this so we can hopefully never see you again. That sounds harsh, I know, but I\'ve had a some bad experiences with injustice in this school. I\'m afraid to even ask questions in my math class, because I know that I will be yelled at and I\'m gonna feel like I\'m stupid. That\'s why I learn from the internet. :) But you see, that doesn\'t happen when the favorites ask questions. I could rant about all my individual experiences I\'ve had with injustice in this school, but it would bore you.\n     Really the only reason this bothers me so much is because the favorites are the same kids who smoke weed and hook up and bully others. Just a reminder, we are talking about 13-14 year old EIGHTH graders. These kids are the boys who once threw hurtful homophobic slurs at my friend, alongside the ""popular"" girls who wear pushup bras and crop tops with LEGGINGS and are never told anything about it, and gossip about everyone. My non-white friend once wore a sleeveless shirt and boy did she get told off by a teacher. They\'re ""popular"" for the wrong reasons, because sure as hell it\'s not for their fake personality. I\'ve seen a lot of nice people do bad things and change for the worst. I\'m just done with all these fake people and I can\'t wait for high school. Hopefully I won\'t need to see any of these kids again. If you read this entire thing, thank you. I could go on, but I\'d rather not.\nIf you\'re attending this school, I wish you the best.']"

Most teachers are dedicated, passionate and creative -- each in their own way. Most parents are giving, involved and dedicated members of the school community. And the kids are mostly bright, sweet, eager students. There are exceptions to all of the above (of course!). But in a school this big you are bound to come across a few less-than-impressive teachers, parents, kids.

The classes are big, lunchroom is crowded and the auditorium gets noisy -- but this is a NYC public school.

Would your child have a hard time with all that stimuli? No problem! According to a teacher in the ICT class, PS87 will give your child noise-cancelling headphones. That way they won\'t be bothered by the excess noise. Nor can they actually interact with any of their peers. Wonderful.\n\nThen let me mention the giant bucket of scissors I noticed on a bottom shelf of a kindergarten class. I think they were safety scissors...but then there was the one pair of adult scissors which was left on a low table. These kids are still young and, special needs or no, I think supervision with scissors is still a good idea.\n\nThe school literature (which was handed out at the tour) even goes so far as to say about the ICT classes (which are 60% gen ed, 40% special ed) ""Children on the general education side are \'model\' students–they must model excellent behavioral and learning habits."" Seriously? Do these gen ed children really get *nothing* else out of the experience of being with differently-abled peers other than just being models?? How about tolerance? Or empathy?

As a G&T parent myself, I found it hard to discuss the article and the issues it raised with other parents because they seemed so unwilling to even admit that the racial and ethnic mix in G&T did not match the composition of the school as a whole or the neighborhood. Among those who admitted this pretty undeniable fact, many took the position that it was unfortunate but basically harmless and out of our hands, since the school has no role in G&T admissions.\n\nIn 2014, the school community began to have more honest and productive conversations about the downsides of having multiple educational tracks in the same school and to acknowledge that the makeup of G&T is not representative of the community. The school's Comprehensive Educational Plan now includes two goals aimed at addressing some of these problems by creating more frequent and meaningful opportunities for children in different educational tracks to learn and play together and by working to diversify and increase parent involvement. Time will tell what we are able to accomplish but acknowledging the problems and trying to come up with creative solutions is the first step."", 'This article blatantly taints the reputation of the NYT.

03M165,"[""I'm a parent of a K student in the G&T class and the Urban Arts afterschool program. We've been very happy and are looking forward to another great year. Unlike many schools, ps165 does a good job of effectively integrating the dual language and g&t programs with the rest of the school (the g&t class is also notably more diverse than others I toured). My child's participation in Urban Arts and a school-wide recycling program (where she is a class rep) have helped her made good friends from outside the small g&t community, and both that experience and the arts activities have really added a lot to her year at PS165. At UA, the K/1 students participate in dance, chorus, visual arts, and drama. Older children also do drumming and other activities. The UA program is free (yay!), but does not fully meet demand so we were very lucky to be in the program this year. The PTA is active, hosting and organizing math, literacy and movie afternoons/evenings. If you are looking at g&t the classes are smaller here than the other D3 schools which means there is a lot of individualized attention. Other pluses: guitar taught in music, a kiln in the art studio means your child is exposed to something you can't really do at home, weekly optional chess afterschool, lots of positive reinforcement from many teachers throughout the school, large classrooms with big windows, an indoor gym that the school makes the most of. Minuses: tiny cafeteria means youngest kids eat very early, homework starts in K."", 'I am a parent of a First Grader in the Dual Language program and have been part of the school community for 2 years.   PS 165 is a pioneer in the DL Spanish program. We are not a spanish-speaking family and to have the chance for our child to learn a new language at a young age in a public school just a few blocks away, is truly priceless.  \n\nIn addition to its strong curriculum, (it is also a showcase school for math) every child has guitar lessons weekly, creates amazing ceramics in Art (I have been the delighted recipient of a coffee cup, and two vases!)    The school also partners with the NY Philharmonic (grades 3-5) and New Victory Theater.    Thanks to previous PTA Boards we have two ‘E3’ (Educate, Exercise, Evolve) sports coaches at recess  http://e3sports.com/school-programs/recess/  who in conjunction with the Special Aides, work to create and oversee structured play and games that are age specific and safe.    (There are no movies/cartoons for our students when it rains!!)\n\nAs working parents, the school’s relationship with the A.C.T after school program (at St. John the Divine) has been enormously beneficial to my husband and I.  ACT Counselors will collect the students every day at dismissal and walk them to the Cathedral.  Pick-up in the evening can be as late as 6:15pm.  Which is ideal when you are traveling from downtown.  The in-house after school clubs (YMCA and Urban Arts ) also offer a fantastic set of activities (finishing at 5/5:30pm )  such as Photography, Chorus, Drumming, Theater, Dance.  There is also an after-school chess club on tuesdays.\n\nIn short:  PS 165 is a jewel in the crown.  My son is happy to go to school every day, is learning in a safe environment, and has made some wonderful friends.    Oh, and the parents are great too! :)', 'While the dual language teachers are excellent (because they themselves excellent), PS165 is NOT a pioneer in the DL Spanish program. Far from it, in fact. There are many schools in the area who have longer running, more robust, and sought after DL Spanish programs. PS165’s program may, however, benefit from the larger than average number of native Spanish speakers attending the school. \n\nMoreover, this school is in NO WAY a “showcase school for math”. Unless you interpret that to mean showcasing how to do basic mathematics incorrectly.\n\nI have witnessed their disastrous mathematics instruction firsthand. Their math test scores are below average (and median) and are otherwise disappointing. There’s a reason why. Hint: it is not the curriculum, which is literally scripted. \n\nPlease do not let this wave of glowing reviews fool you. PS165 was revisited by Insideschools early in 2019 (a visit that was an extreme priority and focus of “effort” for the school considering their previous subpar review) and it is no coincidence this flood of overly positive reviews began around that time. \n\nLastly, consider the composition of G&T classrooms. If there are 10 children in each of these classes, wouldn’t it follow logically they would have a more successful learning experience and environment than the remainder of classes with nearly 30 children each? \n\nUse your best judgement, but proceed with caution here.', 'It IS a showcase school for math. The dual language program is excellent and is better than other schools in the district. The classes are small. IT’S A DIVERSE SCHOOL- racially, academically, and socio-economically—which is hard to find in one of the most segregated school district in the country. I’m an educator in the district and I’m familiar with EVERY school in the district. It sounds like you have some personal issues that you are frustrated with so you are taking out your aggression anonymously on the internet rather than in person with the school.', 'Being a “showcase school” does not mean the school claims to have high math test scores. PS 165 is a showcase school for the Number Talks math program because they have multiple events throughout the year where educators and administrators from across NYC are welcomed to observe the program in action. The school showcases the program in various classroom settings/age groups. \n\nhttps://www.showcaseschools.org/our-program', 'Our daughter is in the Dual Language first grade classroom. She is learning a lot academically and socially, and she comes home happy from school every day. The teachers cultivate warmth and kindness in the classroom, and the students are very supportive of each other. We are grateful that our child has the opportunity to learn a second language and we really like the way in which Math is taught in the school. Our daughter also greatly enjoys all the ‘specials’: Art, Music, Technology and Gym. \n\nThe school administration has been increasingly responsive to parent feedback and suggestions, and we have experienced a friendly and welcoming environment. We are pleased that PS 165 has a school uniform, as we feel this is equalizing, while also reducing pressure on parents and students to decide what to wear each morning. We appreciate the fact that PS 165 reflects the diversity of our neighborhood and we are very glad to be part of this community.', ""Our child is in prek at PS 165 and we love it. Lots of play and circle time involves a lot of movement and discussion, not just following directions. The teachers are very experienced and work well together and with the kids. Parents are always welcome in the classroom and to talk about concerns in person or over email. \n\nIt feels weird to even bother mentioning this when it's already 2019, but just in case it helps anyone: This school is queer friendly. Our child identifies as a he and wears all kinds of clothes including dresses and we have only ever heard compliments about it. I am queer myself and see many different kinds of families in the school and everyone seems to be welcomed. I have not heard anything negative in this arena."", 'I really love the teachers, academics, culture of inclusion, and genuine warmth of the PS 165 community! We had such a good experience after my son started here in Pre-K, we committed to staying. He is now in the G&T Kindergarten class, and still has opportunities for shared times with the kids in the dual language and general ed classes which I am pleased with. As far as educational philosophy goes, I wanted a school with strong academics in a traditional sense, but yet a place that is progressive too and understands children need circle time and to move around. This is also a school which places a high emphasis on developing social emotional skills. The insights written above reflect our experience with the school. It is all about balance and we are very happy here.', ""Great school! I graduated from here back in 1999 and decided to bring my son here as his cousins go here and grandmother is so close. He is special needs and requires a lot of detailed attention which his Pre-K teachers Mrs.Coqueron and Mrs. Martinez gave him. He developed so well in that first year we kept him there to attend K with Mrs.Chiavetta. She teaches a 12-1-1 class and works every lesson to each childs' needs and requirements. I cannot explain how much he has progressed with interactions and reading. He is 5 and can now write in script, and Kanji. He is starting to know multiplication, Spanish, Japanese, and has an obsessive curiosity about all things in nature! 100% worth the 1 hour commute!"", '', 'Thanks for the update. We revised the profile to reflect the fact that the school no longer serves grades 6-8. Our data is from the 2017-18 school year. We will post new data for the 2018-19 school year when it is available next summer. Clara Hemphill', ""I can't say enough good things about this school. My son is in Mrs. Sanches' Pre-K class (but both class teachers are terrific), and the individual attention each child receives is truly commendable. She often takes the time to talk about any issues and really work with the parents so that we can help at home. My son has matured and learned so much- both academically, and socially. I've also taken an active role at the PTA meetings, and have befriended many other parents who have kids in both the dual language programs, and gifted and talent programs. I've only heard wonderful things about both programs, especially dual language. They've just started offering an after-school program, but not for Pre-K. I hope they eventually extend to Pre-K"", 'This is a stellar school in district 3! My child is in the dual language Kindergarten class at PS 165 this year and I am thrilled with this school. It has exceeded my expectations and I believe it is a hidden gem in District 3 that many families aren’t aware of. My kid is excited to go to school every day and has made a lot of friends.\n\nThe teachers at PS 165 are top notch! They really care about our kids and are passionate about their work. I have volunteered at the school a lot this year so I have gotten to know several of the teachers and have been very impressed by their commitment, enthusiasm, creativity and focus. They take every opportunity to develop new programs and evolve their curriculum. I also feel the teachers help cultivate a culture of inclusiveness – the children I have observed seem to treat their peers with respect and kindness.\n\nPS 165 is a Showcase School for Math. Having a strong mathematics program was really important to me while searching for schools for my child. Considering the fact that the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked the United States 40th in the world for math literacy, I greatly respect that the school is being recognized for improving its teaching methods in math so that our kids can be on par with students around the world.\n\nThe school also puts a strong emphasis on reading and writing and I have been happy with the progress my child’s kindergarten class is making in literacy.  \n\nI can’t say enough good things about the Spanish-English dual language immersion program! It is utterly incredible to watch my child progress in a second language that we don’t speak at home. I am now often getting corrected for my rudimentary Spanish (that I learned in high school in the early 1990s) by my Kindergartener! I can’t wait to see my child’s level of fluency by 5th grade!\n\nPerhaps one of the most exciting things that is happening at the school is that the technology coursework is being transformed so it will be STEAM/MakerSpace focused. It is in its early stages but will be scaled up and the goal is that our children will become trained to be creators of technology and media instead of consumers of it. Already, coding has been implemented into the curriculum and my kindergartener is already doing things that go over my head!\n\nLastly, because I personally have always been more into creative subjects, I just love the school’s art program! The school has a kiln, so all the kids learn pottery, and I have noticed my child’s artistic initiative and ability at home greatly improve since starting at the school.  In addition, our kids are learning guitar every week in music class! I am hard pressed to imagine a more well-rounded education that my kid could get at any other Manhattan public elementary school.\n\nAre there any drawbacks to the school? Well, I think no school is perfect. I will say that the building, although bright, spacious and clean, is very old and doesn’t have elevators, so severely physically disabled children (or their disabled parents) would have to choose another school that is accessible. Also, for parents who like extremely progressive schools, this is not one of them. PS 165 definitely embraces the whole child philosophy but is more academically rigorous (without being suffocating) than some other schools, though I do believe that the staff still provide a very nurturing environment for children. I also believe that our children will be more academically prepared for the challenges of middle and high school.\n\nThe PTA at PS 165 is active and very dedicated. A lot of great parents dedicate so much of their time to initiating events and addressing challenges. \n\nPlease note that as of September 2018, PS 165 will be only a K-5 school, and will no longer have a middle school.  In general, the middle school test scores were lower than the elementary school’s but because both schools were tallied together as one school, the average overall scores were brought down. In the past, many of PS 165’s high performing students have gone on to attend some very competitive and high performing middle schools while MS 165 would accept students from other elementary schools that didn’t offer such strong academics to prepare them for junior high school.\n\nHonestly, the best way to know if the school is good for your child is to tour it and get a real feel for it. I am embarrassed to admit I had many misconceptions about PS 165 – based on outdated reviews from various sites, tests scores and an overall lack of knowledge about the school – and wasn’t even going to consider it until I visited it for myself and spoke to parents there. Anyone who wants their child to get a well-rounded education that includes strong math and literacy programs but also gives him/her the chance to learn a musical instrument and enjoy a wonderful art program should definitely check out PS 165.', ""PS 165 ELA and math test scores have shown marked improvement under Principal Aracelis Castellano-Folk's leadership; however, parents still express concern over school climate, with some choosing to send their children to neighboring schools. The New York Times reported on these concerns and wider efforts to diversify New York City schools <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/school-segregation-nyc-district-3.html?_r=1>in this report</a>."", ""My daughter started in the G & T program in 2012. She has had dedicated classroom and specialty teachers.  Many of her classmates have been together since kindergarten and we've developed a close knit class community.  As far as the school at large, I've seen positive changes and additions over the years.  Through the PTA, I've gotten to know school administrators, staff and families who each have a stake in helping to make the school the best it can be. As another post mentioned, the DOE/public schools is not perfect by any means, but my daughter is getting a good education and enjoys going to school each day."", 'My son has been at this school since Fall of 2013, when he joined the G&T program as a kindergartner. He is currently in the 3rd grade.  Like all public schools, there are things that I wish were different, but that being said, my son is getting an excellent education and has amazing teachers.  We have been thrilled with his teachers each year.  What is particularly nice is that the teachers really are carefully placed to teach the grade that works best with their specific qualifications/personalities.  Each teacher has always been available and open with us parents.  Additionally, the cluster classes are fantastic.  My son has art, music and technology each week and gym two times per week.  We are very happy with the education our boy is receiving.', 'My daughter attended preK at 165 last year and is currently enrolled in Spanish dual language kindergarten. She did well enough on the G&T test to receive a district G&T offer at another school, but we decided to stay at 165.\n\nI had some trepidation about the school culture, namely, would kids be nice to each other? I can truly say that both the kids in her class and the older children on her floor (preK, K and 1st grade share the 2nd floor of the school) have been remarkably kind and supportive of each other. PreK kids have their own bathroom in their classroom, but K and 1st graders leave the classroom with a buddy and go to the bathroom down the hall. When walking in the neighborhood after school, my daughter has pointed out other little girls on the sidewalk, saying “I know her! She helped me with the paper towels,” etc. The principal has brought Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” into the school through The Leader in Me program, and seems sincerely committed to the initiative. \n\nhttp://www.theleaderinme.org/\n\nOne of the habits, “think win-win,” is particularly well-suited to a zoned neighborhood school. Parents and schools obviously should work together for the children, but sometimes it can seem like an oppositional relationship. I do think Principal Castellano cares about the students and wants them to do well. \n\nThe teaching staff in preK and Kindergarten are uniformly good. Some schools, even ones with good reputations, allow ineffective teachers to linger, but I have not seen that at PS 165.\n\nWhen I read comments here, I like to know something about the person writing them, so I’ll say that on the progressive/traditional education philosophy spectrum I’m in the middle – it’s important to me that the curriculum be age-appropriate,  and that a school be aware of the significant cognitive change that happens to children around age 7. \n\nTo go back to The Leader in Me initiative, one of its tenets is “Instead of seeing children through the lens of a normal distribution curve—some kids are naturally smart and others are not—The Leader in Me paradigm sees that every child is capable, every child is a leader. This paradigm changes everything.” Instead of “Educators control and direct learning,” the Leader in Me process moves toward “Educators empower students to lead their own learning.”\n\n https://psms165.org/leader-in-me/\n\nOn the downside, recess and lunch are too short. Kindergartners have 47 - 50 minutes to eat and burn off steam, and I believe it remains the same through 5th grade. However, that is a problem at every zoned school in District 3.  Administration has shown commitment to an outdoor recess, and the school usually has two play yards, although only one is operational until a major roof repair is finished.\n\nI’ve watched the K/1st grade recess from across the street many times, and I‘d encourage prospective parents to do the same. While some school aides behave very differently when the Vice Principal is present as opposed to when she is not, I’m confident that my child is safe at school on the playground, in the bathroom, and in the classroom. I don’t mean just physically safe but also safe from teasing & meanness. I’ve observed my child’s classroom teacher intervene when kids are not getting along, and she handles it exactly how I would hope she would. For example, with teasing, she calls attention to the reaction of the teased child: “Look at Billy’s face. Does he like what you are doing? No? Then stop doing it.” And the kids do. She is teaching them empathy & awareness of others every day.\n\nThe test scores published on insideschools include the middle school (grades 6/7/8). This is why test scores on insideschools are lower than the state test scores in the Kindergarten handbook published by the DOE, which only includes 3rd/4th/5th grades. If you are considering PS 165 for elementary school, the DOE handbook gives a more accurate picture.', 'District 3 families who applied to PS 165 for pre-k are being sent to the East Village instead.

In 2011, we decided to enroll him and have not regretted our decision!  Our son has had wonderful teachers who nurture him, challenged him and keep him engaged.

He comes home with diversity in learning such as: singing songs learned in one week, bringing different types of artwork and discussing human nature. His homeroom teachers are wonderful – they instruct the children on a solid foundation of basic learning from the alphabet, numbers, analogy, etc. as well as guiding them in emotional development outside of their home. He had attended programs at Dwight, Mandell, Metropolitan Montessori and MetroKids - all from which he really benefited and thrived. My husband and I had researched as many schools possible - both private and public, in the UWS and Midtown area; and we’re happy with this academic program and close-knit community promoted. The enhancement teachers (music, movement and art) are wonderful and have connections with Juilliard, Laguardia HS, etc. Mandarin begins weekly this month for PreK and the lower grades. The after school program for PreK is Hudson Guild and pick up is by 6PM for about $400-500/month. Kindergarten-6th Grade after school is the YMCA until 5:45PM; and it’s free. The school was built around 3 years ago (the first “new” Manhattan school in about 30 years) and the classrooms are very large with lot of windows - each with their own bathroom and access to a private playground – it’s just as described on their website with state of the art technology from touch screen teaching monitors in every classroom (I’ve only seen that in charter schools so far), 3D printers, computers in every classroom and the library. The administration is very involved in the student body’s academic and social well-being. The interim principal, Mr. Stephen Hernon, is intelligent, friendly and respectful with the students, the teachers and administration team. The parent coordinator, Ms. Damaris Carrion, (she’s been there for about two decades) is the school conduit and has been instrumental in the transition of the school’s relocation and development. There are five PreK classes - many children enrolled are zoned for P.S. 199 or P.S. 452. I believe RSMA is the only public school for which the DOE provides the assistant PreK teacher for each class. Other area public schools’ PTAs/PAs raise funds to pay their assistant PreK teachers’ salaries. RSMA is the only area public school that currently has no suggested annual contribution minimum. I have been quoted at other public schools’ annual amounts from $300 to $2,400. Our PTA is a terrific group of parents and teachers who are effective as they are cooperative. They started the school’s first annual fundraiser party 3 years ago and it’s been very successful.

We had a few incidents with students hitting our daughter, spitting and being disrespectful. I honestly dont feel that it was handled appropriately. There are too many troubled kids in this school. I see a lot of disrespectful kids, cursing and acting in a way that is inappropriate, but then again parents come in to pick up their kids smelling like marijuana. I feel the teachers are caring and I give them a lot of credit for dealing with such behavior issues. Also security guards lately are not professional as in the past. My daughter will not be attending middle school here. I honestly can't wait for her to leave. I don't feel the same as I use to about the school. We use to be involved with volunteering and such, but I have lost all interest.  Also, so unhappy with afterschool. The counselors really don't have a handle on the upper grade kids. Afterschool program was so well runned when Mr. Roger's was there.

He receives that comfortable push at school and I have seen his reading grow immensely.  Since the weather is nice these days, my son's class goes to the park to read, write and of course play.  His social skills have grown beautifully and he is truly happy with his school.  As a result of his last experience in PreK, I can truly say that all of my hard work of searching for a school that was the right fit for my son has paid off.

The G&T program offers a rigorous curriculum, which prepares students to perform well on the state exams. Yes, the test-prep is intense (one critique that I have), but schools must perform well to maintain student enrollment, and secure funding. In that regard, I understand the catch-22. The enrichment programs are an additional benefit, as students have access to the Juilliard music program, drama, and art (to name a few). The music teacher (Ms. DJ), who is largely (if not fully) responsible, for integrating the Juilliard program in this school, is phenomenal. She is so committed to ensuring her students are exposed to the arts, many of whom had little to no prior experience playing a musical instrument. Despite her student's novelty, she embraced them with open arms. The parent coordinator (Ms. Damaris) spends countless hours planning elaborate school events to strengthen the school community.  Lastly, the after-school YMCA program is amazing. Mr. Desmond (the coordinator), Ms. Jasmine (a counselor), and Mr. Jesus (a counselor) are so courteous and upbeat. They genuinely adore kids.

I came into this school during sixth grade and I can say as a former student, my experience was not pleasant. I'm unsure as to if everyone experienced what I experienced in middle school or if it was just RSMA. The school was moved into a new building and the building is beautiful, however the people in it aren't as good as the outside seems like they are. Some of my innocent friends and classmates were picked on and harassed for things beyond their control such as hair, smell, birthmarks, appearances, sexuality, wealth, disorders, etc. Teachers are constantly disrespected. I don't think there has been a day where a certain math teacher of mine has gone home without feeling gloomy due to the amount of disrespect that is thrown at her. Kids are constantly cursing at her, threatening her, calling her names, and it is truly a miracle she hasn't left this school yet. The students here are not respectful at all, especially in the upper school. The school doesn't seem to take higher measures on this either. A friend of mine was slapped in the face and bullied for a whole year, and while, the teachers noticed this, they didn't do a thing at all and seemed to just watch from the sidelines as my friend who didn't seem to do anything wrong was crying and being bullied. There are also fights everyday, as it seems the kids are easily influenced to participate in physical violence, rather than using their voice to settle a matter. There should be consequences to these actions other than suspension, lectures, calling of parents, taking away privileges, or other ineffective measures. This school is not safe and I was constantly living in fear and anxiety of being picked on or having something worse done to me, although I am pretty sure from what I experienced, it already has. I am unsure as to whether the behavior of these students is due to the school environment or it is just themselves. However, one thing I am sure of is that middle school wasn't it for me and in this school, it may not be for your child or you either."", 'Thank you for your honest review.

I was in a PTA meeting  and was held captive in a lockdown and got no information what was happening if my child was effected. Further more my 5 year old was exposed to a child throwing chairs at teacher and unacceptable language. Do not send your happy healthy and emotionally well children here they will be traumatized.', 'I was at the same PTA meeting, am a parent on the School Leadership Team, and our family has attended PS191 for the past three school years. As communicated in a debrief by Principal Keville at our SLT meeting a few days later, as well as via a letter sent home through all students, there was a parent in the main office (not a student), that required the police to be called. The emergency procedures taken were executed per the DOE required school safety plan, and was intended to minimize disruption to the students. It was not the case that students were exposed to a ""violent"" or unsafe situation. To note, over the past three years we have been in attendance, there were two prior incidents in the surrounding neighborhood - a shooting on a construction site, and the bomb threat at Time Warner Center - in which similar emergency procedures were executed. RSMA staff communicated those procedures to families in a timely manner and also hosted additional info sessions on safety procedures and how students and staff prepare in drills. When asked, none of the shelter-ins have resulted in my child reporting disruption or distress. \n\nFor those who have feedback on communication or safety procedures, I invite you to attend monthly SLT meetings in which there is an open forum for family and community members. We are always looking for ways to improve communication and family participation and welcome you to the discussion. Meeting dates are posted to the school website.', 'So by your own admission nothing was explained on this day.  Second the letter sent home was extremely vague a parent who wasn’t present would not know the level of panic that one would have experienced. Incidents involving parents and police aren’t normal. So no matter how you try to frame it what I wrote stands true. And the fact that this school has a week administrative staff that allows bullying and inappropriate things to happen stands incontrovertible. But thanks for your two cents.', ""I am a parent whose aim is to raise children whose excellence expands beyond test scores to encompass an academic and professional future driven by hard work, self-awareness, purpose, and desire for positive impact in their communities. I thus looked for a public school environment that would support my children in academic growth, socialization and problem-solving among classmates who represent the socio-economic diversity that is NYC, exposure to a depth of curricular enrichment (fine arts, language, music, dance, maker), and increased cultural sensitivity via national heritage celebrations, community activism projects, and study of self-identity. Upon my first visit to PS191 on a Pre-K tour (when the school was located in the older building), I immediately felt the warm vibe of community that I sought for my son. In our family's last 3 years of attendance (Pre-K, K, 1st grade), RSMA has surpassed my expectations on all of the fronts I desired and I have had the pleasure of watching my son grow into a high achieving, well-rounded, empathetic, and engaged child. I learn from him, his teachers, and the many school-hosted family activities. I am confident that as he continues his journey through middle school at RSMA, the staff and curricula will guide him towards being a confident, committed, and curious learner. I am even more enthusiastic in seeing his baby sister start Pre-K in a few years, as the friendly school community already recognizes and welcomes her. \n\nFor a historically under-resourced public school, I am constantly impressed by RSMA's level of commitment to innovative learning and finding ways to accept and empower students that may be marginalized elsewhere. Whether it's a first grade field trip to see Faith Ringgold's 125th Street Station mosaic murals of Harlem Heroes and Heroines, to a night of sharing food and traditions at the Family Multi-Cultural Fair, to tinkering with MakerState scratch-coding and 3D printing, RSMA students gain exposure to powerful futures of what is possible, as leaders and pioneers, and with paths forward to getting there."", 'My daughter is a pre-k student at RSMA and as a first time mom, this has been a great experience for our family.  Yes, the school building is new and beautiful.  But, there is much more to this school than its building.  This is truly a community.  You see and feel that from the moment you arrive.  Principal Kelville often greets each family and/or student when they arrive and with each ""hello"" you can tell that she cares for each and everyone of the students.   I\'ve watched her talk to students who may have been absent the day before to see if they are feeling better - or to understand if there\'s something else going on.  Every student has a healthy respect for her and she shows it right back.  That ""community feeling"" permeates throughout the halls - from the security staff, to the librarian, to Ms. Jones (the art teacher) and Ms. M (the dance teacher) - RSMA has such a wonderful sense of community that by the time I get to the classroom I\'m reminded that my daughter is in safe hands.  And her teach - Ms. Manigault - is the B.E.S.T.  She could really be called the G.O.A.T.  She sincerely cares for each child and works with them where they are to succeed.  My daughter far exceeds the normal milestones for her age/grade due to the curriculum and individual attention that she receives in the classroom -- and the reinforcement of that at home via the homework packets.  Yes!  Pre-K has homework -- so that the children can learn the education lessons AND the lifelong lessons of responsibility.  I can\'t say enough great things about RSMA.

They keep communication with me  to ensure my kids stay motivated and make noticeable progress academically. The teachers are wonderful and the administrative staff is very pleasant and accommodating as well. I would highly recommend this school!', ""This is my son's second year at PS 191, and after coming from another school within the district we couldn't be more happier with PS 191. From the very first tour we felt at home, like we had been a part of the PS 191 family for decades. I feel that the overall school mission, tone and message is reciprocated daily to family and students. My son has continued to thrive academically and has been supported in many ways emotionally at PS 191. The teachers at PS 191 have continuously been able to feed my child's hunger for exploring new things and have heightened his level of curiosity. The arts and science program have continued to keep him in awe and spike an interested in future college plans. I think the diversity and multi-cultural atmosphere within PS 191 is the exact environment I believe can breed amazing things within the public school system."", 'My son is a 1st grader this year and has been a student since Pre-K.  The growth he has experienced in the past three years is tremendous.  Starting with Ms. Edwards PK class, he gained valuable social emotional skills as well as an exposure to guitar (Ms. Edwards plays) and sign language.  His guitar interest has since grown and has become a core personal interest and discipline for him.  In K, Ms. Dixon made such a huge impact on my son\'s reading skills that we are still blown away to this day.  At the start of K, my son was still sounding out letters and vowels.  By the end he was reading at level D to E, effectively reading comic books on his own.  His growth was exponential.  It has continued through to 1st grade with Ms. Sydney who is a recent addition to the staff and a super star.   In addition to taking my son\'s reading to level L and beyond, she is a caring and nurturing teacher who also helped to build a sense of community and empathy amongst the class.  We just finished our parent teacher\'s conference yesterday (which btw is student-led, my son presented and discussed his own work!  very effective method and great for parents) and we couldn\'t be more proud.  Academically, my son is currently above benchmark, but more important than that, the social and emotional skills he has gained these past three years is irreplaceable.  There is something intangible but hugely valuable to be gained when a child spends time getting to know and working with other classmates that may have different interests, backgrounds and means.  This is something that I think is largely overlooked today in lieu of keeping up with the ""rat race"".  The irony is the rat race has proven to be an effort with diminishing returns and increasingly high barriers as the college application scandal this past week has come to exemplify.  To parents who have that inkling that there may be another, better way, a road less travelled perhaps, I recommend taking a look at RSMA.  There are fantastic teachers, staff and learning opportunities awaiting.  And no waitlists...  for now.', 'My children go to this school, they love it and so do I. Great staff and teachers, the parent coordinator, Damaris, is very active and supportive. Their after school program is managed by YMCA and they are also excellent. My kids teachers have been Ms Manigault, Ms Dixon, Ms Quereshi, Ms Angelique, Ms Hylton and Ms Sydney; they are all super teachers on every level.', ""This school has been a blessing for our family, plain and simple. We came from Queens 2 years ago and since day one this staff has been superb, Damaris Carrion, the parent coordinator is a lovely human being, always attentive and aware of all matters in our family. Last year I had a brain surgery and she and the whole school staff and teachers were mindful of me and my kids' situation and feelings. On the academic regard, my children have improved greatly on every aspect of reading, writing, dancing and arts and their behavior and interests are in line with what I can see is going to be a brilliant future. All the teachers my children have had so far are simply excellent, we love Ms Sydney, Ms Hylton, Ms Quereshi, Ms Javier, Ms Manigault, Ms Dixon, Ms DJ, Ms Combo, Ms Moncebaiz, Ms Jones, and yes, this sounds like a lot of people, but it actually takes a team to bring up a good human being. They all work with us in a partnership to follow and support our two kids every step of the way. I highly recommend this school to anyone that wants to feel his child loved and challenged in a positive way."", 'My two children have been attending this school for three years and since then we are fascinated with their academic growth. RSMA has a trained and committed staff. They know each student, their parents, they carry out educational activities that are very fun for the whole family! My children enjoy going to school and I am happy!', ""My daughter is currently in pre-K at RSMA.  The staff is wonderful - the principal and assistant principal greet all the kids and parents as they enter the building each morning.  The parent coordinator is amazing - she knows all of the kids and parents and has tremendous energy and enthusiasm.  The pre-K teachers are great - Ms. Aster is a patient, nurturing teacher who works closely with parents to make sure the kids are getting what they need from the school and that any correction in behavior is a join effort.  My daughter has made a lot of progress with Ms. Aster in her writing and math skills so far this year.  The school has a lot of great activities for the kids - they learn spanish and mandarin, participate in music and chorus concerts, along with dance and art.  The new building is great - little ones have their own playground which is only accessible through the school, which I love.  The little kids are kept relatively separate from the older kids, which I appreciate because there's such a wide age range between pre-K and 8th grade.  Pre-K students eat breakfast and lunch in the classroom.  The PTA has become more active, hosting an auction for the first time last year to raise funding for the school, along with lots of other fundraising activities.  There are lots of opportunities to engage with the full school community during various family events.  We have nothing but positive things to say about our experience so far!"", 'I love the staff here as well as the location. The teachers are excellent they really help the students. The academic is up to standard however I do believe they should focus more on the 6-8th grade students when it comes to behavior and values. Over all this is a great school. As to the principal I really don’t hear nor see much off. The after school and sports are a great part of this school. I like the way this school always has an event happening for the students. \n\nRSMA is a school I would recommend to any parent.', ""My son graduated RSMA's middle school last June. He has severe ADHD and experiences intermittent focus lapses across activities. He is an amiable, creative boy who typifies the struggles of a different learner. RSMA staff engaged my wife and I in a partnership to identify effective strategies to maximize our son's academic and social success. After some initial fits and starts, the teachers and staff found an effective, multifaceted approach to motivating and supporting our boy in class, while we provided reinforcement at home. This collaborative and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of a special needs student exemplifies the effectiveness of RSMA's parent-teacher compact. Working in concert, the staff across grades and subject areas, were able to help our son explore and refine his creative ability, maximize his social emotional development, improve his academic performance, and build self-confidence. The unleashing of his creativity, through STEAM/Maker learning, positioned him to excel in architecture and digital design in high school. Of course, our son's special needs persist, but now he's armed with the knowledge that he can achieve on a high school level. Thinking back to our quest for a middle school, I remember the indecision my wife and I had in making a choice. We had several choices that various people recommended to us, and who knows - they might have worked out. One thing we know for sure - we made the right choice for our son. Despite the social trials and tribulations of middle school, and the challenges of a unique learning style, our son recently said that he really misses his middle school. He visits often and looks forward to alumni events in the future. We asked him why he likes going back - he has a pretty exciting high school life to occupy his time. With a big grin, he recently told us that RSMA is the place where he found himself. RSMA is the place where we as a family found what we needed."", 'School leadership focuses on the lower school, and middle school seems to be an afterthought.  6th graders are not using the science lab, limited arts as part of curriculum.  Principal doesn’t’ seem to have a multi-year plan for the middle school, or at least doesn’t’ share or talk about it. PTA meeting participation is limited to 3-5 families.  WIN program is a waste of time, not WHAT I NEED, but a period for reading in addition to the library reading time regardless if you need it or not.  Would strongly recommend you to think about joining the school if you are looking for a middle school.  Communication is terrible, events and activities are communicated last minute, with clear issues between the PTA and the school coordinator in terms of roles and responsibilities.  Teachers all seem great and dedicated, but leadership is the problem with the school.', ""my daughter is in pre-k this year and so far we are happy with the \nprogram. beautiful space, safety has never been a concern, students including my daughter \nseem very happy overall. field trips have been fun. activities in the \nclass seem educational and fun. my daughter has learned a lot so far. \nteachers are caring. i don't see much of the principal but then again my\n daughter is prek."", ""my daughter is in pre-k this year and so far we are happy with the program. safety as never been a concern, students including my daughter seem very happy overall. field trips have been fun. activities in the class seem educational and fun. my daughter has learned a lot so far. teachers are caring. i don't see much of the principal but then again my daughter is prek."", ""One year after the contested District 3 rezoning, it remains to be known whether PS 191's demographics, previously predominantly students of color and low income, will markedly change.

The school is not equipped to give kids a solid education after PK-K, and they graduate 8th grade absolutely ill-prepared for high school. Behavior problems are also an issue that the school cannot cope with. Additionally, the school has major communications problems that they refuse to acknowledge and recognize, much less fix. The administration is overwhelmed and does not understand the value of supplying a good foundation, but instead focuses on looking good on paper, e.g. funding for a media lab or a drive for a library that they do not have programming for. There are a few dedicated teachers, but the bar is set very low overall, so everyone\'s expectations about what can be accomplished are minimal, even the good teachers. The school has very few mechanisms for parent participation or involvement in their children\'s learning experience--ex. graded assignments are kept in a portfolio that does not come home and is very difficult to get ahold of (we tried, multiple occasions, with multiple teachers). Another example of how extreme the problems are is the lack of consistency in whether and how the teachers communicate--we had some take over a month to answer initial emails, and others who never answered. Despite extreme efforts on our end, we have very little idea of what is happening in the classroom. Every time we brought up any one of these issues, the school would give a ""well what happened that time was"" excuse. The move to the new school is going to decrease the quality of education even further, as they are administratively overwhelmed as it is. The principal loves to say that she ""can\'t wait to see the faces of the kids on the first day,"" which is indicative of exactly her approach--shiny toys to distract from solid plans to improve education, discipline, and the kids\' day-to-day experience. We feel we would be remiss in not warning other parents of this terrible choice in schools that again, looks good on paper because of the funding here and there for programs that do not exist or are temporary by design (ex. Mandarin).', 'What you have stated is not indicative of the this school at all.  Sorry you had such a bad experience.

My daughter recently graduated and is heading to middle school. While we are both happy that she is appropriately transitioning to middle-school, we are also both completely saddened by the idea that we will be leaving our local fantastic school. Our journey at YDMA began in first-grade, and I can honestly say that my daughter has thoroughly enjoyed calling YDMA her home school. She has benefited from being taught by master teachers in almost every grade she has attended, as well as, receiving awesome support inside the classroom and out. In 2013, my daughter broke her leg, we were thankful that we attended our local school because after a week she was back in school and the school did everything possible to accommodate her needs without my prompting. They (the Principal and staff) probably do not know to this day, how much I appreciated their support during that crisis.\nI also want to give a plug to the International Baccalaureate (IB) designation received by the school in 2014. The Principal and her staff worked very hard to achieve this goal. I can say that through instruction, project work and an environment built around IB attributes and attitudes, my daughter has become a much more globally aware individual, who is also a budding feminist. I firmly believe her development at YDMA under the IB curriculum has had a lot to do with the positions that she now takes. To boot, the fact that she stakes out a position is a direct result of the instruction she has received (I should probably take some credit here too!)\nFinally, it is unrealistic to suggest that this or any other school operates without deficits and/or problems. There have been many negative comments on this site about leadership. I cannot agree with what is said here, as an engaged parent who sat on the SLT and the PTA, I always found the leadership to be responsive to me in my advocacy for my own child, but also in advocacy for every child in the building. One glaring problem that exist at the school is minimal parental involvement, we currently have one of the hardest working PTA Presidents, who has done yeoman's work to corral our parents. This is an area that is still a work in progess, and it is my hope that should you decide to attend this school you will be prepared to roll-up your sleeves to work for the continued improvement of this school. That is what I did, and I can say that in the four years we were there, the school achieved its IB status and improved upon a host of other issues. This school can only get better, and it will especially do so if parents in the Harlem community embrace it and work with the leadership and the master teachers in the building to make it the exemplar of a public IB school it is destined to be."", 'The family of a kindergarten student who ran into a brick wall in the playground is suing the Department of Education for failing to prevent the accident, <a href=""http://nypost.com/2016/05/15/family-sues-after-boy-runs-into-brick-wall-at-school-playground/?utm_source=Master+Mailing+List&utm_campaign=94e0119baa-Rise_Shine_New_5_16_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_23e3b96952-94e0119baa-75578181"">reports New York Post</a>.', 'The Kidz Give Back Foundation hosted an event at PS 242 where students made and dressed stuffed animals to donate to the Children\'s Aid Society. <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160505/west-harlem/harlem-students-stuff-with-love-at-charity-event"">DNAinfo reports</a>.', 'After two years, the clocks and speakers at PS 242 are finally working again.

Our child’s overall experience was engaging and positive---particularly in the classroom. The school environment seemed to be safe, colorful, orderly and relatively clean.\n\nNonetheless, due to poor leadership, the overall school culture left much to be desired.\n\nPROS: \n\nThis might be the place for your child if you can settle for and want:\n\n...to see many teachers and office, nursing, and support staff seemingly take pride in all that they do to nurture students and interact positively with parents.  Many appear to enjoy working with the children and take seriously their job of helping students learn in a safe environment;\n\n... to see the same group of adults appear happy to take on the challenge of contributing positively to the lives of students and their families; and,\n \n... to give your child  a chance to benefit from a well presented magnet themed program.  However, as I will explain below, family\nengagement and parental voice within this program is not encouraged so it may be difficult to identify these benefits. \n\nApparently this problem is not new to YDMA. \n\nSee page 5: http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2011-12/Quality_Review_2012_M242.pdf\n\n CONS:\n\n This might NOT be the place for your family if you aim to experience....\n\n...an administration driven environment aimed at preparing students to achieve far beyond DOE standards. One that encourages students to aspire to become college and career ready global competitors from day one;\n\n...a proactive administration led staff that emphasizes a welcoming attitude towards receiving parent feedback, with a goal towards encouraging student achievement for all students; \n\n...an overtly accessible and responsive administration that encourages steady dialogue amongst all adults on a routine basis. For example: instead of waiting to have issues addressed at parent/teacher conferences, why not send out regular student progress/performance\nreports?;\n\n......a place where it is clear that punctuality across the board (and from top to bottom) matters; \n\n…..a place where the school's dress code, and student preparedness for all tasks and assignments is encouraged; \n\n.....an overall sense of transparency.  For example: in the areas\nof staff retention, professional development, family outreach, and community building so that all adults who invest their energy in the students can have a highly effective impact on them for the long haul; \n\nThis might also NOT be the school for your family if you want to experience... \n\n....an administration that routinely demonstrates that the school is a part of the local community and authentically embraces your child or children as their own without appearing arms-folded defensive and annoyed;\n\n ....a family-type culture regularly encouraged within the school by the administration between all staff members, students, and their loved ones. A culture that is not only aimed at supporting the teachers, but helping the students excel by endorsing parent/teacher partnerships. For example: parents should be invited to be more engaged by visiting classrooms during instructional time, not only to assess the\nlearning progress of students, but to showcase teaching, activities, and projects; \n\n….routine and accurate written communications that provide parents with reasonable notice and reminders of ALL school related events, half days, closing, etc. For example: updating the school website and sending out bi-weekly e-mails/text messages to parents might make things easier for everyone. This school's practice of disseminating newsletters that contain informative teacher summaries *shortly before* or even *after* key events is counterproductive;  \n\n....an administration that effectively balances school security with maintaining an inclusive atmosphere. One that encourages security agents to be stern, but mindful of the need to treat all parents with respect—especially at the start of a school day.  A friendly attitude would help as well.  I agree with another reviewer (on another\nschool review site) who said that agents (clearly supported by the\nadministration) treat parents like criminals. \n\nTo observe, on a regular basis, the corrections officer-like behavior of the security agents at this school is disheartening to say the least.  Their negative energy is exacerbated prior to school events in the auditorium when parents are first corralled into the cafeteria and then to the very back of the auditorium for the duration of presentations. The administration needs to understand that the message conveyed is: 'you parents are still outsiders even when we let you in'.  The students at this school are not inmates and pick up and drop off/pre-presentation practices should be revamped.  Otherwise, I suspect the avoidable tensions in this small school will persist;\n \nand lastly, this might NOT be the place for your family if you are looking for:\n\n....a wealth of enrichment and/or after school programs to compliment the school's curriculum and mission.  \n\nOnce the school leadership and school culture issues became clear to our family (about 6 weeks in) and many others for that matter, we set our child onto a path out of this school and toward a number of other traditional public and public charter schools.  Ones that promote parent/teacher partnerships, and excellence across the board.""]"

I was an 8th grader at M.S.256 at the time Ms. Brecher was a teacher there and let me tell you that she always ran the extra mile to help all of her students. I totally disagree with your statement, ""mr. mac the 8th grade ela teacher is always calling parents for the stupidest things."" This isn\'t true at all, I always attended to his classes and whenever he called someone\'s parent(s) there was a valid reason for it. How would you feel Mr. or Mrs. ""8th grader at ms 256"" if you were a teacher and your student were throwing books and other objects that could hurt others? What would you do other than let their parents know? I agree that when Mr. Perl was the principal the school had more trips, however that was do to the effort of many teacher such as Mr. Patterson, Ms. Walsh, Ms. Soto and many more. I think that the reason why we had nearly no trips was because some classmate couldn\'t behave like human beens.

How can you teach a class when your voice can\'t be heard do to the fact that ""some"" students couldn\'t be quiet the whole class period day after day? Teachers can only do so much and It falls to the principal to do the rest and clearly she didn\'t do anything effective! With this in mind we shouldn\'t be pointing fingers, instead we should be looking for the answer to fix these issues going on in the school.', 'Dear 8th Grader - you make some very valid points.  Yes - teachers can only do so much.  In many ways, the same is true for the principal as well.  A principal (or assistant principal) can\'t teach all the classes for the teacher that is struggling.  Administrators can\'t write all the lessons and hold every individual student accountable for everything he or she does each period.  If the principal could do all this, then there\'d be no need for teachers!  The principal does need to support and help teachers, do his or her best to make them better, and hold them accountable if they never show improvement.  You are 100% right, a class cannot be taught if students are unwilling to listen and focus.  The same is true for a teacher who is given strategies to use to help get the class to listen, but ignores them because he or she ""knows better.""  In an effective school, the teachers and the principal work together to solve problems and support one another.  Sadly, regardless of who has been the prinicpal at MS 256 over the last few years, this has not been the case.  This isn\'t to say the principals didn\'t try - I am sure they did, but the results weren\'t what they could have been,  You are correct that improvement should not be about pointing fingers, it should be about working together.  No one wants to fail.  I hope MS 256 is able to do this going forward.', 'I absolutely agree with your statement, ""The same is true for a teacher who is given strategies to use to help get the class to listen, but ignores them because he or she ""knows better.""""

I am Michele Sweeting-DeCaro, and my son has been at CAS for two years now. My husband and I love the school, but our prince loves it more! His first year was a bit tough as it was an adjustment, but with the support of his teachers, administrators, and some classmates, he was determined to make it work--and he has. One of the many highlights of CAS is the extraordinary teachers who are educated and dedicated in their craft to pull the best out of their students. Furthermore, the teachers are no-nonsense when it comes to behavior. As my husband and I are graduate school and college professors, respectively, we take academics and behavior seriously. Principal Sullivan and V. Principal Sinnott are always available to speak with parents, and the entire CAS team cares about the whole child. Our son is thriving at CAS, and I would say one main reason is that the teachers allow students to do extra work during lunchtime; they allow them to make corrections on tests and overall give the budding scholars chances to move on to victory. I would be remiss if I did not share about the wonderful work of the CAS speech teacher, Mr. Goldman. Our son receives speech therapy from Mr. Goldman and between Mr. Goldman\'s strategies and our son\'s determination, his speech has improved dramatically; so much so that he spoke to his classmates--openly--about stuttering and how it makes him feel and what they can do to help him. Our son received a standing ovation by his peers that day, and this is to the credit of Mr. Goldman. I can continue to share about CAS from the academics to the advisory to the after-school programs, CAS is a gem of a school. As an SLT member, what we NEED is parent involvement. Studies show, ""A parent\'s interest in and encouragement of their child\'s education can affect the child\'s attitude towards school, classroom conduct, self-esteem, absenteeism, and motivation. Parents should stay involved in their children\'s education from preschool through to high school (Strategix.com, para1, 2016).

She didn't want to miss a day. This is the first time I have not received text after text. When they called I was more than happy to help.  By keeping her on task. The staff are very helpful in letting me know about her grades and what she needed to do to get back on track. We  did it. All parents need to do is go to the meetings be there and here what's going on. Don't fight against the staff. They're there to help. I would highly recommend CAS. The main reason is SMALL. Individual help.  There's so many reasons I love the school . I can't go into them now. Don't count CAS out.   I love the Principal and office staff.    Thank you for all the help wity daughter she came out of her shell,reating imporved, math improved.ELA improved Thanks guys."", ""I am Richard Namisano and my son is in the 6th grade. CAS is very good school for a middle school student, because it is small area  on two flows.  The Principal is all over the place monitoring how business is being conducted. He interacts with staff, students and parents with much ease.     \nMy son came to CAS strong in Math and Science but weak in reading and ELA. During the end of the first quarter,  I sat down with the advisory staff and my son. We established his weaknesses and recommended interventions and we were all on the same page. The end of the second quarter, my son won the spelling bee. I got a call from the school phone at around 11.30am. The first instinct was, is there a problem with my son? Oh, it was my son so excited and couldn't wait till evening. He was gasping with joy and as he had  promised, he also made it to the upper principal's honor roll. His ELA and reading level is above the set goal. All this is possible because the administration is fully involved and the teachers are awesome,  helpful and caring. I can't wait to bring my daughter to CAS. Also there are good extra curricula activities, Goddard Beacon downstairs has great programs nurturing and enhancing my son's love for school and CAS in particular. Fellow parents, get involved  and you won't regret a bit . Good job Community Action School."", ""Hi my name is Heather and I am a first year parent at CAS. My son is a 6th grader and we couldn't be happier with how he is doing. Last year was a struggle for him so I was nervous about him starting middle school. CAS has exceeded all of our expectations and it is only the first day of February. My son is happy to go to school in the morning. His teachers are kind and make sure he is working to his full potential and the administration is organized and helpful. We love that the school is on two floors and isn't big and overwhelming for him. This is the first year that my son has taken ownership of his academics and pushes himself to be better. I attribute this to CAS because they have given him the tools to succeed and feel good about himself. My son truly enjoys the curriculum and all that the school has to offer."", 'Hey. My name is Brianne Melendez and I go to Manhattan Business Academy. My 3 years at CAS taught me a lot. My parents and I trusted and loved CAS we decided to send my brother here. At CAS I learned that if you put in work it will pay off. I started out as shy and quiet with bad grades, but with my teachers help I turned failing grades into high honor roll grades. CAS is a great school to go to if you want your child to be encouraged to do try their best in everything they do and succeed.', 'Thank you for your input! Let us know how it goes for your brother.', 'Hi! My name is Suzy Mondesir and this is my third year in Community Action School but I feel like I have been here longer. My older brothers were also in CAS and they thought it was one of the best schools they have been too. CAS has helped me to grow and mature. From the sixth grade being a shy girl and having not the best grades. To being a eighth grader in honor roll. In CAS teachers are always pushing you to do your very best. They take time out of their lunch to stay and help students. Throughout the years I have been at CAS, I learned about the friendly community it can be. Students are always supportive of each other and helping out their peers. At CAS you will have the time of your life by going on fun trips, cool activities in class, fascinating assemblies, and spirit week. Community Action School is a great school and I urge parents to sign their kids up or put it as their first.', ""My name is Jaeseo Shin and I go to Beacon High school and my three years at Community Action School was pretty okay. One thing i'll tresure the most for rest of my life is having the privilege of  being in Mr.Dewolf's class for two years. He was and still is a Social Studies teacher and he taught me so much about not just history but about life. I would seriously come to Community Action School just to be in his class because honestly he has helped me out with thousands of things and it's just unbeliveable of the numberof things he has taught me. One of the thing with CAS is it's not a huge school so it's really easy to bond with a teacher which I really liked. There are other great teachers too! To be honest with all you parents reading this, it's not really which middle school your child goes to, it's wheater he or she will go to school and is ready to learn and takes middle school seriously."", 'The parent coordinator is the point person for families at city schools.

She loves every student at CAS and only wants the very best for them. She is usually at the school well after the students have gone home, working to make CAS the very best school it can be. She responds to parents email immediately, most of the time outside of school hours. I found her not only to be a lovely person, but the most dedicated and responsive parent coordination I have ever encountered. If it\'s important to you to have someone who cares about your child as an individual and who responds to your questions or concerns within minutes, I urge you to put CAS on your application. There are many good things about CAS, but having Karla there as an advocate and ""point person"" is the very best.', 'Community Action is a great school. I urge parents to sign their children up for this school. My time at this school has been pleasant. Teachers would offer extra help and would gladly let students stay up for lunch or after school to help them. The faculty respects each and every student and their families. If there were any conflicts happening between students, Mr. Curry(the principal) and Mr. Sullivan would quickly and efficiently resolve it so that the education and well being of the students is not disturbed by any dispute. Teachers challenge their students to begin to prepare them for High School. Speaking of High School, this school offers many resources for parents and students to help apply to High School. The guidance counselor, Ms.Tejeda, will always be there to help with the application as well as answer questions. There are also many clubs that students could sign up for such as soccer, visual arts, baseball, chorus, etc. The school is kept very clean and neat. For parents concerned about safety, you have nothing to worry about. When students are dismissed, teachers, Mr. Sullivan and Mr.Curry stand outside to watch over them. Based on this, I highly recommend this school.', ""I am super proud that my daughter had the opportunity to spend 3 years at Community Action School.\n\nOur family was in a series of transitions through her tenure there, and at every stage of her education, the staff and administrators reached out and provided reserouces for every eventuality and circumstance!!!\n\nI want to specifically acknowledge Mrs. Karla Fittipaldi for EVERY SINGLE THING she did for my daughter!\n\nOur family couldn't have gotten through the last few years without her non-judgmental support.\n\nI also want Name Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Galbo, Ms. McAuliffe, Ms. Tejeda, Ms. Ryerson, ans all the other teachers, that made her time there wonderful.\n\nI highly recommend this school!!!"", 'We have been to New York for three months and are now going back to Denmark. Among many other possibilities we chose Community Action School - and we have not been disappointed. We were received very professionally and  the school has been just perfect for our 12 year old daughter. The leadership is very professional and kind, and cares about every child. The teachers are good and our daughter has been challenged in a good way. The security at the school is very high and professional as the security man says hi to every single child every morning and every evening. Can be highly recommended.', 'I am very impressed with the calibre of teachers at this school.  Many have taken a personal interest in my child and this inspires him to do his best work.

This seems impossible, if not offensive.  This ""take a walk in their shoes"" assumes that effects of slavery was/is just a mindset. This also assumes that there is ""a"" Black American perspective. This implies that if you read enough textbooks, then white people can get it.  It is just not that simple and this assignment does nothing to promote critical thinking about differences and racial justice.

This is district 3! It doesn’t really exist and it isn’t fair to judge a school only by that. My older kids went to much more diverse schools for high school because those are city wide schools. You should look at Mott Hall 2 (which is a great school) if you want diversity here because that is the only school you will find in district 3 with any real diversity and even that school isn’t equally diverse. \nYou need to look at the school as a whole and if it the best learning environment for your child and if you and your child feels as if they will thrive there. The staff is engaged and also very invested in the expeditionary learning style offered here. For my third child, it has been the most interesting and in depth learning any of my children received through middle school. She chose to stay for high school because she believes she will receive everything she needs at WESS. It isn’t trial and error anymore. WESS is the real deal. Of the few kids who applied out last year, all got into great high schools and chose to have a different experience. The majority of students stayed.

The principal, Jessica Jenkins, and all the teachers have exceeded our expectations with their dedication and hard work, and my son is thriving at WESS.  We decided, last year, to ""first choice"" WESS, after listening to Jessica Jenkins give such dynamic presentations at our elementary school, and describe her vision for this much needed new secondary school in District 3.  Although there wasn\'t an actual school to tour yet last year, Jessica won us over with her great track record (building a successful middle school in Staten Island), and her goals for what she wanted to achieve at WESS. \n\nUsing the Expeditionary Learning model, which is basically ""best practices"" for teaching and learning, the students are challenged with exciting lessons, set and strive to achieve clear goals, self assess and revise.  Student-led conferences,  presentations of learning, Crews (advisory groups), expeditions (units of study), using New York City as a Learning Lab, are all a part of Expeditionary Learning.  WESS teachers use Standards-based grading, which describes clear goals, standards, and rubrics, so students can reflect on their work, and possibly revise it.  With this grading system, teachers know which students are meeting the standards and which still need help. WESS students also have great options for electives and after-school activities.\n\nParents of WESS students are encouraged to participate in the school community, if they can.  Some opportunities are being involved in the PA and SLT, being a Crew parent, joining book clubs to learn about the educational philosophy of WESS (EL), etc.\n\nThe school is located in the old Beacon High School building, and has already been spruced up.  The classrooms have been painted, the furniture and computers are brand new, each classroom has a smart board, and the library has brand new books appropriate for 6th-12th grade.  Every student was given a Google Chrome Book to use for school and home work.  There are plans for more improvements to the gym and second floor.  It\'s a warm and inviting environment for all the students. \n\nWe are excited to be an active part of the WESS community, and look forward to see what the next seven years has in store!', ""We've been VERY happy at WESS. It certainly was hard to dive into a school that didn't exist but from the moment we heard Jessica speak at an open house for WESS we were sold and we feel lucky that we can call ourselves the founding class.  Jessica is an incredibly skilled leader, teacher and administrator.  She loves and understands kids.  Upon hearing Jessica's presentation about what was then a soon-to-open new school we had concerns about whether it would all come together and be as good as we had hoped and as Jessica envisioned but we took the leap of faith based on her personality and her success having started another school prior to this one.  We have been given everything we were promised and more.  Jessica's team of teachers and staff are as dedicated as she is.  The Expeditionary Learning model is a fancy term for how all teaching should be done.  Goals are set, kids are taught and challenged, meaningful (but not onerous) homework is assigned and then very specific feedback is given via standards based grading.  Standards based grading is a system whereby feedback is given to students frequently and on all areas of the work they do.  There are many line items where you can glean much information about what your child is doing well with and what they do not understand or perform well in. Work habits are also graded as they should be. The social skills that kids are also learning by being treated so thoughtfully is invaluable.  The kids learn how to speak in front of one another, talk about their work to others, lead their own conferences, present their work.  It is a remarkably comprehensive learning environment and the best part is that the kids seem quite happy, engaged and proud of their school.  A few more details... The school, while in an existing building, is clean and is furnished with new everything - from furniture to books to technology.  It is a bright, inviting place to be.  The after school opportunities are varied and engaging and the school spirit is high.  I'm sure I could go on...."", ""So if you are looking for a downside to West End Secondary School, you won't find me revealing one. We have had children in the NYC public school system for almost 20 years and for the first time in all those years, I can truly say that we have found a school that delivers what they promise and is in alignment with our philosophy when it comes to its approach to learning. You almost would not believe that this is a brand new school. Jessica Jenkins has moved West End Secondary into the District 3 neighborhood as if she has been here for years. She understands the parents' uncertainty and anxieties around placing their children into a school without any track record. She works with us and challenges us to look at education from new perspectives. She also puts the parents at ease by the very fact that she is extremely clear about the what and the hows of Expeditionary Learning and is always taking steps to make sure the parent body understands it as well as she does. Jessica has the experience and the background and a success record to back herself up. Yes, of course there will always be a learning curve with anything new, but Jessica has thought a lot about what this would look like and how she would make it happen and she is committed to her vision. \nThe expeditionary learning model offers the children a structure in which they can self assess, be accountable, and reflect on not only their learning, but on their personal values. The school lives by and instills their own core values into the everyday learning throughout each academic subject. The core values of West End Secondary School are Creativity, Wonder, Compassion, and Resilience. Our children are getting a rigorous and in-depth education through each section of learning, or expeditions as they are called, as well as whole life experience around discovering who they are and how they choose to be in the world. The homework is thoughtful and challenging without being overwhelming and mindless busy work. Even all of the electives and after school activities are engaging and have been well thought out. There are many after school options (ie. track, cross country, soccer, math team, debate team, Wess Players musical theater, music, Green Club, Student Council) and great electives like hip hop/jazz through Alvin Ailey,Take-Two Film Academy where the kids make their own films, jewelry making, orchestra, art and more. Another wonderful aspect of WESS is the advisory, which they call Crew, which most middle schools do not have and not even all high schools have. Crews are small groups of students who stay with one another throughout the middle and high school years who come together with their crew leader 2-3 times per week to discuss various topics. Because they remain in the same group every year, the kids will have an opportunity to bond over time. I look forward to all that WESS has to offer throughout our years there. I always have a lot to say about this wonderful new school that my child is lucky enough to attend.  For a brand new school, WESS has it all going on!""]"

I have gone to Claire many times and have\nalways been able to find support and a solution to whatever challenge my family\nwas facing. I go to Claire with the attitude that we are a team both wanting\nthe best for my child. I go with ideas for solutions and respect. I have\nnoticed that many parents are very demanding and don’t seem to understand that\nthis is not a bespoke education for their child – but a public school. Public\nschools with the type of access that parents at MSC enjoy is rare. It needs to\nbe treated respectfully, along with the teachers and administrators. Be willing\nto work together and see multiple perspectives and many challenges can be\novercome.', 'This comment unfortunately displaces blame and isn’t an accurate statement about what many families experience. We tried to go to Claire, when our child was actually physically harmed and there were clear DOE procedures to follow, and she wasn’t willing to meet let alone collaborate. This isn’t about something small and nitpicking, but about serious safety issues that the DOE later reviewed and agreed had not been addressed by Claire or those under her. If the principal isn’t willing to meet with families regarding very serious things or ensure other administrators follow up appropriately, it says everything about whether smaller issues will be addressed.', 'I agree. I went through months of disorganized mess before I finally threw in the towel and left the school. Parents are willing to cooperate and support but the administration is a mess. The DOE really needs to step in here and get a new administrative staff - principal on down.', 'Claire needs to go. She lets so many crises fester and does not manage them well. She does not even seem to know how to communicate better with parents and teachers despite the many times she has promised to do just that. It breaks my heart to see the difference from a few years ago - everyone was excited to be at the school and now everyone is rolling their eyes and wondering what is happening and what to do next.\nShe cited increased math scores last year which is laughable given the many classrooms with so many issues. The reason the math scores went up  (slightly) is because parents in the school saw what was happening and enrolled their kids in tutoring services. So, sorry Claire, the scores are up but no thanks to you. \nUnless Claire goes, this school will continue to decline. It is already losing so many of the things that made it special. It is clear Claire does not believe in those things: in progressive education, parental involvement, etc. She lets lots of things happen that should not  be happening and would not have been happening a few years ago. It really breaks my heart to see dedicated, active parents leave the school in troves. The DoE needs to find a new principal fast.

My elementary experience was fine, but middle school is extremely disorganized and has little care. I would suggest avoiding this school, but if you did go leave once middle school starts.

All I'll say is i believe it does well with kids with special needs, so that would be the only reason to pick it over other schools. But its not that bad, it's just really weird. This is my last year :)))"", 'Think carefully before enrolling.  School is in chaos now due to principal Claire. Staff and parents want her out. She has little regard for students individual needs.

Who cares if the school doesn't have 12 year old's staying up for two and a half hours every night, just to memorize crap that's probably useless.  MSC is one of the best schools I know.  They teach the kids learning skills, study skills, public speaking, and the teachers are able to actually apply the curriculum to real life.  All the eighth graders go off to some of the best high schools, and yeah, I won't lie, it is hard adjusting to a academically rigorous high school, from such a progressive middle school environment, but everyone is adjusting in their own way with high school, and the adjustment is over by the first semester ends.

The perpetrator had to spend lunch in the office and didn\'t have his parents called.The nurse ""forgot"" to write a slip, but they did call. Without written proof of the incident I couldn\'t get a safety transfer from the DOE. The only other option would have been to file a police report on an 8-year-old. Numerous families have similar stories. \n\nWhen you take the tour, they show you the hydroponic greenhouse. They don\'t show you the library because there isn\'t one. Really useful for the urban children to know hydroponic gardening when they can\'t read. Even worse are the values of parents who raised $1 million for the greenhouse for the school with no library. Think they did add a ""book room,"" but only teachers are allowed and there are no trips to the public library or visits by the bookmobile. Every week I got a lengthy email about ""healthy living.""

Majority of the teachers are extremely unhappy which results in alot of them planning to leave Claire could learn a thing or two about respect she can be a very nasty person. There is no structure, the school is under staffed and the trickle down effect occurs. What i mean by trickle down effect is when you have an administration that is miserable or simply detest the principle it tends to show and the children pick up on that. Alot of the non structure is because of that very thing. Children who have harmed other kids in major ways get ""suspended"" which usually results in said children being chaperoned\u200b around the school by a staff member. Instead of it being a repercussion for their actions it becomes playtime. In what world do people do bad things and get special treatment? All because she does not want the schools reputation to be tarnished? Basic things like respect and communication are severely missing from this mess of a school', 'I agree. This year has been awful', ' I am particularly bothered at the way Claire the principle handles holidays. On this beautiful Valentine\'s Day I put a head band on my daughter with small hearts and during the morning greet she made my child remove her headband. When my daughter asked her why, she said "" you know we don\'t celebrate holidays"".  As a type 1 diabetic, I can\'t give her candy so I give her accessories and headbands.

We are content staying at our current school as it goes to 8th grade, but what caught our eye is the selection criteria/ factors for selection to NEST+m middle school.  Specifically for students from BSI and District 30 (Q300) where the “Performance Indicators” is weighted at 20% whereas at other schools it is less or not a factor at all.  We asked our current elementary school and they had no idea what “Performance Indicators, as assessed by the elementary school” is, nor did they report anything other than: report card grades, attendance and state test scores for admissions.  \n\nDoes anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is?

Is it 20% as well?\n\nWe realize that students from other districts/ schools may be less represented at NEST+m so can understand the need to give different weights and have different criteria to obtain diversity at NEST+m middle school.  At the same time, we feel that parents should be aware of the process/ criteria so they can make informed decisions.  We are simply looking for transparency.

Ask the admissions people at your own school how many students leave after 5th grade? Zero to one probably. To think that middle schools or high schools would not want a high performing student from a G&T program is just nuts. They would have the same or better chances than a student in a lesser performing school. Best to accept your current placement and move on......', 'I would actually think it would do the opposite and raise the chances of a child attending a screened school.', 'We would be interested to hear your logic/ thinking of how the different weighting would raise the chances for a student from BSI/ Q300.  We could be wrong in our thinking, but our belief is that the goal of having different weights for different school districts was to increase the chances for students from City Wide G&T schools and decrease the chances for students from non- G&T schools (it is a zero-sum situation as there are a finite number of seats).  We found it to be too much of a coincidence that they cited ""District 30 / BSI (20K686)""- District 30 is where Q300 resides- they are not even in the same borough.  The only thing they have in common as far as I can see is that they are both City-wide G&T Schools.

Also, have current 8th grade students at Anderson seen ""Performance Indicators"" in their high school offer letter?', ""Each district and even school can decide their own rubric as they like, and those can change as schools participate in DOE diversity initiatives.  So, your original question on whether performance indicators are used in HS admission - the answer is it depends on the school you are applying to. And what is true today can be different tomorrow.  Yes, attending a G&T citywide or an affluent / high performing school will lower the # of open spots available if you apply to a school that includes the performance indicators in rubric.

Kids who don\'t fit those categories are not necessarily helped and encouraged--their parents are reminded that their kid may not be Anderson material and the children may wind up feeling unwelcome and/or having to leave. Consider: at the school graduation ceremony this year, a few of the ""popular"" girls sang a suite of Barry Manilow songs because that happens to be the principal\'s favorite singer.

Choosing our local high-school was a conscious decision for me. My daughter was initially not on board, particularly because she heard from several friends that Wadleigh was not a good school. So you can imagine my surprise when recently my daughter told me how much she ""loves"" Wadleigh. Her enthusiastic outburst in support of her new school came during a discussion we were having about her day. My daughter expressed joy in participating in the day to day activities of the school. She specifically said that the school did not feel so ""heavy handed"" (her words not mine) in their management of student issues. The schools uses a ""pedagogy of love"" as their management theory, and truly for my daughter she feels loved while in the building. My daughter is also part of the vocal group at Wadleigh, she consistently speaks positively about the vocal teacher and all that she is learning about music. In her first year, she has already auditioned and earned a part in the schools main performance. We could not imagine such an opportunity at larger performing arts high schools. \n\n\n\nWhile I am pleased that my daughter is enjoying this experience as a student, as an educator I am ever watchful of the quality of academic work she is receiving. It appears that thus far there has been a great bit of review of her eighth grade year. I am impressed however with the encouragement students receive to complete Regents requirements in the 9th and 10th grade, so that they can focus on taking AP courses in their 11th and 12th year. There is a great deal of discussion about college going and already parents have been invited to a college workshop so that we can began supporting our students with the college going process. This definitely has pleased the educator in me. \n\n\n\nI have not had great interaction with teachers, but from my frequent visits to the school it appears as if the teachers are dedicated to their craft and their students. I have been in meetings with the Principal and her desire for excellence in every aspect of the school is appreciated by parents like me who want a high-quality high school opportunity for their child. I appreciate the love and passion she appears to bring to the work. I like that she knows her students and appears to be engaged with them in ways that I have not previously seen. \n\n\n\nIf you are a parent who is looking for a 9th grade experience for your child, and he or she is interested in a performing arts school, I truly hope that you will consider granting Wadleigh the opportunity to provide you with a tour.
