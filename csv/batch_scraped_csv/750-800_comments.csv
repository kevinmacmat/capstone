-Children are yelled at during lunch and recess and not allowed to properly socialize and be kids (sit for 7 hours straight)

-Bullying is prevalent and not documented or relayed to parents

-Very very average school - nothing ""stands out"" about this place

-Principal being nice to parents is not enough although she is a MUCH needed change from Olivella - I would suggest there be monthly townhalls with parents so we can voice our concerns and administration would hear the goods and bads

-PTA woman is a complete B. They only look after their kids and God only knows how the money for PTA is being managed because they raise ALOT of money through selling ice cream EVERY DAY to kids at lunch for $2 a piece although I'm told by my child that the three musketeers aka PTA people's kids don't have to pay as they are given free ice cream by their parents - nice!

-Ridgewood is becoming a gentrified neighborhood; I wonder how this school will keep up now that the wealthy yuppies are coming in with their kids

-Curriculum is subpar - students are expected to perform at a certain level but it seems that administration is likely not giving the teachers the proper additional training but mostly not giving enough support to allow teachers bandwidth to produce great results in their students. Their daily class schedules need to have more breaks in order to give both students and teachers a break. Five minutes here and there would make a huge difference for everyone!

-BEHIND TECHNOLOGICALLY! Why can't the monthly calendar be emailed to parents...or even better...maintain a website!!!!! THEIR COMPUTER TEACHER MS. WAGNER IS PART OF DISTRICT 24...what a shameful thing...and they do not have a functioning up to date website where parents can go.

24Q071,concerned parent,queens,Elementary,640,"They have gym class in the cafeteria. Now there is a new principal. SOTO.But the issues remain with the lunch aides and bullying in the boy's bathroom during lunch time.  My child;s class has 28 kids, but is doing well b/c I go over his homework and  make sure he is reading,. Like with any school, the parent must be involved, advocate and have good communication with the teachers and administration. Any issue that is deemed unacceptable  by you as a parent should be in writing and not just complaining to other parents. (That does nothing,) That way they know the problem is serious and there is a paper trail.  They will still try to give excuses but it is important to get a solution to the problem.  Follow up and have good communication with your child and find out if there were changes made. If not, call district and voice your concerns and find out what is supposed to be the proper procedures.
My problems was the teacher was absent and the subs did not teach proper lessons for approx. a month. My issue was that my child was not taught any lessons NOT the quality of the sub.( The school have a common core curriculum, so just get the proper folder and ask the same grade teachers what lesson they are up to and give a review and continue the lesson.Also ask the kids, they know where they were in a lesson, they are smart enough, So there is no excuse as to the subs had no lessons or the teacher left no lesson) Soto just kept focusing on the quality of the subs even though I repeatedly told her that wasn't the issue, it was no lessons were taught.  
 What upset me is that the asst. principals and principal ""didnot know"" the children weren't taught any lessons??and kept trying to deflect the issue. It's their jobs and responsibilities...( PLEASE parents aren't stupid)  but when I called district, I found out that the school administrators (principal, AP) are to monitor the sub and if they cannot teach a lesson, administration is supposed to help them. So the school can ask District  to get guidance, if ""they didn't know."" (Same problems and excuses, just different principal) 


My suggestion is be involved in your child's learning, ask what they learned in school today, check their homework, and ask the teachers or write a note with any questions you may have about what is being taught. (COMMON CORE is different than what we were taught in school) Know what is a 1  score answer and a 4 score answer. 
Don't complain to other parents but speak to the teacher or send a note with your child to let the principal know or send email. 

This way you are not surprised if your child did not do well or that nothing has been done about the issues at hand.


On a positive note, Soto has made improvements
All children are dismissed in a playground not in the street. 
Requiring the AP's to be present during lunch time.(I'll ask my child if it has helped and is a permanent fix or temporary one) Ms.Maria is now not being mean and spiteful esp to boys. (I follow up with my child)
Changing the procedure for lateness. 
Have more positive family nights.

Also Ms. Glowgower (sp), science teacher is very strict, no excuses but that applies to every kid but she is an excellent science teacher. My kid got a 2 b/c he forgot to do his homework but that teaches him responsibility and also I just keep on top of him, asking if there is homework,or a test. But  Ms.Glowgower (sp?) lessons  will prepare your child for the State Science test. Just review all what they learned in her class. 
  
But changes happened  with parent involvement and sometimes calling district to find out what is proper procedure. Don't be afraid to call District to ask questions,(whatever is said is confidential) or read up on  DOE regulations, so your child is safe and educated during school.  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS, if the information the school tells (from teachers, AP,principal guidance counselor ) doesn't feel right to you, call district and find out the right information or check the DOE website. Believe me I was second guessing myself and was afraid to speak out in case my child got backlash but it never did and changes were made.

I feel that in 5th grade they prepared us for middle school by giving us different classes, and for the smart kids, they taught us a lot of 6th grade material. This made me ahead of most people in my class. Because of what they taught me in elementary school, I was able to enter the Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the gifted and talented. A lot of the teachers that I had were nice and taught us a lot, like Mr. Fraboni, Ms. Brown, Ms. Schuff, and many other teachers that I had. One teacher I had who shall remain nameless, who was a science teacher in 4th and 5th grade, gave me a 2 for being absent for 5 days. She also gave one of my friends a 1 for being absent for a few days. In parent teacher conference, she told my friend and I that we received these grades for being absent and that we really should have gotten a 4. Another problem was that they told us for years that they were going to fix the playground and they finished it the year I was leaving the school. Another huge problem were the lunch aids. I will never forget the time that I whispered three words and they made me sit at the back table for a week. While they were escorting me, one of them had a smile on their face, like they enjoyed it. There were numerous occasions where we were not allowed to go outside on a sunny day because they felt like it. Half of the time we were not allowed to speak.

24Q071,other,queens,Elementary,640,"<p>I think this school has alot of good things about it. The teachers for the most part want to help the students and demonstrate patience with them. That being said, the lunchaids are and have been a problem that hasn't been taken care of for the longest time. I don't know why anyone hasn't spoken out on the way they treat the students but it seems as if these aids cannot get fired no matter what they do. As a former student in the 90s where some of the aids of today are still there, the same type of things were happening. Everything is about control for them. I can't believe that talking isn't allowed in a lunchroom. They may have the principal convinced and everyone else that things of that sort don't occur by putting up a nice front when the observers come around but I've seen it with my own eyes plenty and I am sick of it already. Something needs to be done about these aids. If the school wants to contact me, I can even provide names of specific ones to further prove my point.</p>",4,0,0,2010-08-24T18:47:12,1.0,0.16899999999999998,0.20199999999999999,0.025,0.772,0.095,0.625,0.045,0.009000000000000001,0.542,0.348,0.265

24Q073,Nica,queens,Middle,1971,"What you all are saying is half true half false. I.S.73 is a crowded school in Maspeth with an academy at each floor which does not include the basement (Bradbury, Newbury, Pulitzer and Carnegie) There are SP classes in each grade and academy. Many teachers are nice and caring but there are some that are very strict and if you do not pay attention to their class, you may have detention. But most of the troublemakers are being dealt by the deans. Warning you, they are WAY strict than the teachers. Also if you are a 8th Grade student in SP class, some of the teachers you may have expects you to do well in class since they will treat you like high school students.

I am, as of right now, a 8th grader in I.S.73 in Pulitzer Academy in SP. I have great friends. In 6th grade I transferred to this school because my old school was far away from my home. I met great friends and many classmates from my elementary school. I had a lovely homeroom and science teacher, a great ELA teacher, and two funny math and science teachers. There are two art classes and the music and drama classes are in the basement. There are two gyms-one on the 3rd floor (for girls) and one on the 4th floor (for boys). On warm days our gym teacher may let us play in the school yard. During lunch the dean of our academy keeps the students in discipline and we take turns to go outside into the school yard (boys one day, girls the next day) The school yard is big but can get crowded by the students. Last but not least, on one day of every school week our academy goes to the auditorium and listens to the assistant principal, dean or guidance counselor tell us news about our school. If they are busy, then we the students are suppose to work on our schoolwork or homework in silence. If any disruption were made by any student, the dean will pull him or her out and gives him or her detention. 

After school, there will be Maspeth Town Hall where students get to have fun activities in the cafeteria and on the school yard. Also students participate in certain days where we show school spirits. Each year there will be dances students can participate and a DJ to perform. This is by the amount of money the school earns from us buying things from the Candy Sale.

This is what I know and my opinion of this school is fantastic.

We are limited to language in this school, so you will only have spanish as a language class. Only SP classes get spanish, I'm pretty sure of this. This school is crowded during passing time, and students will shove and push. There are abundant amount of kids that don't care for their grades so much, but the SP and Honor kids come in to be exceptionals. Just don't get into the wrong crowd of people and you will be fine.

24Q077,Chen Hyung,queens,Middle,928,"If you're Asian and your face shows it, be prepared to experience some bullying and harassment by your peers. This school has a large Hispanic population, the majority of whom are lacking behind in their academics. It's always the Asians who get picked on by their race. When I was in 6th grade, some of the 8th graders would shout at me, ""Chino!"" even though I was not Chinese. The majority of the students are ignorant. The only place where you'll find comfort and security is if you're in the SP Honors, which is much better than Honors class. The Honors class has some rowdy kids, so make sure your child gets outstanding grade so that he/she can be in SP Honors. No one actually bullied me about my race in SP Honors, they teased me about it sometimes, but in a playful manner which I excused. I've been in SP Honors for all throughout 6th, 7th, and 8th grade and never once have I seen a fight between members in my class. 6th and 7th grade SP Honors class has some kids who don't belong there, but by 8th grade, everything will be within their place. 

How your child turns out in this school depends on your child. If he/she hangs out with the bad crowd (which is the majority of this school), then he/she WILL turn out bad. However, if your child hangs out with the good students, then he/she will become good. I'm not promoting the SP Honors class, but it's the only class in this school that has the most positive environment, and all the brilliant kids go there. 

Your child might get placed in a ""normal"" class, which is full of bad kids, but if your child maintains an excellent grade all throughout that year and hangs out with positive people, then next year, he/she will be in SP Honors. That's what happened to one of my friends, Liz. She was placed in a bad class, but she knew what was right and wrong, and hanged out with the nice, well-mannered kids in that class (only about 2 kids, but hey, better than none). She was the smartest in that class (what do you expect- that class's full of bad, I-don't-care-about-school kids) and next year, she got placed in the SP Honors. Once she got placed in that class, Liz wasn't the smartest, since everyone was bright, but she did try her best and maintained her grades above 90%. When I asked Liz if she likes this class, she said, ""Obviously. Better than my old class."" 

As a final note, I would strongly recommend your kids to prepare for high school in 7th grade. If you want your kids to go to a specialized school (research about high schools and ask someone who's a freshman for their high school directory book that was given to them in 8th grade), send them to prep courses in the summer after 7th grade ends, so that when 8th grade starts, your child will be ready to ace that SHSAT (Specialized High School Admission Test) exam, which is held in October- 2 months after 8th grade starts. 

This school is wonderful as long as your child has the right friends, is in SP Honors- they have teachers who are fair, challenge you, and actually teach you something- and does not get influenced by the bad kids. I'm currently in 8th grade (and in SP Honors), and I'm happy with my friends and class. I may get not-so-outstanding grades in science- almost everyone in my class agrees that it's the hardest class out of all the other classes- but I love the challenge, and I learn a lot from my mistakes. 

Being in SP Honors in 8th grade is a wonderful thing because you don't have to take the 8th grade NYC State Exams. Instead, you prepare for the 8th grade Regents exam for math and science. If you pass the Regents exam, you can skip some classes in high school, and take harder class (AP classes), which will allow you to skip some classes in college, which means less money to pay. 

As for the deans and principle, they do their best to take care of this school. I'm sure a lot had changed about the deans and the principal since four/ten years ago. They listen to both sides of the student during a fight/event, ask the witnesses, and make a proper decision. I've been to the deans at least once per each grade to report people who've bullied me, and I've to say, I'm satisfied with the outcome. Usually, they didn't punish the bullies- they just made them apologize to me. But after that, the bullies never bullied me again. 

In conclusion, I.S.77 is a great school- as long as your child hangs out with the right crowd, gets good grades, and is in SP Honors. I've matured a lot from the bullying I received by people in other classes, as well as some other issues, and I'm grateful for my experience in this school.

The work is way to easy and the teachers don't even explain enough if you ask them a question. I wouldn't reccomend going here if you want a school for smart students. Bullying is just a normal day in this school. The deans are NOT helpful at all. If you get in trouble and you get sent to the dean's they just take the side of the majority population. You could argue all you want and be right about it but they don't want to hear it. ALOT of kids cut in my class and just really don't care about work. The average grades in my class are a 65-70%.

24Q093,Jim,queens,Middle,1124,"I feel compelled to respond to the last comment.  I understand the adolescent mindset.  I have been teaching at this school for a long time.  As you know, adolescents think that the world revolves around them.  This is not their fault, but apart of the brain development process. 

 This particular student was bitter because his perception.  Perception is not always reality.  For instance, he claimed he was being picked on and nothing was done about it, yet he praised the Dean, Ms. Valentin, using the adjective “amazing”.  I know all of his teachers and they would have not tolerated this name calling.  Ms. Valentin would have dealt with any bullies.  We try our best to be a bully free zone.  Unfortunately, this student assumed that teachers knew what was going on.  This has to do with the adolescent mind set (the world revolves around them).  Teachers have hundreds of students and try their best to deal with every situation that arises while engaging students in interesting lessons.  

As for his comment about “Horrible” teachers, he seems to focus on the negative.  There are no reasons mentioned as to why they were horrible.  I know many of his teachers and they all talked highly about him.  His contributions to discussions was a major reason why.  He asked very good high level question and was always engaged. 

As for the assistant principle, she was stern, which is often looked down upon these days.  I will stick up for her in that she always maintained order while giving breathing space to students to allow for creativity.  The principle was busy planning activities, teaching classes, and working with teachers to improve their skill set.  

The after-school program happens to be affiliated with the school. They do a great job in engaging students in the arts, sports, and video games. 

It is sad that this experience has led him to want to tarnish the reputation of the school. I only hope the best for this student and that he realizes the good as well as the bad.  When you read a negative comment by a former student or former parent, think objectively and realize that their perception isn’t always reality.",0,0,0,2015-11-11T03:15:01,0.5,0.136,0.218,0.061,0.6759999999999999,0.125,0.652,0.076,0.026000000000000002,0.7190000000000001,0.17300000000000001,0.16399999999999998

He simply carries on in Foley's clown shoe footsteps, bullying teachers and making sure that there are no veteran experienced teachers in the school. That's what leads to the massive discipline problems this school has.

24Q119,yeooo,queens,K-8,1275,"I'm a Gifted And Talented 7th grader currently attending I.S.119 and in this short time, I’ve seen growth in multiple aspects, as have my parents and teachers. At school, I've mastered the material that needs to be learned and the teachers here helped me see the importance in all the efforts I've put into my education, and with this comes time management. After seeing all the kids in my class who've been able to reach the same goal as mine, it’s impossible not to be inspired. The teachers don’t just teach you the material, they motivate you. Every teacher works extra hard to help you understand everything you need to and more. They go above and beyond to prepare us. By doing so, they are able to help you toward gaining a spot in your dream school,and attaining high scores. When enrolled in this class, you could see all the work they've put into you, and in the end, you can see how all the efforts have been worth it. The environment overall is pretty nice, compared to other schools in the district. The kids, for the most part, are very friendly and well mannered, you just have to know what kind of people you should hang out with, as the same goes for really, any school to be honest. The teachers, as I've mentioned before, are absolutely outstanding at doing their job. I especially recommend Ms. Govier and Ms. Puterbagh for constantly trying to help you improve your math skills and going out of their way to assist you, Mr.Wansor and Ms.Matundan, for being really understanding and accommodating whenever a student needs some extra tutoring or help (they have afterschool programs), Ms.Marino, who not only I love as an ELA teacher, but came to know as a best friend or so you could say (She has tattoos, a rad taste in music and fashion, has awesome trapeze skills, and is SUPER sarcastic and funny-Who wouldn't like her?) , Mr.Teehan, for always trying to come up with creative and fun ways to learn History, Ms.Grady for being very encouraging when it comes to working on your ELA skills, Mr.Dudin for having a sense of humor and simply existing and being there to teach us Robotics, Ms.Wei, Ms. Deangelis, and. King Memos. The faculty and staff are awesome too. For example, our principal, Dr.Feagan is always coming up with ways to make our school a better place. Recently, she's been promoting the idea of students making a change. So, from bake sales, to fundraisers, to simple donations or charity drives, she permits it all and we raise about an average about $250 for each. My morning meeting class (Homeroom) arranged a program where we collect recyclable bottles and turn them in for money we can donate to St.Jude's hospital. So far, we have raised about $283 and it's fun and we all enjoy it. So, I guess that concludes my review, I TOTALLY recommend this school for your child. As long as your child doesn't create problems, there shouldn't be one. All I can say is make your own decision and hope for the best :D",0,1,0,2016-05-12T10:41:01,0.75,0.025,0.091,0.015,0.532,0.032,0.391,0.271,0.02,0.295,0.392,0.10099999999999999
24Q119,The Commenter,queens,K-8,1275,"P.S./I.S.119Q  is not the best school, but it is not the worst either. There are some Pros and Cons to going here or sending your child here. 
Pros: 
1.The Gifted and Talented program is a good opportunity to let your gifted child unleash his/her full potential
2.The Teachers are very kind and friendly
3.They still push you to do your best
4.There is a variety of teachers with different nationalities, your student could feel comfortable around
5.The Guidance Counselor is very helpful and reassuring

Cons:
1.The nurse can sometimes be so rude
2.The Students curse a lot and there is a group of 8th Graders who already smoke
3.Some students have VERY unruly behavior
4.Sometimes the Gifted and Talented Students can be very rude to the Gen Ed kids.

It is up to you or your parents if you want to go here but I've shown you the good and bad sides of going to P.S./I.S.119Q.

For the younger grades in which uniform is required, a great majority don't wear their uniforms.  Too many kids cut classes by just hanging out in the hallways or staying in the bathroom.  These children are constantly cursing, whether they're in General Education or Gifted and Talented.  I feel that the school is too separated between the two groups.  Also, there is an extremely large amount of bullying, and it happens everywhere in the school.  The vocal and choral program is terrible.  I was stuck in the program for two years, and the teacher is the worst.  She is unorganized, and never has an actual plan.  There is nothing I've learned in her class that I couldn't learn in five minutes online.  We have seen her cry before several times, and a large majority of the students disrespect her mainly because it is very hard to take her seriously as a teacher.  The shows for these music programs are horrible, and they are worth almost two-thirds of your grade.  I have been in the Gifted and Talented program for 3 years and it's fine, but I really hate the school.  The guidance counselor is horrible at her job, and she clearly shows that she cares more for troublemakers and less for those who are in the Gifted and Talented program.  It seems that to her, we are less of a priority.  So far this year, my friends and I have been pushed out her room and yelled at by her saying she's ""busy"" because we wanted to know whether or not she had applied us for the SHSAT.

I'm the Gifted&Talented program. There is 4 classes of G and T kids in each grade. For all grades they are the classes ending in 1,2,3, or 4. They have separate teachers to teach us for all subjects excluding your choice of talent (Art, Band, or Chorus) and Gym. It's a intense program since you can't slack and get good averages like a 99 in each class. Right now towards the end of the year we still have work and projects due. It is a pretty hard workload and many kids are falling behind. However, the teacher's really care about you so it isn't all that bad. Some teachers may show some bias but if you're a good student it won't matter. We have core classes of math, ELA, social studies, and science. There is literally no bullying in 6th grade G and T. Everyone is everyone else's friend. The deans and principal Dr. Fagan keep things in order. Don't listen to those older comments from 2-5 years ago. Times have changed.

They have high expectations from students in G&T, and it's all about the school work. The class read 'Lord of the Flies' and the writing project, a journal, was very creative. They're given Robotics and Mandarin class once a week. Then they have a choice for Talent-music, chorus or theatre. 

I do agree with previous statement that Winter Concert had poor planning. They should have a separate concert for younger grades, altogether.

24Q239,TheatreGuy109,queens,Elementary,486,"As a teacher at PS 239 I have learned that the presentation of our individual work comes in all imaginative, creative and multi faceted shapes and sizes. I have also become aware that this
is not completely clear to everyone in our school community. A large public performance for the school and our student’s parents is not the only way to showcase a theatrical presentation. We are a multi faceted school and as
professional educators we can make decisions to show how we present our student work to our school community. These presentations can come in many art forms and structures. 

In place of flashy Broadway productions, I chose to focus this year on the artisanal off Broaway approach to theatre. The studio 109 classroom has been transformed into a black box
theater by the theater arts teacher at PS 239 and has been twice evaluated as highly effective during the 2013-2014-school term. Parents are invited to the studio 109 classroom for individual class performances that in the past have left an emotional impact on parents, teachers, students and administrators.

 In addition to these types of presentations, our fourth grade students with the assistance of our third grade students have
recently wrapped a five-month class film project. The project consisted of scripts they wrote, acted, and directed while assisting in all areas of the production of this ten-minute film.  Their work is presented in the schools beautiful state of the art auditorium for the entire school community during carnival day in June. The student created film is the only film running on this day as it repeats every twenty minutes for a full day
schedule for the entire school. The students also get the Oscar treatment as they receive awards for their work. This project and unit has inspired many future artists to pursue an education in media.

24Q239,SciGui78,queens,Elementary,486,"Before one makes strong accusations toward one’s co-workers and administration, one might be best advised to fact check the data. 

The first claim: “that turnover is high because of dissatisfaction with the administration,” contradicts the Inside Schools data- the platform you chose to express your opinion. According to said data, 91% claim that the “principal is
an effective manager,” 12% higher than the city average. 80% of all teachers would recommend PS 239 to other parents. 

You also stated that. “Behavior is an issue... this is a PBIS (Positive Behavioral Incentive School) school which means teachers are only supposed to reward the positive rather than criticize the negative.” 

PS 239 is a Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) school, which does encourage all of us to reinforce positive behaviors. PBIS, as stated in previous meetings, takes the average school 3-5 years to be fully operationalized. Any solid system worth its salt takes time to develop, monitor,
analyze and re-adjust. Regardless, IS data claims that 99% of all teachers believe that “order and discipline are maintained.” 

I find your statement that staff members “don’t trust one another” to be odd and perplexing. Staff who don’t trust one another, don’t spend time with one another outside of school, attend happy hours together, or engage in very fun end-of-the-year parties. WE do all of the above, and WE do it with panache.

Your observation about “lectures” and teachers “instructed not to collaborate” is also contradictory. Lectures were formed in order for horizontal collaboration to take place! Issues of course arise, but lectures are utilized to strengthen
the academic skills of our school’s population. 

I’m open to anyone who wishes to express their opinion, but opinions can not be publicly expressed solely based on trivial observations. One runs the dangerous risk of misleading the
public viewer, purposely or otherwise. When these types of gross misrepresentations are written it seems as though one’s intent is to defame the character of the school; unfortunately all stakeholders suffer from such slander.",35,0,1,2014-05-30T22:25:48,1.0,0.27,0.261,0.08199999999999999,0.079,0.226,0.737,0.14400000000000002,0.012,0.774,0.066,0.20199999999999999

24Q307,Catherine Crifasi,queens,Elementary,899,"Teaching is a rapidly evolving profession.  Teachers are expected to be facilitators who cultivate scholars throughout the day.  Pioneer Academy, PS 307 Q, has experienced many changes during its first five years; some find change difficult while others embrace change.  Consider comparing a new school to a new restaurant, 80% of all restaurants close its doors after its first year.  Failure is not an option at Pioneer Academy as success requires many ingredients.  Pioneer Academy’s doors will open for its sixth year with high expectations for all scholars, parents and staff members. 

Pioneer Academy is unique to District 24 where the staff is diverse supported by a principal who encourages everyone to be risk takers.  Picture this, first and second graders flying to Texas (without their parents) for a chess competition and bringing back trophies. Another facet for success is the open door policy for parents, teachers and scholars allowing Ms. Jackson's vision to be transparent.  Pioneer Academy’s scholars want to learn and smile throughout the day.  Can adjustments be made, yes! But isn’t that what life is about… 

""You Rock!"", ""Go for it!"", ""Thank-you!"", “Work hard-play hard!”, “No worries.” and ""We are here for the scholars."" are the echoes heard throughout the halls of Pioneer Academy by Ms. Jackson.

24Q307,Anonymous,queens,Elementary,899,"As with all schools there are pros and cons. The Pros are the students are incredibly well-behaved, extremely compliant and diligent. There are zero to no behavioral issues. The parents care so much about their child's education so much so that when there are events, ParentTeacher Conferences, cookshop activities, trips, etc there is always a huge turnout. They truly support their child as well as the school. Great resources, clean environment, and even an elevator for staff. Nice neighborhood, safe environment.

The Cons are the work environment and the lack of experience administration in this school has. Much of what they believe is great in theory but not in practice, due to their lack of teaching experiences and experiences as administrators. Much in the first few years, teachers here were steered in wrong directions, intimidated and even spoken to disrespectfully on a continuous basis. There were many teachers that resigned, were de-certified or transferred. Before I had the chance to experience this, one teacher warned me before the 1st day of school to ""Run!"" and ""You don't have to take this!"" Wish I would've listened before.

25Q021,Anonymous,queens,Elementary,1258,"Like all nyc schools, there are good and and bad things. There are some highly effective teachers, and some that should not be teaching at all. Staff in general seem overwhelmed, with large class sizes and not enough effective/relevant professional development for the needs of the school.  Children in special needs classes are not a priority, and treated as though they dont exist. There is a general lack of professionalism from the administration, and with the exception of Mrs. Liatto, it is very evident that the other administrators have had little to no experience teaching in a classroom. This shows in how the school is run. If they had ever taught, they might understand how to better support their teachers and students.  Priorities are not in order, and everything becomes the blame game, rather than putting the childrens needs first.

That was the worst reason to turn a visitor away for most teachers already have plans after school and it's never been said that visitors were not allowed. During my time at that school, during school hours we had a lot of visitors, and they were college students and the such and they were not turned away. Heck, they didn't even have the guest sticker meaning that the security guards let them pass through. I honestly wasted my time waiting outside in the cold for an hour. Tried calling multiple times but each and every call led to a voicemail.

25Q025,JayRey,queens,Middle,1053,"Wow!  I am shocked by the comments below.  I graduated I.S. 25 a long time ago (1992).  I left a Catholic grammar school, for financial reasons, and with the hopes of becoming more well rounded.  It was a success!  At I.S. 25, my fiction writing skills were celebrated as I was encouraged by Mr. I. to continue to work on my novel writing.  I was inspired by Mr. M. to advance in math.  I also was afforded the opportunity to become a ""vocal major"" and participate in a grand performance at Carnegie Hall.  I even used a saw in wood shop to carve my own name plaque.  We never saw my principal either, but as students, we had high expectations and self-motivation.  We all aspired to be greater even though we came from less fortunate homes.  Honestly, after reading the posts below, if I were the principal, I would be in hiding as well!  Where are the kids getting these drugs and are the parents so delusional that they do not notice the behavior of their children drinking and smoking?  It isn't difficult to smell smoke on clothes.  Yes, we had our occasional misbehavior. I even got into my first fight in the I.S. 25 school yard, but because of the dean back at that time, it was my last fight!  He was extremely intimidating.  I hope the community can step up and get some kind of handle on this situation.

We got our kids there, but the college wouldnt let them in because it was scheduled for 10:45. No notice, no update, no email, no call from school. Our children were there from 9:30 WITH NO FACULTY FROM IS 25 UNTIL 9:40 when the first teacher strolled in! When I called the school they had nothing to say.....

My freshmen and sophmore years were just continuing on with some of the bad habits bleeker gave me.

25Q185,alumnus,queens,Middle,1506,"<p>During my 3 years I've made some amazing friends and met a handful of amazing teachers. And as part of the SP program, I had the opportunity to take higher level classes, which helped immensely later on. However, JHS185 is still lacking in some areas.  The Alpha class, it's great if you can get into it, but unfair for everyone else. First of all, I don't see how the school can select 25 kids from a group of hundreds and label them as the best. If I remember correctly, it was based on a writing test. Is that a definite, fair indicator? I believe the school should create different levels for each subject to fit the student. This way it not only better prepares students by mimicking a high school setting, but also expands on the student's specific strengths instead of forcing a set schedule upon them. JHS185 is definitely on a tight budget. If that is the case, why spend it so frivolously? Didn't a certain class win a trip to the movies from a certain teacher?

Unfortunately, no one voice their opinion due to fear of retaliation. During the ten year tenured of this principal, the school has dwindled.  I’m unable to comprehend, why the DOE has not removed this principal from the school. This school has failed the quality review under the present administration. How many more years will DOE allow for our school to fail and be mismanaged?  This school needs someone who has the capacity and ability to provide a comprehensive well balance curriculum.  Students do not have any physical education activities during school hours.  A component that is crucial to the student body.
