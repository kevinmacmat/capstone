07X161,"['I worked at PS 161, and want to direct my comment to prospective teachers thinking about working here.\n\nI see many of the comments here are about disruptive students. I felt that this behavior was about the same as other schools with high economic need. The children are not the problem at this school.\n\nThe biggest issue is administration. The principal is very hands off and lets the APs handle everything, even answering her emails. They are quite disorganized, i.e. sometimes they announce the wrong times for meetings/assemblies, or they say they will provide you some support and then never do it.\n\nWorst of all, one of the APs is a bully who likes to play favorites and abuse her power. Teachers live in fear of getting yelled at and written up for minor incidents. She has a need to control everything: your bulletin boards, your classroom furniture, your lesson plans. UFT knows about this, but she gets away with it because she will argue with everything and twist the contract wording around. She barges in on teachers during their prep/lunch to make them do something. She has even threatened not to recommend tenure for effective-rated teachers. I firmly believe she is the main reason why 161 has high teacher turnover.\n\nAnother consideration for candidates is there are charter schools all around 161, so enrollment is constantly dropping. They have lost a lot of funding and will need to let teachers go (even tenured teachers). So if you get a job here, your job could be gone very quickly.\n\nIf you read through all of this, please consider this information, for your career and your well-being.', 'PS 161 now offers free pre-kindergarten for both 3- and 4-year olds.', 'The dual language program at PS 161 will begin in pre-kindergarten, beginning in 2015.']"

A comment further below stated the changes that they disagree with - I can absolutely say that they are a disgruntled person making waves, because all of those changes were 100% for the better, or at the very least necessary. \n\nThe learning happening in classrooms here isn't just about gathering information, it's about learning where we stand in the world. Every class pushes students to think about what is happening right now in our world, and what sort of impact it has on them and they can have on it. Students and teachers work alongside each other to better understand what is going on, rather than teachers acting like they are all-knowing gifts to the class. There are opportunities for students to push one another, to better work with their community, to design the kind of learning and activities that they care about. But Letters is much more than a school, because the people within it care about more than just curriculum - they care about kids. To hear both students and teachers say that the community feels like a family is a normal occurrence, and every student has adults that they are close with. As each year passes more and more 8th graders choose to stay for four more years, and alumni are seen visiting on a regular basis. \n\nIt's hard to keep this any shorter, because there is literally that much to say about the school and the people within it. There are plenty of amazing schools in NYC, but none like Bronx Letters - because it isn't just a school, it's a home."", ""This school is a really great school! I am a student here and I love it. Tell me how many schools can you text the principal when you have a problem or learn about whats happening at school from instagram or hang out with your English teacher after school to get quiet space for homework or go to Ms. Lidia when you're looking for a job or a study abroad program or sign up for sports or take overnight college trips or join the debate team or go to protests? The school is great and I've been here since middle school so I can tell you how much the staff cares about this school and how hard the principal and assistant principals work to make sure we are getting what we need. The rules are annoying sometimes but they are all pretty normal stuff like uniforms, passes, lateness, attendance, and all that stuff. The deans go hard for the school and yes, sometimes it is really annoying but that's why our results keep going up! The school has changed a lot over the last few years and change is hard. But there is no question if this is a great school and if the staff here cares about us. These are people who call me to wake up for school. These are people who come to your house if you are missing days. I get that some people want a more chill environment but as a student, I prefer a place with high standards that will prepare me for college. This is that school. The staff is fire. The focus is on social justice which means the focus is on us! I am a headed into my senior year and I am a different person because I went here."", 'You know you are at an amazing school when all you can think about is going back to the community during the summer time. I started at BAL just as any first-year teacher starts, timid and in need of support. However, I quickly realized the sort of space I was in and the people I was surrounded by. I found myself working with a team of teachers who were ready and able to help me reflect on my craft (lesson planning, procedures, etc.) while helping me understand how to build relationships with the students. The student-teacher relationships I was able to develop were even further supported by an administration, who worked daily to analyze the culture and ensure the entire community had space to comfortably learn and work..... and this was only the first year. The principal and other leaders are constantly reflecting on the school every year (with heavy input from students and staff) and seamlessly builds supports where they are needed. They have brought on more administrators to support teachers, more counselors to help support students emotionally, more special education teachers to help ensure all students get the education they deserve and more leadership roles for students to ensure they have a strong voice. The two greatest gains have been made in the restorative justice program (half the rate of other NYC schools,) and the thriving sports program (city champs in softball!) All of this (and more) have made this school become a true home to everyone who walks in the doors. Yes, we do face the same challenges as many other schools, but I can confidently stand up to them with the support of absolutely everyone around me on a foundation built by people who care.', ""The Principal is amazing!! he is very helpful when it comes to anything that would better the school and kids. He ensures that restorative justice practices are applied in all we do. I am currently a teacher at BAL and can honestly say it is he best school I have worked at. The scholars best interest are always put first and the staff always comes together to make sure we are providing them with the best opportunities possible. Our scholars are exposed to colleges from grade 6 and have over night and day trips to different colleges throughout the school year. They are taught how to use their voices to make sure they make changes in their communities. Our scholars have gone to DC to states their opinions and have gone to places such as facebook headquarters to attempt to block videos of people fighting. They have taken a stand in so many issues that our nation is going through such as day of silence for those whom don't have a voice and the nationwide walk out that was organized by our own students. \n\nI have never been at a school in which observations are actually a positive experience. Every de-brief is filled with amazing feed back and actual attainable next steps that the Principal Brandon Cardet and the 2 AP's Erin and Amy give you things they have used when they where teachers to help you out. They will also take the time to plan with you if you need help and are the teachers biggest cheerleaders in the classroom. I actually looked forward to my observations because I knew I was going to learn something new in de-brief. They also encourage teachers to apply to leadership positions throughout the school and even if you don't have experience they help you. \n\nThey are also amazing with first year teachers. hey encourage first year teachers and give them the best guidance ever. I never had this guidance when I was a first year teacher so I asked to be put on so I could experience it and I loved it. They give you extra observations and don't expect you to know it all as other schools would. They build you up in the best way and help you find your groove. \n\nThe Principal and the support staff are always out in the hallways during transition and can be seen giving students pep talks when they need it, intervening in issues long before they get out of hand, and implementing rules and regulations of the school in the most honest way. The school has a counselor for every grade which is amazing as the counselors know every student personally. The counselors are committed to make sure the students stay on the right path and when students don't show up do home visits to attempt to figure out the problem. \n\nThe school is a big fighter to get more money for sports in lower income segregated communities like ours. Our students have gone and spoken at many different places to present this case and state how important it is for schools in segregated communities to have access to sports programs. Our female softball team came out number 1 in the city championships this year and this shows how dedicated they where and the staff was to helping them go above and beyond. \n\nThe principal has an open door policy, when he is in his office, and students and staff feel free to always be able to walk in and talk to him if they have an issue. The principal is very transparent to what expectations are for both students and staff and has many ways to help you maintain expectations. \n\nEvery year the school host a benefit to help raise money for events and trips that the DOE doesn't provide funding for such as over night college trips outside of the state. In which students stay in hotels while they tour colleges. Our school also has an exchange program in which our students go for one week to another state to stay at a participating students home and go to school with them. Then the following year that students comes to the bronx and attends BAL. \n\nThe staff is mixed with different cultures and ages of people whom have the best interest of the students in mind always. They students can be seen asking for hugs and asking staff to help them with personal issues since they feel such a strong connection with us. We are def one big family. \n\nOne amazing difference at this school is that they understand that you are human and have families. When I had to leave when my son got sick in school, I found that I was giving smiles by the administration to go and take care of him instead of mean stares. \n\nOne of the AP's, Erin Garry, even set up an additional English regents prep course at the end of the year in which I had the privilege to help her teach. She would still do her AP job but also would lesson plan for over a month to make sure our students were getting additional help. \n\nBrandon is big on us also looking at ourselves and doing work on ourselves that don't have to do with teaching. During our PD's we did cultural work to notice our own biases and experiences with discrimination and racism so that we may better serve our students. We as a staff were able to bond and get to know each other as more than just co-workers but as individuals. This gave us an upper hand since we were able to tackle issues together instead of separately. \n\nI would recommend this school to anyone. It is lots of work since you are always working on yourself and your students but it is an amazing experience. I have grown as a teacher more in this school that all my years of teaching combined."", 'Principal Brandon Cardet-Hernandez is a politician and does not leave Instagram or his office. He is not a Principal.

This was highlighted by the annual fundraisers where we were invited to prance around or stand on stage as if on an auction block.

The students have no respect for teachers or administration, there are multiple fights every day, and children are constantly wandering the halls cutting class. Bullying is a very prevalent thing at this school despite all of the anti-bullying posters hanging around the building. Students frequently use inappropriate language in class and in the halls, disrupt class, come to class unprepared, and feel that they can do whatever they want whenever they want. 131\'s motto of being ""prepared, punctual, and polite"" is an empty alliteration as most students are never prepared or polite. However, they do show up to class on time, for the most part, unless they are part of the ""Hallwalkers."" The school has no Dean, and no form of consequences for student misbehavior other than calling their parents.\n\nThe principal is well aware of the disciplinary problems at the school but chooses to blame teachers for poor classroom management. The principal has little control over the students so she exerts her power over the teachers and other staff in abusive and bullying ways.

The students run the school.  There are no consequences for students, only teachers.  Her mouth is disgusting.  She curses during staff meetings and she curses at the students.  She gets away with murder in 131 and the school is a hole in the wall. TOXIC is a word all too familiar with those at 131.  The environment is toxic.

When you do find it, please let me know because I want to go work for them.  Respect is something that is given to others in order to be received back and Authority is taught in order to obtain control of your work environment.  In a Title I school we should expect to find students that are often unprepared.  It is our responsibilities as teachers, administrators & Parents Associations to find help and/or provide for these students.  When as a teacher, you don't make it your business to find out why these children are not prepared, then that only says one thing to me & that is; that you are just an employee & not a teacher.  In many cases, families may not have the means to provide their children with the supplies, uniforms, etc.  The school's Parent Association is willing to help.  The Principal is a very well respected individual by students, parents and all.  If she blames a teacher for lack of discipline in their classrooms is because she has the necessary proof to back her decisions.  No discipline in the classrooms is due to lack of teachers authority, which translate to no instructional time for our children.  So,  we that said; I am personally grateful  that our Principal chooses instruction over instructors that are obviously only looking at the clock to go out to eat or to go home.

I am not sure where you volunteer but it is clearly NOT on the 2nd floor where the shenanigans happens. Your volunteering must be limited to selling snacks in front of the cafeteria or handing out hot dogs to the teachers because I have ZERO clue who you are. Maybe instead of selling snacks you should start selling pencils. These kids come in wearing Jordans, texting on their iphones, and having in depth conversations about their PS4s but never have a pencil. You give them a pencil 1st period and by 3rd they are asking for another one. If you are so concerned with finding out why these kids have expensive sneakers, phones, and video games instead of pencils perhaps you should do that during the 9.5hrs a day every day.

09X042,"['Hello everyone.  I don\'t know if writing this here matters but I am willing to try my best to get my unpopular opinion out.  The truth is this school does not do right by children and the staff.  We\'re supposed to pretend everything is ok, our principal is right a hundred percent of the time, and the children are perfect.  That is not the case.  PS 42 is a dysfunctional school because of it\'s leadership and the teachers who don\'t stand by the rights of the children.  There are many incidents swept under the rug, not documented, and/or ignored.  Children are being bullied in the class and especially at lunch.  It pains me because my father attended this school, I did, and now my daughter and it is a school with low expectations.  My daughter had glue poured on her uniform pants.  When I attempted to speak to the counselor, she was busy.  I spoke with Ms. Orduz, the principal, during dismissal and was told the matter would be resolved.  My daughter the next day complained that the student had attacked another one of my daughters peers without consequence.  I on my own reached out to the parent and was shocked to find out that she did not know about the incidents.  The mother was pleasant and heard me out but she also wondered why the school had not informed her.  When I dropped off my daughter the next day I let Ms. Velencia know I had spoken with the parent and told her that the parent did not know.  I asked why was the parent not informed and her response was, ""We\'re busy planning trips.""  \n\nWhere is this schools priorities?  What is it they value?  It starts at the top and Ms. Orduz has illustrated in my opinion bad leadership more times than I can count.', ""This is my 3rd year with the school and the teachers are cool and nice.  The principal is rude and disrespectful.  She's too weak on discipline often trying to hide situations that have happened.  For example when the student threw the laptops out of the window, the big brawl during lunch last year, the fight in the classroom.  There were no resolutions.  Talk to you kids.  The principal has no discipline."", ""The parent coordinator at this school is the biggest cheerleader for the principal.  My child was attacked in the middle of the hallway while the teacher was with the class.  I brought my concerns to Ms. Solis the parent coordinator.  She brought me to the guidance counselor.  Supposedly the issue was addressed.  Then my child was attacked by the same student during lunch.  I again spoke with Ms. Solis who referred me to the principal and her assistant principals.  Again I was assured the issue would be addressed.  Then a couple of weeks later my child was punched in his back during lunch time.  I asked my child who was watching the class, he stated that no one was watching the class because the assistant principal was showing the lady that was supposed to watching the class something on her cellphone.\n\nI again spoke with Ms. Solis about the lack of supervision for both children and adults.  Ms. Solis went on a long tangent about how Ms. Orduz rewards children, there are all these wonderful trips, Ms. Orduz cares.  What does that have to do with my concerns.  I'm worried about my child.  The job of a parent coordinator is to create a welcoming school environment for parents and helping to address parents’ concerns.  Not be the personal cheerleader for the principal.  How can there be improvements if you are in denial about about is going wrong?  The lack of supervision is quite troubling."", ""PS 42 is unorganized.  It is difficult to have a legit conversation with the principal about student progress because she tries to win you over by being nice.  The assistant principal is clueless.  It's very accurate that if you attend a low preforming elementary school you will most likely end up in a low preforming middle school.  Where does that lead, to a low preforming high school.  I have nothing against the principal but she comes off as delusional when you attempt to speak to her about real topics.  You can't make any suggestions because she has all the answers and is very defensive.  Various teachers, not just my daughter's teacher,  have shared with me how frustrated they are with the lack of support and  chaos at the school.  Ms. Orduz needs help in organizing her priorities or the school will continue to fail.  Look at the data it speaks for itself.  See how many people think it could be better.

I met with the assistant principal and she focused on incidents that did not involve my child and made me began questioning the structure of class and consequences.

One time we received a progress report and I ask for a personal meeting and I was told that the report was self- explanatory and a meeting wouldn't be necessary like my son and his needs wearing important all to her ,so we met with the teacher and the assistant principal of my son's grade and during the meeting we were told that even if he's sick we should try to bring him to school and my son suffers from severe asthma and I explained that if he's having trouble breathing he is unable to focus properly in the classroom because he has trouble breathing she said I quote does a doctor tell you that he cannot come to school and I said if he cannot breathe he cannot be in school and she said maybe an hour or two he can I'm giving the school benefit of a doubt if nothing changes this yr his future would be grim with this school ."", ""This is difficult for me.  I do not even how to begin.  I did not know of this website but I am happy to have discovered it thanks to the Assistant Principal Ms. Velez.

Truth is I don't know how I feel after I left her room that day which is why I am expressing myself here.

After almost 3 years as a parent of an Eagle middle school student, note that this is my opinion based on my experience, and I am sure that many can offer a complete opposite observation.  Forgive the long post, but here it goes…\n\nAs a parent who was excited to be a part of what Eagle claim\nto offer its scholars, their families and the community at large, I was excited to join the family. I thought that it would be a good place for my son to be during such a transitional part of his life (middle school, puberty, expanded independence, etc.). The idea of being surrounded on a daily basis by intelligent and influential men of color – something that isn’t shoved down our throats via the media especially - was a welcome experience. I also looked forward to the ideas of structure, the uniform policy, and the fact that this\nwas a single gender institution. There would also be a mentor’s program that the boys were required to take part in and many other activities that would make Eagle more about an “experience” as opposed to just going to school. And while I think we were all gung ho about this mission that we would take together, to introduce our boys/scholars to the possibilities, the actual execution of these goals have left a lot to be desired in my experience as a parent of an Eagle middle schooler.\n\nThere is an impression that I got that always bothered me\nwhen attending the bi-monthly parent meetings – an air of superiority and half-truths being fed to the masses when – if you peeked behind the curtain, things were not being run as portrayed when someone is on the open mic. Teachers would boast about how available they are – via email, telephone, whenever – and how they give homework every night, when in practice that is not the norm. There are some teachers who, despite the rock and the hard place they find themselves in oftentimes, make the effort, but the ones who do not make their staff look bad as a whole. Some have a dismissive attitude that has often had me looking at them like “well, if you’re like this with me - an adult – then I can imagine how you communicate with my son when I’m not looking.”\n\nOh, and that wonderful online email system – Pupil Path/ Skedula – that is such a wonderful tool that can keep us all involved and up to\ndate with our child’s progress…the one where you can send and receive emails, check out their grades…see “real time” progress…it’s not a requirement for teachers to use, they don’t all use it, many don’t check email (one teacher told me that for practically half of this school year his “email didn’t work”, and sometimes the grades for assignments aren’t posted until just before the marking period grades are due… when it’s too late to do anything about it. In addition, school work is not sent home after it’s graded, so I ask quite pointedly, how do I help my son study if I can’t see his work and the teacher\ncomments until parent-teacher conference which, to reiterate, is too late as far as the marking period is concerned?\n\nFrustration with new the Common Core standards way of teaching has been the thorn in everyone’s side. Teachers still don’t know how\nto teach it, and we parents – who did not learn in this manner – have a difficult time helping them with their work. I understand the Common Core standards in theory, but in practice it has been a difficult pill to swallow for all involved. With that understood, as an adult and a professional, there is something called appropriate behavior despite whatever frustrations one is experiencing. \n\nThe assistant principals really are the foot soldiers who, I think, are trying their best to do what they can, but why do I have to keep\nrunning to the assistant principals because the dean or teachers are ignoring emails or phone calls and messages?\n\nThe staff’s idea of what is and isn’t bullying is an essay that I won’t write at this time, but as a parent of a student who has had his\npossessions taken from him (in front of a teacher) and thrown down the stairs, and in a separate incident, a bag of glitter dumped over his head in art class – I am beyond sick and tired of the adults not following up with ME. If I ask what the status is on something, tell me SOMETHING. I actually don’t expect resolutions to most of the incidents that go on there, but tell me something.\n\nI made attempts to reach out to teachers when my son was out\nsick, in an attempt to get work for him to do and I have heard nothing from any of them. I copy the dean – nothing! I sent the email as an FYI to the assistant principals and the parent coordinator – a woman who has doggedly worked and has truly been the people’s champion – just so they can see  that the very communication and involvement\nthat the teachers ask of us parents goes ignored.\n\nI stopped going to the parent meetings for this very reason. And as a parent I own the fact that I am in some way disappointing my son by not involving myself in anything at the school anymore, but I have long since grown tired of hearing the speeches, hearing about how former Mayor Bloomberg and his administration supported the efforts of the school, hearing about how another school is going up somewhere else like a new Starbucks, when the flagship school has yet to “work out the kinks” to make it the place that a lot of us hoped for. I hate that my attitude has changed from “go team, go” to “let’s just get through the rest of the year.”\n\nAnd while my own disappointments are that – my own – the boys\nare the ones caught in the crossfire. \n\nParent involvement has always been something that I have always\nmarveled over – parents show up to those meetings in droves (unlike myself this current school  year – I admit that I gave up trying to navigate through so much BS), but it is so encouraging and I\nwish them the best. Their attendance alone shows that there are more people still ready and willing to make things better than not.\n\nGood luck to everyone at the school or those considering\nattending. I wish everyone the best and hope that if anything, the level of true, honest communication gets better because the only way we are going to help our boys to achieve the things that we hope for them is to work together.', 'Two years ago, I posted the wonderful review below about Eagle Academy after the completion of my son\'s first year.  Sadly, I have to agree with you to some extent........Eagle has changed.  I too, have had some negative experiences with some of the faculty and administrative staff.  Though the sixth grade was wonderful, the two following years grew progressively worse!  The eighth grade was particularly frustrating with more than one teacher/administrator, resulting in my husband and I deciding in the end to hire a private tutor to assist my son with his studies.  In all fairness, I have to add that I have found quite a few teachers and administrators who are caring and willing to go above and beyond to assist with issues.  I, personally, have had individuals who were not directly involved be the ones to offer the greatest level of support and assistance with finding a resolution to my issues.  \n\nI don\'t think that any school will air their deficiencies to prospective students and parents, so I never expect such.  I also understand that while Eagle may LIKE to only accept the cream-of-the-crop students (wouldn\'t every school), they are a public school bound by NYC Dept. of Education rules and regulations, as well as working to uphold the mission of 100 Black Men (which founded Eagle Academy) to serve a population of minority students that are often ""lost"" within the educational system.  This may also mean that students who academically inclined to do well and/or are from more stable family backgrounds are exposed to others that are not like minded.  Look at the admissions criteria:  Priority for admissions is given to Bronx residents, and those that attend an information session.  Not the strictest standards.  They try to do their best with the students they have.\n\nAs a parent who has had experiences, both positive and negative, with charter schools, Catholic schools and public schools, I realize how difficult it has become to navigate something that was so much easier to do when I was a child.....get a good education!  Though my son is happy at Eagle, I am more worried about his preparedness for college.  I\'ve let him know that as he enters high school, he has to begin to take control of his own destiny (I\'m not letting go yet) and take responsibility for the things that will ensure him a brighter future.  If he fails to do so, then I will do it for him........and that will mean leaving Eagle.\n\nCertainly, Eagle is not for every child.  No one school is.  But Eagle, in my opinion, does have its strengths.  I will remain active and supportive, make myself seen on a regular basis, and maintain my network of individuals within the school that I know to be supportive and reliable.  I am not solely relying on Eagle alone to prepare my son for college (my son is involved in extracurricular academic programs).  I let him stay because he wants to, but he also knows that if that feeling changes..........we can make change happen.\n\nGood luck to all parents that are proactive in their quest for a good education for their children!  It\'s not easy, but it\'s not impossible.', 'Lady 5\nI am glad that I have read this.My son is having problems with students and teachers and reading these statements lets me know that this is not the first time issues have risen.

I would have tried the high school years (which I've heard from other parents) is a better experience there, but once my son expressed that he felt he didn't feel prepared for high school, I made the decision to leave NYC altogether. I have many friends who are teachers or work in education in other capacities and so I am aware of some of the things they have to juggle before they can even get into the classroom and teach.

09X413,"[""Many people say bad things about this school, but it is not so bad. I feel as if the school would have been better if more opportunities were given to ALL the students. I was in the honor's class but it was not all that because there were some kids in the honor's class who, based upon their grades, honestly did not belong there. That was the bad thing. The good thing is that I was pushed to do my best, and took AP Spanish which helped me to get a college credit in Spanish, which was geat! I don't think there is any discrimination against non-honor students. Actually, non-honor students should feel lucky because they get to relax more and do not have to feel way to pressured like I felt sometimes, but it was worth it. So, downside is that the school needs to offer more activities. Also, they need more teachers and more subjects such as physics and another language besides Spanish. Not everyone wants to learn Spanish, even though it is good to learn due to it being a rising language. Another thing is that some of the staff need to be changed because many of them had really bad attitudes and disrespected the students. The principal needs to get himself together because before I left, he seemed to stop being seen and stopped calling the students winners. So, I don't know what was going on with him, but I hope he seems more excited about the school now. Medical detectors are good for safety, even though it was annoying sometimes. So, the school is not the most amazing school ever, but it is not the worst either. I think if opportunities can not be offered in school, the counselors should offer some outside resources that can helpful to ALL students. At least it does not have violence like TAFT had back in the days.  It seems much more safe.
