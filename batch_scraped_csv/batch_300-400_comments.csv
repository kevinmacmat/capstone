PAs are doing this across the city, because their children benefit, and a public education is otherwise free!  and, the program was a success - extra teachers assistants were hired to help teach 8 kindergarten classes, up from 5 or 6 the year before!  another example of how the staff and parent body work together so beautifully at this school...\n\nbut the kindergarten fundraising program had nothing to do with the music teachers.  in that case, the administration was just trying to upgrade the music department staff.  the most direct path they saw was to take a year off from the music program, which would allow them to excess the music teachers, and reapply the funds elsewhere.  then the following year, they could reallocate money for an all new music department and start fresh with new teachers.  but because the parents reacted so strongly,  the admin retreated and rehired the same teachers.  whether this was the right or wrong way to go about trying to renew the music program can be debated, but everyone should realize it was done with the intention of ultimately providing a BETTER music program.  if you look at all of the other improvements in the arts programs and elsewhere at the school since this administration took over, it's obvious that they were just trying to upgrade the music program as well, not to take it away permanently."", ""I will give you benefit of the doubt, although it's not at all what the administration presented to the school about the music teachers. They said that they will rely on outside non-profits exclusively as a way to have music at school, and if PA wants to supplement, they were welcome to raise funds. Ironically, none of these outside programs is supposed to function without a permanent music teacher, and once two of them both threatened to walk and take away the instruments they donated, the principal reinstated one teacher. There is no better music program, a three  years later. \n\nAs far as K, assistant principal said to many parents who complained that paras don't make money for the school, and most schools in the city don't have K assistants, and canned all of them. Of course, donations to the TA fund are not mandatory - that would be illegal. But it was made clear to us that if we don't donate, our kids will have one adult in the classroom. Which they still did, for half the day."", ""Yeah, they kind of had to present it that way... They couldn't say they were trying to replace teachers, there would have been massive blowback.

Nevertheless, I still tested in to Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Music and Art choosing the later and attended the later. The commitment to honors students was high then as well.  Mentoring, supporting student activism, and making sure that the non-honors kids feel valid and have a path to their future are important ways forward.  Alternative gym credits and eating options may be the best way to overcome deficiencies is those areas, as well as developing local community volunteerism in the arts - use computers, internet, the close K-5s etc.  Students and parents can propose, plan, and promote anything if they are committed. As to the HS, middle school division - why not propose a close mentoring program - a big sister, big brother program at the school level for academic and social development and integration.

Considering how well the school has done with insufficient funding, it is exciting to imagine what can happen when the funding is there.  I like TAPCo.

Ever since I\'ve been to this school (I started here in sixth grade and now I am in twelfth), I have received support from the teachers. The students are a mix, between some who create an environment of toxicity, somehow freshmen skipping every class and exhibiting symptoms of senioritis in their first year, and students who exhibit nothing but positivity and acceptance-- But isn\'t that just how teenagers are? That\'s what high school has always been. Many people complain about this school (we\'ve been promised lockers since I was in sixth grade, and we just got them now), but they don\'t actively participate in the amazing changes to come. Yes, I\'m sad that these changes aren\'t moving as fast as we would like, but I also know TAPCo had a rough history before I even got here, before we switched principals, and we are still recovering. I have been here as long as the current principal, Ron Link, and I\'ve seen his drive to create an environment where the students can flourish, his enthrallment with everything we do. He truly has a passion for leading this school, and cares deeply, showing responsibility for his students. This year, we are doing a production of the musical, ""Urinetown,"" and he attended a rehearsal, watching us learn choreography, his face lighting up as he saw our drive and our enthusiasm for the arts. This school truly does work hard to facilitate our needs, and I hope the improvement I\'ve seen start continues even after I\'m gone. The teachers teach at a slow pace (which may be to allow the average student to keep up, but it doesn\'t challenge me in the slightest) to enhance comprehension, they offer their lunches up to help students, they listen to ideas on everything from shows to their new rooftop garden (which should be opening soon). The arts programs help students by giving them opportunities to see professional shows (priced up to hundreds of dollars for the average attendees) for free and provide networking for students who plan to go into the industry.\nOverall, this school is decent and i cherish my experiences here. I am proud to graduate a TAPCo Tiger.', 'I arrived at TAPCo in July. Since my arrival I have experienced dedication for education from teachers who really care about the academic achievement of their students. I have experienced test prep, Lunch tutoring, Saturday tutoring, after-school turoring, etc. I have experienced courteous staff members who collaboratively get together with one purpose, the kids, and their education.\nProfessionalism is demonstrated everyday. When Parents arrive at TAPCo, they are greeted with the utmost courteousy. Parents leave TAPCo after their visit completely happy that they took the time out to come to our school.\n\nI am valued at TAPCo. My opinions count and my feedback is listened to and respected.\nI am very glad that I am at TAPCo.', 'I have been a teacher at TAPCo for the last 11 years, and I have seen a lot of positive change throughout that time. Of course there are challenges on a day to day basis, but these challenges are a general part of teaching. Academically, TAPCo has added 4 AP classes in the last two years - AP U.S. History, AP Language, AP Capstone (Seminar and Research) and AP Computer Science. There is ample opportunity for students to receive additional supports from teachers when they are studying for Regents exams. There is lunchtime and after school Regents Prep, and teachers in the High School do a good job of making sure to build in time to review and prepare students during their classes. There are programs in the building that also have helped students in both the Middle School and High School have a voice in their local community, specifically through working with Generation Citizen in the 7th, 8th and 12th grades. Additionally, in 8th grade students have the opportunity to take and pass the 9th Grade Algebra and Living Environment Exams, meaning that they can enter High School with two regents, and multiple credits, already on their transcripts.\n\nThere have been many other improvements in the building since I have been here as well. Six years ago, students, staff and parents signed petitions for things that they wanted to see change in the building. As we all know, things in the DOE move slowly, but we have started to see the fruits of those petitions. In the last few years, the school worked to bring in a Health Clinic to the building so that students are missing much less time for illness and doctors appointments. I often have the clinic call down to my class so that I can send a student up for an appointment that day. This year, EVERY student in the school (Grades 6-12) got brand new lockers (there had been no lockers in the building). Further, in May there will be a grand opening of a brand new Rooftop Garden performance space that will give students at every grade level the opportunity to learn how to garden using a state of the art greenhouse and garden planters  - something that can be integrated into science classes in the building. It will also give a place for classes to go during fall and spring to have discussions outside and to see arts performances. \n\nOverall, all this is to say that TAPCo is not a school without faults, but that it is a place that has a caring staff that is working hard to improve for all of the student that go here.', 'I recently visited to TAPco as a Children’s Education Manager in district 9. What I saw was a school serving a very rough and undeserved community, very well.  While students get the opportunity to learn about the arts, they also learn about all the elements behind the scenes of productions as well. This school was nominated as a Best High School in America in 2016 by U.S News & Reports. They based this date by comparing TAPco with the other schools in the geographic area. So while the test scores are still below the citywide average, it is out performing the other neighborhood.  Also, the ELL students at this school are performing above the citywide average. This is attributed hiring teachers with bilingual certification and school focus on the social needs of a child. On the day of my visit, a student came in with no jacket on a brisk winter day. A staffer noticing, discretely took him into a room where he could select a coat.  The school is not big on suspensions. They utilize Restorative Circles that allows kids and staff to develop communication tools and address issues through discussion.\nYes, bullying does exist at this school but there are many avenues of support and conflict resolution. I saw students freely come up to Principal Link to help them resolve a conflict. They already used their tools, but came to an impasse. He willing went over and within a few minutes it was resolved. I know not all situation end like this, but knowing supports exists helps. They have even used dramatization to express the harmful impact of bullying. The community has gangs and staff has been trained to look for signs of trouble. The school has also formulated a strong relationship with the police precinct.\nWhile many schools are skimping on math and science, TAPco integrates arts, creativity and core education together in STEAM programming. I saw Mr. Mudrick (A CTE Award Honored Teacher) utilize an investigative experiment, “The OJ Challenge,” during math class that had all the kids focused.  In Stage production, Bud Thorpe, performed an experiment explaining how electricity and magnetism works in preparation for a lesson on circuits and wiring. Band class was being taught by Professional Jazz Musician, Curtis Haywood, as he diligently trained students play both syncopated and modified renditions from the same selection of music they were reading.\nTAPco, is working in an environment where at least half the student population is low income, entering 6th grade with academic remediation, even with the screening. They have been consistently improving and continue to fight for the same resources as other schools in their district.', ""There is NOTHING good about this school.

On the contrary the presence of technology is larger than you may expect. However my immediate advice for those who want to interact closely with tech (aside from those who simply want access to a computer) to join either the media club or the MOUSE Squad. Both of these clubs have worked closely in recent years, largely as a result of the students' close interaction, and will allow you to interact with a variety of tools such as cameras, computers, software, hardware equipment, and our new 3-D Printer (you can thank MOUSE Squad'14 for that). \nI do not know much about the administrative staff, but my experience with the teachers were wonderful; once I showed my seriousness and my ambitions for greater heights, they showed their support in encouragement and helped me through my struggles. During my time here I have only had ONE very unfavorable experience with ONE teacher. For the most part my teachers were supportive, capable and inspirational. \nI have looked at other high schools in the area and quite frankly IN-Tech doesn't compare so badly. We have our own building, no tedious metal detectors, a modern aesthetic look, and a majority of good teachers (so long as IN-Tech doesn't let go of another one- I am criticizing the school for letting a certain capable APUSH teacher go last year, 2013). Admittedly this school doesn't have enough opportunities for everyone but this is NYC! To any high school students I encourage you to find non-profits and youth communities around you. A few I have worked with before, and helped me develop my resume and professional skills, are MOUSE, REV, GEAR UP, Global Kids, and HIVE NYC. Welcome to your first step in the real world kids: intro to looking for opportunities. Good Luck and I hope you never regret a decision you make."", 'First of all, the only reason as to why this school worries about the attendance is because in order for a student to receive a good education they will have to attend school. Additionally, the uniform policy is essential because students will have to learn how to dress professionally. Addiitonally, this school does care about the education that students receive and those students who excel in certain skills are offered more opportunities than others because they express true determination and dedication towards their education. It is a lie that students receive more aid if they are immigrants, everyone is treated the same because we are untied as a school.

To the point where Ive reported it couple of times and it didnt really work. No, they dont really keep you anonymous. On top of that some of these students fought and stuff around the school but hey, nobody takes action unless that happens.\n\nIn the end, we all know eachother like fine wine. We knew who did what, we knew what our connections with eachother were like, etc. And as someone who started from 2nd grade, leaving by 8th— 194 was like a life journey for me. I learnt how to grow thick skin, how to handle hard work, and how to live no matter how low things could be.

Like any other school, there are bullies. I was bullied for my weight and my stutter problem and was driven to depression. However, the friends you make at this school are the ones who will always help you out, will listen to you, and care for you. \n\nStudent life is pretty good. There are rarely any fights, if at all. Everyone seems to get along pretty well. Of course, there are some bad apples in the bunch, but it\'s such a small problem that it should be overlooked. Many students hate the uniform, but once it was put in place, the vibe felt even safer than it already was, no one would criticize each other for their clothes, since they had the same ones on. Recess is where it all goes down. The friendships, the drama, all of the regular activities you\'d go through as a child and teenager. \n\nThe academics are great, all of the teachers care about you and will always listen to what you have to say. They teach very well. I had a problem with a teacher in the Seventh grade, but this problem was dealt with and no harm was done to me or the teacher. It wasn\'t even intentional, the teacher didn\'t know about certain things I was insecure about and he mentioned them. I should\'ve notified him about these things. To be honest, he was one of my favorite teachers, because he took me out of class and personally apologized to me. That day, he had a lot of respect from me. He did what no one would usually do in that situation. He could\'ve written a letter, or sent me an email. But he apologized personally. The teachers here really care about their students. They\'re all really nice and use really fun methods to teach, and that really helps the student feel safe in the classroom and makes them want to learn.\n\nThis is possibly one of the best schools in the Bronx, and your child will be happy to spend their childhoods and beginnings of their teenage years here at PS/MS 194. \nThey\'ll face hardships, learn about the realities of life, grow and develop into bright young students. They\'ll make friends, lose friends, figure out who they are as people. \nThey\'ll meet wonderful people and do wonderful things.\n\nWhen I graduated, I looked back to when I had heard about this school.
