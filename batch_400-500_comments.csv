For the sake of the innocent children and demeaned teachers, I sure hope this is the case. \n\nMy child has suffered tremendously, from not receiving mandated services on his IEP to being bullied in front of several adults without any help! He has been placed in an ICT where there isn\'t even 2 teachers. My son is also an ELL student and has not saw the ELL teacher yet. I brought it to her attention on several occasions to know avail! She spent more time lying, making excuses and covering things up than correcting or just being honest. She even ""forced"" teachers to lie. My child will no longer be attending this school.

Everyday there is a fight. What's sad about it is that often this attitude is a reflection of their home life. Also, if there is a problem, the teachers and staff don't follow the procedures. A kid choked my child in the hallway.  I filed a complaint and i had to keep calling to make sure they were on top of it. In the end that kid is still in school and the school's only response is they're working with that kid and she's going through a lot of problems. My children have to defend themselves on a daily basis because kids want to hit and cause trouble. When I  complained  to the teachers, no one wants to resolve the issue. They keep passing it to the next person. They really don't have the best interests at heart and their jobs are just a paycheck. This school has too many issues. ""]"

They are going to send us to the 9/11 memorial, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and a dinner at Dave and Busters for 100 dollars for a senior trip. That has to be the worst senior trip ever, also with the new principal who used to be the assistant principal, the school is running out of money. Spanish class has been dropped, Music has been dropped for 8th grade, Health has been dropped, and we barely have any space. You carry a BUNCH of stuff every day for school, and get yelled at every morning when we line up in the gym before school stars. The assistant principal just yells at us for like ten minutes, and we have to do drills like army soldiers. The school probably isn't #1 in the District anymore, even if so District 12 is horrible, so it isn't hard to be #1 in it. The teachers have problems with fellow teachers, (which we have to call professors) and they occasionally talk bad about other teachers. ELA is the same thing every year in Kappa III, Science is alright, in Social Studies you learn the same thing every year. Math is complicated, and not explained well. Do NOT go to this school, you will regret it. The cafeteria is horrible as well, and it's crowded with 2 grades in the cafeteria, and we barely go outside because if a student does something wrong, everyone gets blamed for it. The motto is ''It's we not me in Kappa III.'' Unless you want to learn absolutely nothing and spend the most useless years of your life with a HORRIBLE senior trip, don't go here. We only have like 1 trip a year as well, and that's on the yellow school bus. The only good trip I recall was going to six flags but only our class got it because we won a competition. The teachers are also BLIND in this school and DEAF. Students cuss a lot behind the teachers backs (literally) and hit other students right in front of the teacher's eyes and get away from it. This school is HORRIBLE, and is BROKE, and you will hate it here. The people you meet here are really cool, but some of them are really annoying as well. The neighborhood is horrible, and is really poor. You will probably get chased a couple of times, and possibly jumped if you say the wrong thing. It's also very unfair in the school because people who skip class ALL THE TIME and who cheat in exams and projects always get the Gold Honor Roll (95% average or above) or the Silver or Bronze honor roll. It's really unfair, but since they cheat on everything they get a free pass through junior high school. The school is only 2% White, and 2% Asian. So if you're white or Asian prepare to get made fun of. If any one of your parents are middle class, you will have to pay for lunch, every day. There's no sports clubs in the school, besides nyjtl         (New York Junior Tennis League) which you have to stay until like 5:30 and you barely do any tennis, and they never win ANYTHING. The school is just a horrible experience, 80% of the teachers are useless, but some of the teachers are really good. I wouldn't recommend to go to this school, it's really bad, and we don't even have lockers. We don't even have desks to store our stuff in or anything. We have to carry a bunch of stuff in our bookbags, including our binders. It's horrible. There's no school plays, and you're never in the auditorium because it's shared by 4 DIFFERENT SCHOOLS!

While away from PS8, their academics slid below grade level which extra attention could not abate.  Two years after returning to PS8 they are thriving academically and testing at and above grade level.  Yes, some of the gains can be attributed to a better classroom learning environment which is likely tied to socio-economics.  Both schools had passionate and skilled teachers, but the high expectations of parents at PS8 in combination with a responsive administration effectively developing and supporting the teaching community makes a huge difference.  Upon our return, the improvements in teaching were noticeable.  Teachers are better coordinated at the grade level and better-skilled at their craft.  Expectations for students are higher.  Academic issues and suggestions parents had raised five years ago for upper elementary students were heeded and implemented.  While the principal may not be as personally accessible as when the school was smaller, PS8 continues to grow academically under his leadership.

I've been impressed with the ways I've seen the curriculum evolve (both the new math curriculum, Bridges, and the way in which the school is implementing the Common Core).  These last few years have also seen after-school programming expand, and before-school and lunch clubs and teams grow (Green Team, Band, Math Olympiads).

The great thing about a school this small is that everyone knows your name and personality, not just your face. The teachers are so much closer to us students than if we were in a school with 300 kids. Because everyone is so close we are referred to by name and not by 'class 702' or something. Due to this, the teachers can help us become individuals much more easily than most schools can offer. Also, I'd like to put more stress on the explorations. Explorations are truly amazing, and I feel like we learn so much from them. Can you name any other school that teaches it's 6th graders about neuroscience and political artists like Ai Wei Wei? For a developing school, I would rate MS8 as something with potential, as a school I would rate it as average."", ""Ok disregarding the fact that you think that being a individual means people knowing your personal information (in which case the NSA is your besty), let me clarify ; When I said not every student is treated as a individual I meant not every students interests and needs are met. I meant that many people are looked over in order to cater or spend time on others. I know that every teacher knows our name and perhaps a short snipet of our personalities , something cut out of grades and progress reports no doubt, but unless we seek them out they don't really know about us or how we feel. \nRegarding the rhetorical question about exploration there are a few schools that are exploration based and are always doing what we do for 6 weeks. \nListen I love our school, and I think it has allot of promise but I feel absolutely no need to sugar coat it's cons."", ""Well, I like the sarcasm about the NSA being my bestie. That one blew my mind with it's wittiness. \n\n\nIn all seriousness, I think you're asking for to much. I think that you have to remember that MS8 is a school, not some private tutoring service. In fact, we're a public school. The community at MS8 is very strong, and when has anyone actually suffered because they were 'misrepresented' or their identity wasn't completely known to a teacher? Adolescence (being a tween; whatever you wanna call it) is a time where we find our own identities, and our teachers are expected to have all of our personality changes memorized?! If we can't even find our own selves, who are we to expect them to. To me, what you are saying is a little contradictory. You say that teachers don't know anything important about us unless we seek them out to share our 'feelings'. But, since when have teachers (or anyone for that matter) been expected to be able to read a humans identity just by spending 5 days a week with them, usually only talking with them for a microscopic fraction of that time? Of course it would be so that our teachers won't be able to learn our identities if we don't talk to them one-on-one, humans aren't telepathic. It would make more sense to me if your argument was that the kids are rude and don't care about others individuality, but complaining about how the teachers don't know every nook and cranny of our changing minds is like saying that someone who has only read the blurb of a book is in the wrong for not being able to write an analyzation of the plot.\nFinally, I don't want you to 'sugar coat the cons'. My point is that I don't think that you're problem with MS8 is a real con; from what I've heard, this is how it is, and always will be in middle school."", 'The middle school is OK.

There seems to be no place in school to discuss race outside of the black/white binary within school, even though there are kids of color who do not fit into these categories in the school body. I am delighted to be part of a group of parents where we discuss how to select books, consume media and facilitate conversations about race with our children, which is very helpful. \n\nFurther to this, I have not found an effective way to facilitate conversations around the social emotional plans for children facing adversity. It is one thing for a child to act out, as was my case, it is another thing to create compassionate, empathetic learning spaces, that buffer the impacts of adversity. There are some great programs that do this but this is a leadership decision, it requires empathy at the top levels of the school, and assumes classroom educators are given the time and space to do this work and meet the demands of their day to day tasks. It also requires empathy from parents and understanding change takes time, criticism no matter how well intentioned is difficult to hear and as parents ask for this I know the school will be responsive. I have seen so many instances of an idea being brought into the school by parents and then moved forward. I am just not sure how it happened and can also accept I may not the right messenger but I have brought this to the administration's attention. \n\nThis school is worth a look, decide what you want, at the time of writing there is huge emphasis on testing so decide if that's for you. It is a great school but it is not perfect, nothing is so it would be unfair to expect that going in. You just have to decide if its for you and find your tribe once you get there.

My child\'s Kindergarten teacher was the best possible Kindergarten teacher - we were blown away by what a great teacher she was and when people would hear which teacher we had, they\'d say ""OH, you\'re so lucky, she\'s AMAZING!""\n\nHowever, I\'m a bit disappointed by the teacher this year and very underwhelmed by the school\'s handling of a child who is academically advanced in a certain subject.  They really don\'t do anything to accelerate a child who is in the first grade but does math or reads on a third-grade level, so that child is basically asked to sit around not learning anything until the other children catch up.  With an age range of nearly a year in any class, that means that if your child is advanced in math AND one of the older children in the class, she is going to school and not being taught anything she doesn\'t already know, which is very frustrating for the child.  After speaking with the principal and teacher, I was told that they would send home ""enrichment"" math homework but they expected the far too easy math homework to get done BEFORE moving onto the harder stuff.\n\nThe really disappointing thing is the principal makes so much of their focus on whole, healthy children but seems to really believe that children can SIT from 8:20 AM - 2:40 PM, with a paltry 15-minute recess, then if they have afterschool, SIT from 2:40 - 4 or 5 pm, then go home and SIT and do homework, then SIT and eat dinner, SIT and finish their homework, then go to bed, and that can be their entire day, and they can be healthy sitting on their behinds all day every day.  When I told her how the homework takes up our entire evening if we do all of it, and leaves no time for playing, learning a language, learning about music, or anything else children need to do, she told me ""Maybe you are overbooking your child."" \n\nWith THREE one-hour after school enrichment classes per week, and the desire for my child to learn a language (which they do a poor job of teaching at the school), and an hour on the playground most days after school, I am overbooking my child?  No, they are overbooking my child by taking up all of our time at home with repeating the school work that they do in school all day, and asking the kid to sit still all day long and not move their bodies.', 'Yes, please update us!

Congrats - this is actually the first totally unnecessarily nasty comment I've read on insideschools. \n\nCrazy = expecting your child to be educated up to his potential. Right. "", 'Thank you for your comments, Melissa, b/c I love the neighborhood and have been thinking of PS 11 as a top school on my list, but I think I would share your concerns wholeheartedly.', 'In response to A. Panda Grapes comments (writing as a PS11 parent):\n\nI\'m pretty opposed to the idea of the ""best"" teacher in a certain grade.  Honestly, I know five of the six K teachers (one is relatively new to PS11) and they are all amazing in different ways and the school really does its best to match students to a teacher\'s style in all grades.  I\'m not convinced that playground gossip actually is an accurate indicator of ""best"" teacher.\n\nAs for the school\'s treatment of ""advanced"" students.  There have been NUMEROUS children in my children\'s classes throughout the grades who read significantly ""above grade level"".  I have never heard any of the parents indicating their child is not challenged and have found my ""above grade level"" children to be engaged, progressing, and happy.  The conversations, analysis, group work, and writing allows children of all abilities to respond at his/her level - in my opinion.  Math - yes, they do follow a curriculum - - but I find that the math talks, the literacy based math questions, and group math keep all children engaged and challenged (okay, you found one way to solve this, can you find another?)\n\n As for children sitting all day - I have found that in first grade students have recess, one day of PE a week, one day of playworks every other week, and Mark Morris dance once a week for a portion of the year.  During mass preps, the children go outside and play.  I have never found PS11 to be a sit and stare school - - children move around the classroom throughout the day.  After School Enrichment (the parent led after school program) does have the option for children who have a gap between school and their class (the older children) to be taken out of the school with a caregiver and return for their class, to play outside with a Playworks coach, or sit in the cafeteria and do homework.  I\'m not sure why Panda Grapes\'s child is sitting if she values moving so much or not taking a movement based after school class.  Also, there are numerous other after school programs that pick up from 11 that encourage physical activity.  After School Enrichment is one option that is not mandatory.  Personally, I have found that our boy needs to run at some point after the school day (even on PE and recess days) so we do our best to leave one hour open for either sports or free time to run at a playground in his post school schedule.\n\nAs for homework - both of my children had approximately 15-20 minutes of homework in first grade on weekdays only.  To be honest, I\'m skeptical of how advanced Panda Grape\'s first grader truly is if homework is eating up the entire evening.  I, too, am curious why the child is being signed up for three classes a week after school if it feels like there is a shortage of time.\n\nIt seems like Panda Grapes is not happy with PS11 - and may be happier elsewhere.  I just wanted to give our experience in reply to help others in the community get a well rounded picture.', 'Our children have been at the school four years now.  I can say that our appreciation for the community at ps11 has only increased each year.  You would be hard pressed to find a happier and healthier group of students and parents.  The love and respect in the building is tangible and our children have friends from all walks of life within their own neighborhood.  We are so grateful to have found such a warm community family for all of us.\n\nThe transition to Ms. Hope being principal has been seamless (of course).  Her focus on creating global citizens is a natural extension of both her personal background and the international population that makes up the school.  My children\'s friends have family from all over the world - and we are all better people for it.  Respect, effective dialogue, and true listening are hallmarks of the school.  My son, learning through the Socratic method in 3rd grade, often says to me, ""Mom, I\'d like to offer a counter point.""  The focus on well-rounded students is amazing - for free my children have learned Mark Morris dance, violin, trumpet, keyboards, saxophone (all before 4th grade).  On Saturdays, they have FREE optional test prep and school help in the morning - if that\'s you\'re thing - and Arts Academy dance, instruments, and vocals in the afternoon - if that\'s your thing.  Our children beg to be at their school any opportunity they get - and opt not to miss school when given the option.\n\nWhenever the school does have practices that don\'t align 100% with what we would want in our own ideal school pedagogue, we realize that this is at the core of what it means to be diverse.  If the school were precisely what we wanted philosophically, everyone at the school would think like us.  Because PS11 attracts families from all countries, races, ethnicities, and economic classes, there are about 800 different opinions in a school of 800.  PS11 does a fantastic job of finding a middle ground of all expectations and fostering an environment where students, parents, and faculty listen to one another in order to find what is best for ALL students at the school.  This is what meaningful diversity looks like.\n\nOn a final note - We want to extend our extreme gratitude to all the parents and staff who have worked so hard to make PS11 what it is today.  It was a long, hard process to create the beautiful community that is raising our children.  Especially Ms. Wrighton (who has moved on to change the lives of countless more children and communities) worked tirelessly to create a wonderful world for parents and children in our little piece of Clinton Hill.

The differences are small, but the strength of PS 20 programs comes from the Principal Ms. Barbera. She fights fervently to boost the French DLP and the parents are very actively involved.

PS46 has\n an award winning garden!  Last year was its inaugural year and we won \none of only two top city wide prizes from The Captain Planet Foundation.\n  The hard work of establishing a vegetable garden brought children and \nfamilies together during special after school programming.  This year we\n are expanding our already existing farm to table curriculum by adding a\n partnership with the Green Markets.  This partnership will bring garden\n fresh meals to the cafeteria on special occasions.  Additionally all \ngrades visit the nearby Brooklyn Grange roof top farm.  We are expanding\n that this year as well.  We'll be including their pollinator and \ninsects programming to our activities.  The garden was immediately successful because it is built on a tradition of sustainability study at the school.  Last year we were honored by Borough President Eric Adams for our long term outstanding contributions to Brooklyn's sustainability efforts along with only a few other schools borough wide.  This is only one component of \nour exciting school wide  STEAM programming here at PS46."", 'I am deeply saddened by the problems I keep reading about my former elementary school. I was there from 1966- 1972. I had the greatest teachers there who treated us all with kidness and respect. Mrs. Wishnow, Mrs. Manchen, and Mrs. Rivera were exemplary. I became a teacher myself because of the way they treated us. I still have nothing but fond memories of my time there. Back then, the really bright kids were able to go after school and on Saturdays to Brooklyn College and compete with other kids in the city in math, science, and history. I loved my time there at P.S. 46. As a teacher in Trenton, New Jersey, I had to deal with kids who had the same problems as any kid growing up in the ghetto; mental and physical abuse, sexual abuse, poverty, low self esteem, etc., but with the things I learned at P.S.46, I was able to last 28 years and help graduate several doctors, teachers, firemen, police officers and even some pastors. All it takes is some compassion and a sit down with the parents in which you convey to them how much you want their child to succeed, not only in your class,  but in life as well. P.S. 46 was for me, a blessing. I hope that it can become that again for future generations.', 'it is good it goes up to like 7 grade hi i am Shakia i am in then 4 grade been in that school since preschool']"

My son especially loves the makerspace in his classroom, his teachers (he stops in to give his old teachers hugs) and his classmates.

We spent our Kindergarten year here in the general education (as opposed to dual language) program, but were not incredibly impressed with our experience.  Overall it is a decent school, but they\'re obsessively driven to bring up test scores and consequently push extra work onto the students prematurely. This only proved to be a turn off for our child, who received an average of an hour of homework a night, but couldn\'t possibly do it alone so it was more like I was getting the homework. This amount of homework in Kindergarten ended up being an exercise in forced submission after a long day. \n\nKindergarten should be fun and children should not beg to stay home from school when they are that young.  It always felt like pulling teeth to communicate with our primary teacher over this (who was anything but the friendly, understanding and patient lover of children that I\'d hoped for in a Kindergarten instructor) and I never felt heard after expressing my concerns. The dual language program also takes precedence over the general education program with the general education program getting the short shrift.  When children do not have the resources or support necessary to ensure that they will be able to keep up, they are invariably held back. When I was young there were often one or two children  held back in every grade, but the numbers here are significantly higher. Still, after speaking to a parent of a second grade child in the French dual language program who asserted that her son had no extra time for extracurricular activities due to his excessive homework load, I thought that we may have been spared a bullet by not getting into that program as we are not native Spanish or French speakers. \n\nFor a school located in District 13, the fact that two thirds of the seats are given to  District 15 children seems unfairly imbalanced, particularly when there are so many other options in 15.  This used to be our zoned school, until the new building was erected and opened its doors in 2013 and then its status changed into a magnet school. Most of my neighbors with Kindergarten aged children who applied to 133 were rejected, even though we had all been told this was going to be a great thing for our community during its construction. Although the decision to do this was supposedly an attempt to achieve diversity, in this case-diversity meant bringing in more affluent, non-minority children from District 15 who were mostly interested in taking advantage of the dual language program. As a result, the dual language program has a lot more non-minorities than the general ed program, which made my child ask why most of her classmates were brown when the dual language classes were predominantly white, and this was somewhat disconcerting for me as a parent, particularly since both groups have very little interaction with each other.  This division seems to go unspoken, like the elephant in the room, and the population between dual language and general ed is decidedly disproportionate in terms of racial makeup, with classrooms separated by different floors. The disparity of privilege is often made obvious and cliques are formed among parents that leak into politics that effect everything from parent/teacher relationships and favoritism in the classroom to even after school activities.  It is not altogether accurate to paint this is an unbiased and inclusive institution. \n\nThere are a lot of great things about this school that should not go unmentioned. The facility is beautiful and new, the classrooms are accessible and cozy (each Kindergarten has a private bathroom for the little one\'s convenience) and it is clean and very well maintained. It has a small school feel to it and PS 133 offers a variety of special instruction. If your child isn\'t in the dual language program they are  still taught Spanish, in addition to music, art and theater. The PTA is strong and currently amassing even more strength and financial resources due to a committed group. Our Parent/Teacher coordinator Ahmed Dickerson, lovingly known as Mr. D is absolutely fantastic, welcoming and always available to talk to parents and students alike.  He truly is the heart and soul of PS 133 and deserves a great deal of credit for cultivating a friendly and inspired atmosphere with lots of possibility.  The auditorium is great, and used for recess when the weather is bad, and the Physical Education teacher Mr. Blatt is top notch. There\'s a lot to be proud of here, and the principal seems caring and committed. I just think that the school\'s focus is old fashioned and  traditional and their approach to progress sticks to thinking inside the box. \n\nThe tremendous amount of emphasis placed on the Common Core based curriculum might not necessarily be the most effective way to achieve excellence and motivate students, but there aren\'t any laid out plans to alter that position.  The ""Leader in Me"" program is well intentioned, but I would prefer to see them place the same emphasis on individuality, creativity and broader based learning over the ""win, win"" approach that seems forced and ineffective. When reading some of the essays from second grade posted outside of the classroom that detailed what the kids had mastered over the course of the school year, I could barely tell one child apart from another because they all stated the exact same things.  And finally, if they were not so committed to test prep, PS 133 might be less rigid in structure and teaching styles. A little more flexibility within the system would inevitably be more appealing to students. Young people should start their educations by cultivating a love of learning early in their formative educational years rather than reinforcing requirements to ensure that they fall into step with ""the program."" Strict demands dedicated to the ethic that school is work and work is hard can be educationally prohibitive to some students along with all of the pressures that accompany such formidable expectations. Even Japan is less stringent when it comes to elementary education.', 'Thank you so much!  This synopsis was superb and incredibly helpful.

Does that mean if we live in District 15, when my son graduates from 133, he will be able to choose from middle schools in both District 13 and 15?', ""InsideSchools' review is misleading. PS 133 is technically a District 13 school, because it is located in D13. According to the DOE's choice policies, every kid who attends an elementary school housed within a particular district gets access to that District's middle schools regardless of residence. This is based on location of the school, not on the school's enrollment policies. (Also, I have heard this only applies to district schools, not charters, but I haven't verified if that is true.) That means kids attending PS 133 get District 13 choice by virtue of attending PS 133, no matter where they live. \n.\nHowever, since PS 133 is not located in District 15, its graduates don't automatically also get D15 middle school choice. PS 133 5th graders only get D15 middle school choice if they reside within the area zoned for D15 middle school choice. So if you live in District 15 but attend PS 133, you would get D13 and D15 choice.  However, if you live in a District 13 middle school area (Prospect Heights, Ft. Greene, etc.) you would not get D15 middle school choice by attending PS 133. You'd just get D13 choice. \n.\nI have spoken with middle school enrollment staff at the DOE about this question and they have confirmed that my description is accurate. But if it is a key point in your consideration you should also directly confirm with the DOE, and with the charter schools, if you're interested in those."", 'New data released by the city shows that P.S. 133 is meeting its goal of offering seats to poor and immigrant kids, but with some difficulties.

There is not a rigid adherence to it, and it is short sighted to use this policy as a deal breaker when there are so many other more pertinent things to consider."", 'This is a silly reason to turn down a fantastic school. For one thing, it\'s a public school so uniforms are voluntary. No child is penalized for coming to school in pink, yellow, green or what ever instead of the official blue.  Second, the ""uniform"" is to my mind more of a dress code. Any dark blue bottom and light blue top qualifies. So kids can wear jeans or leggings (solid or patterned) or skirts (solid or patterned) every day with a blue t-shirt with their favorite animal, character, etc. and be ""in uniform."" The girls find many varieties of blue dresses to wear. if you visit the school you will not see rows of kids in blue pleated skirts/slacks and button-up shirts. You will see a variety of personal expression in the hallways. Finally most parents who are concerned about the ""uniform"" wind up liking it. You have fewer arguments and less drama about clothes when the kids know those clothes are school clothes and these are not.', ""This has been my experience, too.

13K265,"[""I graduated from here in the early 2000s.  Speaking as a troubled student who had AWFUL experiences with my previous schools to the point I was afraid to go, I'll say that Susan S. McKinney or Sands as my family calls it, was one of the best places I attended.  \n\n\n\nMrs. Holmes was tough, condescending and strict but she was someone who understood the circumstances her students come from and deeply cares about creating a place that will make the students better than the disadvantaged homes they come from.  She put the same standards on her teachers, never tolerating failure and always expecting them to always do and give better.  She took care to hire many teachers, successful, intelligent, accomplished adults who reflected and could relate to the student body.  I was taught by people who were raised in neighborhoods like mine, looked like me and had been all over the world.  They told us of their worldly and collegiate experiences but still could sit with the kids and talk about the hood.  My teachers saw me as a person and not as numbers on my record or a result of my poor circumstances.  It was my saving grace and something I still appreciate to this day because it's TOO easy for people to dismiss and misunderstand disadvantaged students and it often is very tragic.  \n\n\n\nAs for neighborhood and student body.  The entire neighborhood is rough.  There's no disputing that.  lolThe school is surrounded by several projects (Farragut, Fort Greene, Marcy) which are gonna turn out rough kids from rough homes no matter what.  It is what it is.  However, the staff, also filled with passionate, understanding people, did their utmost best to handle that without being unnecessarily cruel to the kids.  (Though it seemed like it at the time lol)  I think rather than blaming the school, try to be understanding of what they are undertaking and do everything you can to be part of the solution.  As a parent, make sure your child isn't part of the problem and be involved with the school activities.  Don't take Mrs. Holmes' attitude as a personal insult but instead focus on improvement for everybody.

We are in district but not in zone, and started in Pre-K. My son has had wonderful teachers, and I have found the school community to be vibrant and welcoming. 282 does not have the kind of PTA funding that some surrounding schools have, but it does have engaged and active parents who work in tandem with the teachers and administrators to form a really supportive partnership. Full disclosure I grew up in Park Slope and attended 282 as a kid, so I am really invested in seeing it thrive. I joined the Parent Teacher Organization as soon as my son started Pre-K and served as president for three years. During that time I got to work closely with the principal, teachers, fellow parents and school staff, and honestly having a window into the inner workings of the school has made me like it even more. \n\nThere was a lot of buzz about our last Principal, Rashan Hoke, and he was great, but I saw first-hand that many positive changes at 282 were championed by parents. I often describe 282 as the scrappy sports team in a 90s comedy, the lovable underdogs, and while I know that a principal can instill confidence, the real strength of a school is its larger community of parents, teachers, and staff. That said, I really love our new principal, Amy Rodriguez. Amy has only been at 282 for a  year but is really making strides to push 282 in a more child-focused and progressive direction. She's created a homework-optional policy for lower grades and worked hard to streamline communication and increase all kinds of social-emotional support for students (even bringing in a comfort dog!) She's filled the hallways with art and came to school on Halloween in an inflatable unicorn suit. Amy wants to make school joyful, which I think is something we need more than ever in this scary world.\n\nLest I sound overly biased, rest assured not everything is perfect. Consistent communication is a struggle (i.e. different teachers communicate using different media, and with varying regularity, which can result in a sort of grab-bag of parent engagement experiences), the school remains slightly under-enrolled and thus on a bare bones budget, which means that some enrichment programs don't last all year, or not every grade gets every enrichment offered by the school (currently the roster is visual art, dance, Spanish, music, technology/coding, gym, science, and the Green Zone gardens). The PTO raises over $100K per year and funds some of these programs, but money is always an issue. Classes are a nice size but there's only one teacher per classroom unless your child is in Pre-K or in an ICT class, which is a mix of students with special learning needs and those without, legally mandated to have two teachers in the room, one of whom is licensed in special education. The building is old and the bathrooms in particular are badly in need of renovation. 282 is very diverse compared to other Park Slope schools, and has traditionally had lots of space for out of zone and out of district kids, but it's gentrifying fast, which could change the culture. \n\nStill, for me, the pros far outweigh the cons. 282 feels like a family, and everyone there cares deeply about providing a warm, safe, space and an excellent education for our kids."", ""Parent of a first grader here!

We gave him two years to see what he had but he has shown that he does not have the deft hand needed to handle the challenges of a diverse school in a changing neighborhood.  He seemed to be doing a bit better early on but we think the pressure has gotten to him.  In fact, he seems tone deaf to issues that are important to the parents.  In a word, he doesn't seem to recognize parents as one of his constituencies.  We have had very difficult experiences with him personally as well as with the staff.  We have watched him berate dedicated parent volunteers and speak rudely to other parents.  We know of two instances of bullying that went on for months while the AVPs and principal did little or nothing to address the parental concerns.  One was in middle school and the other was in the lower grades of the elementary school.  Mr. Hoke has also displayed a dismayingly violent temper.  Earlier this year, a couple of us personally observed him getting into a shouting match in his SUV, fighting with another driver over a parking spot.  And it wasn't the only time.  Just this morning, he banged on the hood of a car that was stuck in traffic trying to turn down the block next to the school.  After banging his fists on the car, he was shouting at the driver, who had nowhere to go because of all of the double-parked cars of parents doing pick-ups.  This is very unprofessional behavior for a principal and a huge disappointment for the parents.  We had high hopes for this school but two years is too long to wait for Mr. Hoke to come around."", ""I'm not sure what is really driving this bizzare rant, but I can assure you this is not a fair reflection of Principal Hoke, and is not the opinion shared by any of the parents I know.

I now have both my children at the school and we all love it.  They are learning so much, we are meeting good friends and enjoying the many excellent events organized by the very active PTO.  Keep up the good work PS 282 and well done Principal Hoke."", ""I'm a parent and a volunteer and I've had nothing but great experiences with Principal Hoke, and I've worked with him person and observed him in dozens of situations including potentially difficult ones with some objectionable personalities. He's open, smart and engaging and, if challenged, he can be firm and professional. Which is exactly what I want in a Principal.\nIn fact, a few months ago I dropped my son off at school and was walking down 8th Avenue. A truck had hit and killed a man - there was  body lying in the street with a sheet over it - and there was a block roped off.  Rashan was there personally the next block over redirecting all the kids and parents walking from the subway stop so that they didn't get emotionally upset, and on the phone asking the school to send counselors for any kids who got exposed to the scene. That's a Principal who cares about the whole child, about families, who gets it.  The post above just doesn't ring true."", 'This comment is absolute nonsense.

I only hope this parent is not at the school anymore. We don\'t want to go back to the upheavals of a couple years ago before Mr. Hoke got here.  By the way, 282 is one of the top 3 schools in the district based on test scores. Keep up the good work Principal Hoke.', ""This is not factual at all!   I was present the last day of school when students were dismissed at noon for summer recess.  The combination of school buses picking up students, parents picking up their children in vehicles (double parked), neighborhood resident vehicles double parked for alternate side of the street parking rules, massive student and parent foot traffic along with the customary area foot and vehicle traffic made for a very chaotic and potentially dangerous situation for our children.  Principal Hoke, Mrs. Collins, Ms. Rizzuto and  Mr. Lehman did an admirable job keeping our children safe and out of harms way.   There were some impatient motorists who refused to adhere to the NY State Vehicle and Traffic Law that requires motorists to halt for a school bus with red signal lights flashing while loading or discharging passengers.  Principal Hoke did have words with one of these motorists, but there was no banging on car hoods or anything out of the ordinary. \n\nLet us focus on the strides made at 282, the positive change in tone of the building, the academic and extracurricular success amongst the student body.   This school has a Chess program with multiple individual and team National Championships, a Rugby program with multiple City Championships in the elementary and middle school divisions, 89% of 8th grade students passing the NYS Common Core Algebra Regents and a dedicated faculty. \n\nThis school isn't perfect, and yes there is room for improvement, but baseless and slanderous statements have no place in this forum or in this school.  My child is moving on to high school and I am, for the most part, pleased with he education received at this institution.  I look forward to hearing nothing but positive things about this school.  \n\nDonate to make 282 great!\n\nhttp://282parkslope.com/282/fundraising/"", ""Unfortunately the details here are not accurate. On the last day of school, there were several cars that blocked the bus parking in front of 282. This created an unsafe situation for students who had to walk into the street to enter the bus. PD was called and staff redirected cars so students were not in harms way. Several people observed a silver sedan run over an orange cone and come within inches of the principal. The principal and the motorist exchanged words however there was no banging on the car of any sort. Simply untrue as the car was never touched. In fact, the car drove through the street while students were boarding the bus. \n\nIn terms of bullying, 282 has provided a safe space for parents to voice their concerns. With that said, consequences for bullying and other offenses  are determined by the DOE's investigative process and the disciplinary code. Adults are not permitted to threaten young children with physical violence as retribution to claims of bullying or dictate consequences when these claims are unsubstantiated. \n\n\n"", 'PS/MS 282 students win a national chess championship.

They have created a developmentally nurturing yet academically rigorous environment for the students and work hard to meet each child's individual needs. My child is always excited to go to school and cries when school is closed. My child is always sharing new information learned at school with me. Another reason I chose 307 was because they offer Mandarin in PreK and it will continue as students move into Kindergarten.

When I ask him to describe his school he says that it's a warm and supportive environment.  He has a great group of friends and peers that we feel very good about and the school spends a TON of time on social-emotional skills we believe every pre-teen needs.  We don't have a student in the ASD program, but our son indicates they have a lot of interaction with the other students.  It seems to us that the presence of the ASD students lend to the supportive and accepting social environment among the students.  As a parent, I would describe the school as having clear expectations and being disciplined while expressing care, joy and love for the students.\n\nThe school works tirelessly to create connections with the industries that surround the school - and those partnerships are still gelling into something sustainable.  Off the top of my head, I've known the kids to work with Flocabulary, St. Ann's Warehouse, Tech in the Navy Yard, Etsy headquarters.\n\nThe academics are solid and kids get both their science and math regents before graduating if they qualify to take the test which is very important to be on track to take high level math and science in high school.\n\nIt goes without saying that the arts are a big focus.  Each student surveys the four arts majors in 6th grade before focusing in on drama, visual arts, music, or dance.  We do wish there were an established instrumental program at the school - but understand the school is slowly starting up programs as their approach is to get something right rather than start more programs at once than they can execute to their standards.  The school has obtained instruments and hopes to start an instrumental program soon.\n\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE that they understand what is needed for high school admissions and they start working with the students to prepare for applications in 7th grade, which includes SHSAT prep, portfolio and audition preparation for arts schools, and informing students of their grade and attendance responsibilities in 7th grade.  To our mind, it helps even the playing field when the school does this job rather than assuming parents are aware of how the process works.\n\nParents at the school are very active and the Principal is receptive to feedback, ideas, and help.  The school is still very new and there are the expected bumps in the road that come along with it.

I also feel that the school should enforce a 'NO TOLERANCE' policy for students with behavioral concerns as this is supposed to be a selective school.

I feel that the school should be more diverse."", ""As a parent in District 13, I struggled to find a high-quality middle school for my son. I wanted both a challenging academic curriculum as well as a small and warm environment that would provide emotional support to help my son succeed. When I discovered the  Dock Street School,I jumped to register my son.\n\nThe school has been a breath of fresh air. To my son, the school is more than just a school, it is a community. All the children are friends with each other and all the children know all the teachers. There are a multitude of after-school programs that are offered to students free-of-charge.\nWhile my son is still undecided, I'm rooting for the dance and drama program. \n\nThe school also offers each student the ability to choose their own arts major. The choices for art majors are music, drama, dance and fine arts. During sixth grade, students experience all the different art majors. This allows our children to understand that they have a choice in their education and their future profession. The teachers are eminently qualified and make sure that the classes are both educational and enjoyable. My son loves his math and ELA teachers. Each day, he tells me what he learned without me prompting him. It's remarkable to have my pre-teen so excited about a class - especially in the hard sciences!\n\nDock Street is an improvement from Satellite West. A new set of parents arrived with the new building and the school culture has shifted as well. I'm part of the new wave of engaged and vocal parents. We are dedicated to having our children succeed beyond their wildest expectations and we are lucky the administration is so receptive to us.

This school is deliberately out of compliance with every special education law. The ICT classroom has too many students with IEPs to meet the legal requirements for ICT and the special education teacher is not present for most of their academic classes so they do not receive their mandated services. This is against the law. Dr Vaughn the principal made the decision to pull out the paraprofessional from the autism classroom for two days a week for several months which violated all of the students IEPs - illegal. The former sat west special education teachers including myself have not received training in IEPs and our IEPs are out of compliance. Parents do not receive updates even though their scholars IEPs say they should. An autistic child was restrained in a very dangerous manner for over 20 minutes for yelling about paper by a paraprofessional with no restraint training. This is illegal and dangerous. Nobody with deescalation training including his teacher was allowed to intervene or assist. The parents were not told because they are wealthy and vocal backers of Dr Vaugn. This is also a violation of special education law. Dr Vaugn screams at the students and teachers and creates fear and shame. The younger teachers work very hard but some of the older teachers I've had to work with sit at their desk blocked by flowers and play puzzle games on their phones while the students run loose like crazy. There is no physical (materials) or emotional support for teachers or students and teachers are expected to stay late multiple nights in a row and perform miracles. \nI'm glad I'm leaving. Seeing a disabled child carried down the hall and restrained for simply screaming about paper in such a way that both his shoulders could have been dislocated and seeing that no one with training was allowed to intervene to deescalate the situation, plus overhearing the student's teacher told not to contact the parents - that was the last broken law for me.\nDock Street is not a safe school and it's principal, Dr Vaugn, does not care about making it safer. She only cares about money and her special visitor guests like the superintendent.

After an awful 5th grade experience at my son's previous public school, my family explored every educational setting in New York City, including private schools.  We were slated to go to a private school this year but when we met Dr. Melissa Vaughan, her transformational leadership and compassion blew us away.  The Dock Street School has changed my son's life.  Ms. Goldstein, my son's 6th grade teacher, should absolutely win teacher of the year award.  In addition to her pedagogical expertise, Ms. Goldstein is a passionate educator who cares so deeply about each of her students and believes in their ability to succeed not just in school, but in life. She sees potential and strengths in each student, and work with parents and her school team (especially Mr. Xaiver) to develop strategies around areas that need improvement.

We addressed it again and thought it was over, until my son said the bully was still harassing him and threatening  him. The leadership from the Principal down seems to me inadequate. I will give Credit to Mr. Hastings for trying to squash this problem, but it just seems that  it was never communicated to the Principal Melissa Vaughn. In fact the Principal is often not visible within the school. It is very unfortunate that it has come to the point that I am now removing my son from the Dock Street school.

However, they serve the whitest and wealthiest population in the district along with PS 8, Compass, and Brooklyn Prospect.  In this time of self- examination and dismantling racial injustice, I would like to make a few suggestions.\n\nIn the so-called ""merger"" with PS 305, I think it\'s important for A&L to examine how this will feel to PS 305 families.  \n-Why can\'t the new school be named some more identifying with the building they are taking over?  How will it feel to have the school named for the whiter and more affluent school?\n-Why is A&L clinging to their old admissions system - lottery - when they are moving into a zone building?  Why can\'t it just be the new zone admissions?  Are kids from 305\'s zone really that much of a threat to A&L\'s identity and success?  Is it acceptable that after three years families who have attended 305 for generations will suddenly be rezoned to make way for a different demographic?  Talk about colonizing.\n-Why is A&L free lunch preference only 40% in a district with a k-8 free lunch population around 65%?  And even then, only attracts a population that is 22% free lunch.  Is this because they don\'t have an honest lottery or because they don\'t do outreach to attract applicants?  Either way, it is A&L\'s responsibility to fix this.\n-If the school wants to be intentionally diverse, they can add preferences for children in foster care, children with incarcerated parents, NYCHA residents, homeless and doubled up children.\n-Why does the school SCREEN the handful of kids admitted for middle school?  Why is this not a lottery now - and why won\'t it be preference to 305\'s zone moving forward followed by the preferences listed above?\n\nEnough is enough with this resource hoarding.  A public school should be able to teach ALL children - and should WANT to.  It should WANT to reflect the community in which it is located.  It should NOT want to take over another zone and push those families to other schools.\n\nDo better Arts & Letters.  Stop calling yourself intentionally diverse while you continually take over long standing school buildings in the area and make them islands of privilege on the backs of the families who built the community you are joining.  Stop having your students continually talk about equality and inclusivity - stop having your students stage protests while hoarding every resource for them.

I have gotten a great education, but others might not agree. The teachers don\'t tend to give their attention to each student equally. They don\'t give attention to the kids who overall do well in school and are well behaved. The school gives a lot more praise to the kids who don\'t do well and act up. Each week they give a bracelet to celebrate a student from each grade. They only give bracelets to the kids who are bad and do one good thing as opposed to the kids who are good all the time. For example this one student would bully people, act disruptive, and regularly make racist comments to students of certain races, would get a bracelet around 3 times a year for being good in one class. This is kind of giving the message ""If you act up you get love and praise and if you do well you are ignored"". There is also a small bit of sexism, for example, halfway through the year only two girls in my grade got bracelets. The staff is amazing about teaching about different races and cultures but never really talk about sexism. This leads to many students believing that it doesn\'t exist and will commonly do sexist things towards the girls. The staff have good intentions and plans, but don\'t really execute it well. The staff is caring and always make you feel safe. There are many at lunch office hours in my grade, so if you need extra help you can go. My grade is pretty diverse. I would say it is mostly black and white, there are few hispanics and probably only 3 or 4 asians in the grade. I have noticed that as the grades get younger, the less diverse they are. I have a younger sibling in the elementary school, and you can tell her class has way more white people than any other race. The kindergarten has very few POC in it. This is not really something the school can control, but it is just a heads up to incoming families. I have noticed that the principal is reluctant to solve problems that students bring up. For example some girls asked that there would be free feminine products in the bathrooms. He refused and told them that you would have to go to the office or the nurses office, which are both on completely different floors from the middle school. Overall this school excels academically and feels very safe, but has some issues.', 'I am going into 8th high school next year, and I’ve been at Arts and Letters since kindergarten. Arts and letters has become a large part of me. There are downsides and upsides to this school, but the great thing about this school is that it has a strong community. \nLet’s start with the principal. Mr. O’Reilly cares very much about diversity and making the school a good experience of learning and growth. However, he doesn’t always manage or execute it well. \nThe teachers at Arts and Letters are very committed, kind and smart. For the most part, they push us in our work. The middle school especially is very challenging, and has been a great academic experience for me. They offer many after school activities such as debate team, chess team, newspaper club, basketball, etc. \nThe lower grades are slightly less challenging, but still great as it lets you work at your own pace and builds your social skills. The middle school also prepares us very well for high school. \nI haven’t experienced or seen much physical bullying at this school, but some students can be mean, as some kids are.\nThe teachers handle any altercations pretty seriously and pretty well, but when the administration gets involved sometimes the process to solving the problem can get drawn out. I definitely feel safe at the school, and I think the majority of students would agree with me. Sometimes the administration focuses on and celebrates the students who act out more than the students who are consistently good, and sometimes that can hurt, but I understand that they must reward their behavior more since it is rarer. \n\nOverall, I am very grateful for Arts and Letters and all it has done for me. It is a school that will leave an everlasting positive experience on me. Although I am sad to go, I feel that it has prepared me for highschool, and I can’t wait to apply everything it has taught me to the real world.', ""My child is in their first year in K there and we've had an incredibly positive experience.  The two K teachers are wonderful - kind and fun and aways coming up with interesting ways to engage the kids in school (for example, a recent tree and plant study was meant to be kept a 'secret' from parents until a class presentation, and the kids loved gossiping about photosynthesis just out of their parents hearing).  Our main focus was a kindergarten experience where our child would continue to be excited about school and learning and most importantly, have a lot of time to play, and Arts & Letters has really met our expectations.  There's a big focus on social-emotional learning and while reading and math are introduced, it's at an age appropriate level (I don't love the push to teach K students to read).  We'd of course love things like foreign language and music instruction, but they do have plenty of arts classes, movement and gym 1x a week each, and outdoor classroom 1 morning a week.

Overall Arts and Letters has many benefits, including being progressive, racially diverse and having a great principal who keeps the community close, although they fail to meet education (academics and art classes) standards. The academics issue is caused by lack of preparation (which is the case because they want to have a more loose, hands-on, progressive teaching method, although I think they could do that and keep us up to par) and students being ""babied"".

They do not rely on the school solely for their childs education because know if they do their children would be unsuccessful.

The two main ones are YMCA (they pick up, bring kids to the Java St Early Ed center, 6pm pick up), or WMAAC (on-site at school, 5:30 pick up, i believe). There are other neighborhood programs that pick up (ballet, martial arts etc). You can find details on these programs on the PS 31 PTA site, i believe.', 'I have a first grader at PS31. We absolutely love our school! This year my child has a lot of creative enrichment courses. She had ballet in class with WMAAC with a recital. Art instruction in the school art room with Eckford Street Studio (a locally run art program). She is also expected to have keyboard lessons in the music room as well as chorus. \n\nThe new science wing upstairs is beautiful! Children get to use electron microscopes, and do experiments. There is also a “Green” science room with a hydroponic garden where the children learn about the environment. \n\nSince beginning in Pre-K, my child has grown so much. She is responsible, caring, helpful and respectful. Homework is not an issue, I don’t have to push the topic. She understands that she has a certain amount every day and takes the initiative to do it herself! (!!!!) \n\nWe love PS 31, the staff is so caring and thoughtful. I swear every staff member knows my child’s name. \nThey work very hard to make the school a happy and safe environment for all of the students.', ""I just wanted to chime in here and let other parents know more about the school in case they're considering it. \n\nAs a former student of PS 31 and now mom of a 3 and 5 year-old, I am very familiar with the school. When I enrolled my daughter in Pre-K in 2006, I had some reservations because my experience as a former student in 1981 had not been very good. However, after visiting the school, meeting some of the staff and learning about the school's more recent reputation, I decided to give it a try. My five-year-old is now in Kindergarten, and I plan on enrolling my three-year-old into the Pre-K program in 2018. \n\nWhat I like about P.S. 31, aside from the rich community of involved parents and the nurturing teachers and staff, is the organization. The flow of communication is constant and easy to understand. We also have direct communication with teachers via an app. In addition, the school has a fairly well developed app that helps parents stay informed on a daily and weekly basis. \n\nI know some parents prefer a lighter touch on academics at this early age, but I don't mind it at all. You have to know your child and your own preferences for how they spend their academic time. My five-year-old is already accustomed to homework and routine testing, but she is experiencing those requirements in a way that is fun and encouraging. Sometimes, as parents we have reservations because we associate stress with test taking, but from my point of view, the sooner children are exposed to it, the better. \n\nLastly, I would say what helps the school stand out is the programs they have available. As Jennie Stoneburner Ward noted, there are rich programs available in: art, music, science and even movement. I am really pleased with how they are exposing children to leadership both in how they behave and approach life (The Leader in Me Program) and the Green Eco-Friendly training that will help make them responsible social stewards in the future."", 'Hi! I am the PTA co-President at P.S. 31 and would love for you to visit again. Though academics are still very strong here at P.S. 31, I wouldn\'t say ""old-fashioned"" values rule the day quite so much anymore. We are really moving forward with the times and have done some amazing things with our school. We\'re still a Blue Ribbon School with an award-winning chess program, but here are some ways we\'ve changed.\n\nWe have a PTA that is growing stronger and raising more money for arts and other enrichment each year. We have a Fall Festival, a Spring Gala, a holiday show for the students, several fundraisers, and are adding many events this year. Stay tuned for those (one in January/February), a likely spring musical this year too!!\n\nWe have a full-time physical education teacher who works with each class in a gym TWICE a week. We have recess other days and walks around the block for different grades. There\'s Go Noodle movement activity in the classroom and WMAAC provides dance movement for grades 1-5. We just applied for and were accepted into the NYRR Kids Movement Program as well, which provides 400 unique activities for the physical educator to use during the school day and incentives and races for students and families to take part in after school and on weekends, with free bussing. \n\nA huge thing several years ago was that picture day was on Halloween. Its not anymore. The children dress up for halloween now!!\n\nWe have a Sustainability Coach through Eco Schools who is running a Green Wellness Team to bring positive physical movement, healthy eating, and general well-being to the school through the lens of sustainability.\n\nLunch time is wonderful, and the kids talk and enjoy themselves as kids are supposed to do! :D', 'A second-grade class at PS 31 have won a trip to Universal Studios through a <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-students-win-news-annual-universal-orlando-contest-article-1.2630420"">NY Daily News competition</a>.', 'Fines from the notorious Greenpoint oil spill in Brooklyn will fund a new Greenpoint-Eco Schools program to teach kids about environmental conservation in four Brooklyn schools, including PS 31.

YES this school was super strict but it was also immensely rewarding and installed a very old school sense of pride, self responsibility, manners, morals, and standards. My classmates are incredibly successful and intelligent people today and I give most of the credit to PS31. Those early formative years where we were held to an extremely high standard gave us an immense sense of pride when our hard work paid off as well as humility when we didn't perform . From day 1 we were taught to sit up straight, exercise self control  & give undivided attention; to respect authority,each other, and most importantly ourselves. Addressing the cheating accusations I can say 1st hand that this is something I NEVER experienced in my 8 years there. We were drilled and even had classes on test taking tactics (how to remain alert and calm under pressure, and how to make the best decisions possible based on the info we were given) To this day I still score exceptionally well on tests and work well under pressure.

Our boys are now in Kindergarten and Pre-K, and when we started the school hunt 3 years ago, beginning the North Brooklyn tour circuit in Greenpoint, this was the 3rd one we visited and instantly knew it was the place for our kids. A year and a half later, first hand experience has proven that our little school is so special because it fosters an environment that supports creativity and academic rigor, where concepts are learned and applied even the in the youngest grades instead of just stressing memorization and test prep, and play, physical movement and student engagement is highly valued. From the top down, the administration creates a culture where every student is important and students respect and know one another across the grades. My kids play with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders after school and it always catches me by surprise when a 4th or 5th grader says hello to one of them by name. Most importantly, the teachers are exceptional. In addition to being extraordinary educators they are all caring, engaged, and nurturing. And this goes for the rest of the staff as well. The children at PS 34 are genuinely loved, and they feel it. My kids’ happiness at going to school everyday is proof!\n\nOther things that make PS 34 a wonderful place to go to school:\n\nPS 34 is the only elementary school in Greenpoint that has a full time art teacher, two gym teachers, and a new state of the art STEM lab equipped with hydroponic systems provided by a $250,000.00 participatory budget grant with the help of the school’s amazing PTA. \n\nArt and creativity are highly valued throughout the school. At the end of the year there is a Student Art Expo where every student in the school has at least one work of art on display. The past two years it’s been held at the Brooklyn Expo Center. There is also the annual art parade where students dress as their favorite artist or favorite work of art, and process through the school yard! Also art related, the awesome parents at PS 34 have come together over the past few years to organize the school’s biggest fundraiser of the year - The Art Party - auctioning art generously donated by local artists. All money raised provides funding for most of the enrichments in the school including additional art classes for the lower grades, music for every student, theater and puppet production, animation classes, Lego Robotics, and more.\n\nEven though the school has to be creative with space, kids have recess and gym throughout the week. Pre-k kids have 45 minutes of outside play EVERYDAY. Kindergarteners have lunch recess indoors everyday after they clean up their meals in the cafeteria, at least 2-3 recess periods outside per week, and 2 gym periods a week with one of the gym teachers. The other grades go outside 2 times a week and have gym or movement classes 2 times a week as well. The school is also slated to receive a gym as a part of a citywide initiative with construction scheduled to begin as early as this fall.\n\nThe STEM lab which is fully functional this year and has hydroponic equipment, works in conjunction with our eco sustainability program. Among the many things they learn in STEM, kids participate and are engaged in problem solving activities such as exploring and understanding environmental issues, and then are encouraged to think of solutions. Also, part of the eco program, is an interior courtyard that will be converted into an outdoor classroom ready for use early in the 2018/2019 school year, and will give teachers the opportunity to instruct in fresh air.\n\nI literally could go on and on about why my family is so happy at PS 34. When we entered the public school system, I never could have imagined we would be this happy. The bottom line is that PS 34 is a wonderful community school with great families and experienced engaged teachers, that encourages creativity, and is rigorous academically in a supportive nurturing environment. Stop by and check it out!', ""PS 34 is a great little school. I have two kids there and they love it. The school encourages critical thinking, creativity, and independent thought in the students. The kids do well on standardized tests, but the school doesn't stress them at all. PS 34 has a significant about of families that opt out of the tests. The administration knows every child in the school and really encourages their development and confidence. There is a really strong sense of school community. They really encourage parental involvement and inter-grade interactions. There are tons of really amazing enrichments, from art to dance to music to robotics. We couldn't be happier at the school!"", ""PS 34 is a close-knit, warm and nurturing school. The students are really happy and the PTA supports great art, music, and dance enrichments.

14K084,"['The 5th grade science teacher told my son last Friday to ""go hang himself"" in front of the entire class. I contacted the assistant principal, Ms. Hernandez, to schedule a conversation about the incident via Bloomz and have received no response 5 days later. My son\'s mother went into the school and was told the incident did occur and the situation has been escalated to the board of education... really frustrating.', 'Did they ever address this? Was this teacher disciplined in any way?', 'My son was at this school for K through 2nd grade and I have since learned he is dyslexic, but his teachers at PS84 were evasive about discussing his issues, even when we asked for help. The school social worker told us that they did not want to assess him for an IEP because they ""have quotas and are encouraged not to do assessments.""  I feel like a fool for trusting the people at this school for 3 years, during which time he could have been getting the help he needed if he had been properly assessed. I only learned later that if I had stated my request in writing they would have been required to perform the assessment. Overall, I got the feeling that the teachers are afraid of the principal and that she undermines their ability to act in the best interests of their students.', ""This school is amazing. At first there was some concern with the amount of kids i noticed who had a potty mouth but that is not a reflection on the school. My 11 year old who is new to this school for 6th grade was hesitant but by the 2nd week she absolutely loves it.  The teachers are amazing, the principal and the asst principal are truly dedicated and love the kid s.  The school is clean and safe.  The curriculum teaches the kids not only to be responsible but to be organized and plan ahead.  They all have an organizer which they write down what they do for the day or reminder.  They all have lockers and there is a structure for changing classes and even during lunch.  The older kids do not mix with the younger kids so that is amazing as sometimes when you put them all together causes issues.   The Dean Mr. Combs truly does care about the kids and anytime you bring something to his attention there is no delay in addressing it the same goes for the rest of the staff OUR kids are a priority!  \n\nThe rooftop classroom is just amazing! The students learn about how to harvest the food they grow there and how to take care of them.  They have live Tilapia in a tank that actually help the plants grow WHO KNEW!!! The school has a diverse group of students which is a beautiful thing to see and when class is in session or even when it's time to switch classroom you would never think that there are students here.  The principal sits on the 3rd floor and is visible throughout the building, you never see her in the office because she is literally on every floor.  There is always an adult presence on every floor and the kids are very respectful.  You know the school is meant for success when the entire staff including the principal and the asst. principal know each child by their names and most importantly that the children address the adults accordingly.  Yes,  you have a few students who try to do the back talk or get out of line but the staff is always there to address it accordingly.  \n\nThis school is going to be a huge success.  It is a safe place where you can walk away knowing your child is safe and no matter what happens the staff will take care of things.  I give this school a 20 if I could!!! Great job Jose de Diego!!"", 'We have been sending our kids to PS 84 for a few years now and we have seen the school grow and expand in leaps and bounds. The principal works closely with the PTA to create enrichment programs so all students learn more than just reading and math skills. Test scores do not accurately reflect the robust curriculum and progressive education PS84 students are receiving. Parents feel welcome in the school by visiting their child\'s classroom once a month for ""Wonderful Wednesdays."" Parents can also volunteer in the school to become Learning Leaders so they can help out in the Library, Cafeteria or Materials Room. There feels like a true partnership between home and school at PS84. \n\nHere are some things that set our school apart from others: \nPS 84 Jose de Diego is a public school for the Visual Arts & Sciences\n\n1-Rooftop Greenhouse Classrooom (1st classroom of it\'s kind in all of \nBrooklyn) Our very own Greenmarket using kale, lettuces, herbs etc the \nstudents harvest from the Greenhouse. Amazing flavor with no pesticides \nor dirt!\n\n2-Strong sense of community and a PTA that successfully raises $80-100K a year towards enrichment programs.\n\n3-Dedicated Enrichment teachers: 2 Art Teachers, 4 Science Teachers, 2 \nMusic Teachers, 1 Technology Teacher, 2 PhysEd teachers, 1 Spanish \nTeacher (in addition to all the Bilingual DL Teachers)\n\n4-Dual Language English/Spanish program from K-5th grade with plans to expand into middle school\n\n5-Middle School- Your child can start in PreK and finish in 8th grade all at one local school\n\n6-Science Exploratorium: 1st school in NYC to modernize the traditional \nScience Fair and see students as ""explainers"" of science.\n\n7-Experienced teachers of 25 years teach beside brand new teachers. A \ndiverse group of individuals mixed by race, gender and age.\n\n8-ASD NEST program for students on the Autism Spectrum. School has an inclusive culture where all students learn, socialize and create side by side.\n\n9-Low Student:Teacher Ratio- No class has more than 25 students.\n\n10-Dedicated parents who work with school administrators to create fabulous school events all year long! International Night, Family Photo Day, Gala & Silent Auction, Artstravaganza, Science Exploratorium, Garden Party and much more!\n\n\nThere are SO many more things to brag about but I do think it is important to \ncheck it out yourself and make your own impressions. Come visit us in the Fall and take a tour!', ""I agree with everything you wrote here, I'm late in the game to review this but now that my daughter is here I can honestly say it has lived up to everything I had hoped it would be.  It is a hidden gem that has the foundation of what ALL schools should be like.  The principal, staff are simply the best and the rooftop classroom is something I have never seen at any other school. The school thrives to honestly show the students that this goes beyond just the books they teach the students about LIFE and the appreciation of it most importantly how to respect the differences in each other which is a huge KUDOS especially when the media paints a different picture.  Our kids are destined for greatness here!"", ""Our family has been at P.S. 84 for 4 years and we've found it overall to be a very positive, encouraging and loving educational environment. The teachers care. The administration cares. The principal cares. There is an outstanding music teacher and the rooftop garden is a wonderful new resource. No school is perfect, but when you can start by having a true, good and honest heart -- which is what the teachers and administration of P.S. 84 have -- it trumps everything else and is a rare thing that should be appreciated and to be grateful for."", ""I consider my family to be incredibly fortunate to be part of this vibrant, diverse school! Year in, year out, my children have had excellent, dedicated, empathetic teachers who have taken the time to get to know my kids as individuals as well as learners. My children are in the dual language program - learning to speak, read, write, and think in two languages, benefit from top-notch visual arts and music programs, explore a wide range of sciences in the hydroponic rooftop greenhouse, learn computer coding, participate in terrific arts residencies, and more! \n\n  As a parent, I have always felt welcome in the school. PS 84 offers monthly open classroom sessions called Wonderful Wednesday which help me stay connected to my children's learning. I love the schoolwide celebrations of student learner - International Night, Artstravaganza, Science Exploratorium, and musical performances throughout the school year. In my experience, parents are welcome to volunteer at the school. Learning Leaders run the school's library, help with lunch, and do so much more! The PTA has many committees that work with teachers to support learning, bring new ideas, and make amazing things happen for all kids.

14K318,"['Hi! For any incoming students, I can answer some of your questions. I am currently in 8th grade (2019-2020) and graduating this year to go to high school. Here is a brief overview(feel free to ask questions if you are unsure of anything):\n\n There are regular classes and advanced classes, you will most likely have some different teachers if you are in a advanced class rather than in a regular class. Although I think they took away advanced classes for 6th grade, they still apply for 7th and 8th. Keep in mind, even if advanced classes got taken away for 6th your class still might have a reputation. \nAdvanced Classes (I will use the 8th grade classes for reference):\n804, 806, 808, 810, 812\nRegular Classes:\n801, 802, 803, 805, 807, 809, 811, 813\n Your class will probably not change. You will stay in one class with the same people and move to different rooms for each subject(math, since, etc.) Your class can change depending on your grades. For example, I am in and advanced class, 806. I have been in 806 for the three years I’ve attended 318 and I am very familiar with my classmates and I have made friends because it’s the same people. But there have been people that have gone from 806 to 813 regarding their grades. To be in an advanced class, a lot is expected. You must maintain AT LEAST an 85% for each class at the end of each marking period. While that is true, if you would like to be in an advanced class and you are not, you must have top grades and maybe have a talk with your dean. Advanced classes can get competitive, but overall, they are pretty friendly. We do get more work and are very much advanced in the curriculum compared to regular classes. You also have to take somer regent tests.\n For a regular class, I think you must maintain a 75% percent for each class or you will fail that class, and that is not beneficial. It can mess up your high school results and limit you opportunities. \n If you have any academic questions, feel free to ask.\n\nCLUBS/ACTIVITIES\n In sixth grade you will have a shop, which can be photography, art, rock band, band, chess, etc.\nYou can change your shop(that will be a little bit more difficult with band or chess) if you talk to Ms. Santamaria. You should probably do this in the beginning of the year because there might be less seats for the shop you was to be in later on. In seventh grade you will also get a talent, which is kind of like another shop class. There are also after school activities, such as dance, rock band, beginner band, robotics, AV, sports, and more. You will get a list explaining that in the beginning of the school year.\n Regarding lunch, it is 45 minutes, so is every other period. We do not have recess because our lunch period is pretty long. The cafeteria gets pretty loud sometimes. We sit with our class and it’s divided by gender. For example you would sit with the GIRLS in your class if you are a girl. If you have friends in other classes, you might be able to sit with them if you are sneaky, but if they are the opposite gender, forget about it. \n\nSTUDENT LIFE:\n As for my experience, it was okay. I love being in an advanced class because I feel like I’m learning daily and I get along with the kids in my class because we have the same passion to stay ahead. I had Mr. Healy for rock band in 6th and 7th and he was overall pretty fun but he got annoyed sometimes. \n Hallways can get pretty crowded, you just have to get used to it and learn to navigate. There are three floors and a basement(where the gym and auditorium are located) and 3 main staircases. One is used to go up and the other two can be used to go up or down. When the bell rings, try to use the right staircases for the right direction. In between classes, to go to the bathroom or whatnot, you can basically use any staircase since it’s not crowded. \n AS for the students, most are pretty okay. There will always be students who don’t care or are problematic, and I’ve seen my share of fights. Try not to get involved with those situations because it will not go well. Specialized/Advanced classes have the best students when it comes to learning, in my opinion. Most students are friendly, there are the occasional clowns or students that are disrespectful, but they are everywhere. Overall 318 is pretty chill. We do have a dress code and there are certain teachers that aren’t the best. If you happen to get Ms. Kessler, Mr. Karpieszuck(?), Ms. Renkas, Mr. Tietze, Ms. Torres, and mr. Sciame, you’re bound to have a good learning experience. Especially Ms. Kessler!\nALSO PLEASE TRY TO GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH PREPARING FOR HIGH SCHOOL, IT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL LATER ON, TRUST ME!\n Regarding the dress code, it can be pretty strict. There are no rips in jeans  above the knee but you might get away with it depending on how big the rips are. If you wear big earrings, you will probably be told to take them off. You could get away with some crop tops as long as they aren’t too “revealing”. You can wear high heels, although I don’t recommend it. You can also wear dresses and skirts that are below the knee. Anything above the knee will only be permitted towards the end of the year. \n This is all pretty vague so if you have an questions please ask. I have to do my work now so I can’t talk about everything but I hope this helped.', 'I used to go to 318 until I transferred. The only thing that I miss was the dance team because I got really attached to the dance teacher and she taught me a lot of things that I will always keep in my heart. I love you Ms. Barretta you’re the best and I miss your dance classes. Other than that I would never go back to 318, I would prefer 577 better because that make you feel at home and you don’t get bullied like you do in 318.I love you guys but right now I am 577 bears 🐻 forever🤞🏾 .😢🙁🥺😶', ""Honestly I'm a 8th grader right now in this school (2018-19) and the school's policies are outdated, they are on the more traditional side.

For example Mr.illipoulious is a math teacher in the 7th grade he is not too patient, and if your kid doesn't work well in fast paced classes, it's better to make them switch classes. There are a bunch of good teachers here like ms. Vindigni, ms. Kessler, mr. sciame and more. The after school programs are good and so are the shop classes. The main thing I recommend for this school is just be respectful, try to make some friends and work hard because this school offers highschool stuff that can help you out. Also don't be afraid to talk with some 8th graders if your lost or need help a lot of us are willing to help if you aren't trying to act tuff or something like that"", 'Hmm, you have Ms. Kessler and Mr. Sciame? I had them when I was in 8th grade. But, I had Mr. Sciame since 6th grade.', ""For the most part the school teachers are truly wonderful. The administration on the other hand has a serious problem of understanding and managing bullying situations and tends to go for a cover up rather than actually deal with the problem. Especially so when it comes to the idolized band teacher, Mr Walid (Willy) Hakim who notoriously abusive to students and is protected by school leadership. If your kid is at risk of being bullied, you better reconsider your choice when it comes to this school. Having said that, academically it's a great school and as said, has wonderful teachers (except for the terrible Walid Hakim)"", 'Hello, another thing that makes this school great is that they offer a 6th grade SHSAT pilot program, 7th grade SHSAT summer program, and the DREAM program.

I'm graduating too this year"", ""I think that the way people view the school differs from person to person, so I´m going to give everyone a summary of the school that most students or former students would agree with. It´s a great school, but only on one side of it. On one side, there are the SP students, or advanced placement students. We are usually OK, do well academically , and get along with the teachers. (sometimes we may be little annoying) But on the other hand, there are there are the non- SP classes. People who go there either just struggle in school, which is fine, that´s just them, but the other type of non-SP kid makes up what I absolutely hate about this school. They are the rude morons that don´t even try at school and spend all their time just being a general nuisance to both the students and teachers. Sadly, these people make up a good 30% of the school, and even if they aren´t in the same class as you, you still encounter them. They are the ones who cause most of the problems at our school, like our struggling REGENTS scores, the constant fights at Lindsey Park, the bullying, the drugs and vaping, and the ridiculously strict rules that are aimed at them but end up affecting everyone. And that´s just to name a couple. Some other things about the school I don´t like too much is the attitude and rudeness of some of the security guards and other staff, the crowded hallways and sometimes dangerous hallways, the way our grading system works on Jupiter Grades, and the disgusting dirtiness of some places in the school, like the boys bathrooms and locker room. However, to end my summary, I´ll tell you some of the upsides of the school. There are many clubs where you can find people who like the same things and make friends, including the famous band and chess club. (The prime minister of Norway came to visit the chess time, in 2016)  Other good things about the school are the teachers, which a good 85% of them are nice, the academics, our big gym and auditorium, the fact that we have the whole building of three floors to ourself, the cultural blend, and finally, the easiness of finding friends among the 1,600 kids who go here. Overall, I will graduate this year with a pretty good memory of the school. A final comment is that even though our school has many flaws, I can honestly tell you from the information I've gotten from friends who go to other schools that our school is considerably better than most of the other ones in the area. (psst by the way DON'T go to MS 577)"", ""Ok, so I have read the comments and half of them are true, and the other half is false. The teachers are great here, that's a start. I have made ALOT of new friends in this school which is also a plus. The highschool help is really helpful and the teachers try their best to make the students feel welcome. However, there are kids that have started fights, and this school makes really unnecessary rules, such as no hoodies or no arizona bottles. But those restrictions just stay around for a year, and for the next year, it's fine. I know alot of people that went here, and they were satisfied. I'm graduating this year (2017) and I will miss my friends and teachers. Don't listen to the people saying that someone brought in a knife or something like that.

She told me she was going to fix the problem, and i saw that the problem wasn't over. So I head to the teachers and the principal and nothing solved. They announced that any student who misbehave will be transfer to another classroom (regular class). But then they want me an A student to be transfer, this is unfair. I found out they are coward and ineptitude and will always be. But though I had accepted it, at the same time it was unfair also. To those people who wrote their comments about their child's bad experienced in this school, I must say it is true. As a mother or father, I wouldn't let a child be in that school where they will be no education for their future, this will be a ruin for a child's dream.

Overall, we have been very happy with the school with some important caveats. The quality of the main classroom teachers is generally very solid. We have twins that were always in separate classes, so we got to see a good window into the school's offerings. The quality of teachers ranged from excellent to middling. We definitely got a few dud teachers that made us feel that one of our kids was getting the short end of the stick certain years, but in the end all was well. The school's main weakness is in its enrichment curriculum (art, science, gym, etc). At no point did we feel that the kids were getting even a decent education in these fields. Science was a major letdown, with the quality of instruction quite basic and teachers failing to inspire even the most cursory interest in the subject. This was particularly painful for me, for whom science is a favorite subject. My kids came out of the school without a grounding in the subject, let alone a love for it. Major disappointment and a major failing on the part of the science teachers, who need to move on. Music was similarly uninspired. Your students will seemingly be learning the recorder for 6 years straight with very little progress. The school could really use some music education differentiation, with orchestral and band instruments. Again, a failure on the part of the admin and music teacher. Gym deserves very little  mention as the most we typically heard about gym was the degree of yelling of the instructors.\n\nAll that sound very negative and serious, and it is and should be remedied, but elementary school is about so much more.

It is a warm welcoming community in my experience. This school is very accommodating to everyone because it is designed for kids with all different levels of learning. However I would recommend not signing up for the G&T program. It might seem tempting to be able to call your kid ""Gifted and talented"" but I think you will regret this decision, if you want a good experience jut go to general ed or check a different school. The main problem at this school stems from division between general ed and g&t. As for the Nest program, it is great, your kids will learn a lot in this program, feel comfortable at the school, and still be with general ed kids. However there is a lot of secrecy surrounding Nest that needs to end, ppl need to stop pretending like Nest doesn\'t exist. Everyone knows about it so might as well talk about it, it will make things easier and stop ppl from making wrong conclusions. Some kids in Nest don\'t even know that Nest exists and they are in it!

Insideschools, I encourage you to revisit and update your review of this school. The middle school is no longer there, and the afterschool program has been restructured. I'm sure the survey results can use some updating as well."", 'Important updates: \n1) There’s no big yard at the moment, because a massive expansion is taking place. There’s construction going on adjacent to the school. The principal is very committed to getting kids moving and outdoors, and classes are on an A/B week rotation for recess. Youngest grades do go out in the little yard more often. \n2) There’s ONE FREE AFTERSCHOOL now, rather than a segregated system. The program is run by Good Shepherd, and the PTA funds teachers and enrichments. Those who can, donate to the PTA. All kids benefit. It’s a fantastic step in the right direction, and my white, special needs kid is doing just fine there. \n3) The middle school has been gone for a while now. \n\nMy child has been a student here since  kindergarten. We came in the same year as Principal Watson-Adin. She’s VERY involved with the kids and knows them all by name. She’s dedicated, loving, hard working and has high expectations. She has been trying so hard to turn things around, and there’s some support within the staff, but also resistance. There’s racial tension at the school, because many of the staff don’t want to do the work on their own implicit biases. It can be a stressful work environment because there are kids dealing with the trauma of poverty. Those who are committed are sticking it out, and I’m so grateful to them! We have had almost entirely fantastic teachers, and I really appreciate that the staff is diverse. Wish more men would teach elementary!\nAlso, many parents haven’t dealt with their own racial stress, so they pass it on to their kids. \nThere’s a lot of work to be done to create a truly inclusive culture at PS32, and throughout NYC as a whole. I hope that by the time the expansion is finished, and the school population doubles, we have come together to create an understanding and inclusive family. \n\nThis site’s metrics don’t seem to reflect what’s really going on inside the schools. Plus, I feel like the whole premise upholds hoarding of resources and racism. \n\nI know we as parents want to do the work of finding an appropriate fit, but I hope we won’t stop there. If we lead the conversation about true inclusion, and advocate for ALL children within the school we chose, our whole society can change for our kids. Learning to get along with people who are different from you, look different, learn differently, have different backgrounds, can be so much more valuable to future employers than whether you know algebra. There will be bullying throughout life, in fact we see it everywhere in our country now. What if we help them learn to not be a victim? What if they learn restorative justice? What if they learn conflict resolution? \n\nHere’s a podcast about the concept of a “hidden gem” that really opened my eyes.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-integrated-schools-podcast/id1440625690?mt=2&i=1000424312872\n“There are lots of great schools without many white kids, however, when white parents start to integrate a global majority school because they think they\'ve found a hidden gem, it can lead in some troubling directions.

We touch on the narrative around what makes a ""good"" school, and we discuss how the Hidden Gem story encourages resource hoarding and can pave the way for colonizing.“', 'As a fifth grade student, I would like to disagree with the many unhappy comments. The school is welcoming, the teachers are amazing at their profession, and it has taught me so much. I have thrived both academically and physically and will greatly miss all of the amazing faculty. Ms.Ava, the art teacher is very talented, Mr.Marcus, make learning about books a blast, and Mr.Bogan, the gym teacher, taught me the most about emotional and physical awareness. \n Apart from that, the building is very different from the page, as it has been updated. The portables have been removed, the girls bathrooms have been renovated, the middle school got kicked out, and the science lab has changed.\n In art, older students can use computers to print photos, and use graphic design. In science, there is a variety of projects, and stem has been worked through the curriculum. For gym, be aware that the teacher guides kids to a healthy path, keeping them emotionally and physically stable. In library, it is focused in ""read something, say something"". In dance, there is a combination of modern, African, hip hop, and ballet. The school also partnered with the Met opera, giving field trips there each year for grades 3 and up.\n It is also advanced in tech. there are iPad carts, laptops, smart boards, and more. It also treats disabled kids like everyone else, while still helping them. There is a blind kid in our grade, who still is academically challenged, but still has a specialized teacher to guide him. There is also a room for physical therapy.\n To close my statement, PS32 is an amazing school, and all can thrive there.', 'I agree with your comment, it describes the school perfectly!', 'The NEST program teachers and support team are great- amazing actually- but the amount of bullying and misbehaving going on makes the in class time for the NEST kids much less effective. The kids are supposed to be with neurotypical kids to model social skills and behavior but our experience is the opposite- they get bullied and the ill behavior of these kids impacts the whole class. \nThis coupled with no real recess because of the expansion means there’s barely any running around or being creative. Recess time includes watching a movie (where the kids are reprimanded for speaking to others) or a game room or the gym- where they can just sit if they want to. Each class can do whatever they want so some kids don’t get to see their friends all day.\nThe teachers are allowed to go to the park but because of the misbehaving and behaviorally challenges kids the teachers opt out- leaving even more aggressive kids who don’t get to run around.\nI would have chosen a different school if I’d known- but again, the NEST staff and the social workers are amazing...', 'The G&T program is okay (not great since most of the G&T teachers don\'t really have much G&T teaching experience) and my impression is that the ASD NEST program is great.  However, the notion that there are no general ed classes is highly misleading.  There are plenty of gen ed local kids, and they are typically an ill-behaved and ill-tempered bunch.  Fights at recess occur on a regular basis, for instance, and bullies abound.  In the spirit of ""we are a community,"" often all kids have to miss recess that period or have it cut in half because one or two of these kids misbehave.  The lack of a yard makes things much tougher as well.  All in all, buyer beware.', 'I disagree about the school not being warm with the new administration (which is really just a new principal and some office staff). My children love the principal. She gives them hugs every time she sees them, she makes them smile, and she is there if I have concerns. We have been at the school for 5 years and I have 2 children in the School. The principal is also much more communicative than the previous principal - she offers a once per month sit down with parents to hear their concerns and has an open door policy.

The G&T program generally teaches the same material as other schools, there\'s just more homework and more students in a class. For some reason, the majority of the kids in these classes are girls (I have no idea why but a class of around 25-30 will usually only have 6 boys). Additionally, these classes are filled with white, upper middle class kids from neighborhoods such as carroll gardens and cobble hill. Its basically showing kids, ""look these are the gifted ones"" which not only is kind of unfair for kids who aren\'t in G&T but also kind of racist because of the magnitude of white kids in the G&T class (yes its obvious even to a 5 year old). Additionally, in an attempt to de segregate these classes from general ed, the new principal Ms. Watson decided to have them have recess together. But since there is construction and everyone is having recess in the little yard, there can only be 2 classes at recess at once. That means one G&T class with one general ed class. The other G&T class with the other general ed class. G&T parents were outraged that their kids were being separated all day from the friends that they had made last year and were now in separate G&T classes and weren\'t having recess together. The classes that were now having recess together weren\'t even getting along and it was made apparent that Ms. Watson was punishing kids from G&T more harshly than she would punish kids from general ed for breaking school rules, which aggravated parents further. Basically these G&T kids and parents think that they are better than the general ed ppl at the school, just because of a test that they took in pre K. I went to ps 32 (class of 2015) and was in general ed and I loved that school. I never felt out of places and still look back with a smile on my memories at that school. My brother who was in G&T (class of 2019) ended up having problems at this school like not being able to see his best friend in the other class, not being able to finish all of his homework, being looked down on by staff, etc. He ended up transferring out of this school I. 4th grade to go to PS 29 and had a much better experience there.

I don\'t know that it\'s more enriching because we aren\'t in the D15 gen ed to compare directly, but our daughter\'s teachers have been wonderful and her learning growth has been amazing (not just in terms of what she\'s learned but her passion for learning). \n\nBeyond that, there is the advantage of being grouped with peers at a similar level. The classes are remarkably calm and pleasant, which I think is a combination of good teaching and the sorting effect of the test -- I am skeptical that it picks up ""giftedness"" in 4-year-olds, but I think it picks up patience and focus. \n\nPS 32 does have tons to offer in terms of enrichment programming, more than I saw at any of the D15 schools we toured (and I toured many). \n\nAlso, one unsung advantage of G&T is that kids rarely enter in the upper grades. If you\'re familiar with the union contract, class size caps go up every year. In most schools, that means that they consolidate classes through the grades and by the time kids are in grades 4-5, they may be in a group of 30-32 instead of 23-25 as they were in kindergarten. With G&T, the class size often remains constant after kindergarten or experiences only modest growth. That\'s probably not as true at citywide programs where families do push for every single spot every year. But in the district programs, it\'s much less common for families to pursue entry in later grades, especially in a district like 15, where most of the schools are pretty good -- why move your kid after they\'ve settled in and made friends? This almost always means that class sizes are smaller in the upper grades of a G&T program. My older child went through a district G&T program and her class size actually started at 25, but with kids moving out of the city and seats not getting filled, they were down to 22 by 4th and 5th grade. Our current class at 32 is 22 or 23 kids.']"

This is usually based on test scores which, really, are a reflection of parents\' class and education - and not the job the school, itself, is doing.  To assume that the non-""white and privileged"" children in a building ""barely know english"" and have ""absentee parents"" is both disgusting and dismissive.  Disgusting in the racist and classist assumption regarding the children\'s home life and also in the assumption that an immigrant child or a child without both parents present have no value.   I would argue that any white child with parents who feel this way is less privileged as they are moving through their childhood missing the opportunity to grown and learn from the other residents of our amazing city.  Kids all grow and benefit when they sit next to, grow up with, and learn alongside people unlike themselves.

There is much more of a sense of community and diversity at this school than most schools in the area."", ""OK, here's my update. Pascale, the new principal, is friendly, responsive, and very open to ideas and suggestions -- she actually replies to emails and is available every morning at drop off (the old principal never once responded to any parents' emails and was rarely seen at the school before 8am). Pascale actually shows up at the PTA meetings with updates, and without bringing confrontation (yes, this is actually a new thing for this school). I've seen a lot of changes implemented due to parents' requests, sometimes the very next day. Pascale instituted free early morning drop off from 730-8am (a big help for working families), has gotten a math app called Dreambox for all students (my kids love it), and will be piloting a social-emotional wellness program in May for the upper grades (if it's successful, it'll be rolled out to all the grades). Communication overall has gotten better and better, esp. since the beginning of the school year. There is no longer homework for Kindergartners (fine by me) but there's homework for all of the other grades (also fine, and very manageable). The school has a Community Schools grant (I think we're in the 2nd year of the 5 year grant) and I've noticed this year that all of the K and 2nd Grade classes have free school trips to places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and AMNH -- so far we're on our third free school trip. The PTA's afterschool enrichment is a highlight of the school -- really great quality. And Community Schools also offers free afterschool enrichment on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursday (my kids have participated and the classes are fantastic). Parent participation in the PTA could still be better (probably caused by fewer SAH parents than at schools with wealthier families) and fundraising could be better (again, fewer wealthy families). I sense less tension between G&T and Gen Ed families, maybe because Pascale doesn't stoke the flames, maybe because more families are less afraid of the school (because we have a good principal now) and are willing to enroll in the Gen Ed."", ""I will also add that I don't think there were any other admin changes aside from the new principal. With Pascale in, it seems like everyone could finally exhale, relax, and get work done. The Parent Coordinator, who used to be useless (I know that sounds harsh, but he sent out maybe three email messages on school events per year, he never returned a single email, never had an answer to a question, etc.), is actually very active now and (who knew!) quite competent. This year he responds to emails right away. He's given workshops on the Middle School selection and application process. He sends out school updates on average twice a week. I guess he had to do whatever the previous principal wanted him to do, which was to be her lackey. But, with the new principal in, he's allowed to actually be a functioning, helpful Parent Coordinator. So, lots of positive change in engagement from the top down."", ""Any updates about this school, would love to hear some parent's perspective of new administration and how it is all going."", 'Ever since the previous principal left, my child has been the victim of relentless bullying that is not being effectively dressed by the current administration.

She has gotten rid of homework in Kindergarten but not in the other grades, and she encourages all of the students to read (teachers in K send home book baggies and K students participate in the school-wide Reading Log contest) and to use the Dreambox math application (just started in the school for all grades this month)."", 'Homework has not been banned (I wish it was!). The only grade that does not get homework is kindergarten (though my kindergartener does have reading and math assigned, it just isn’t mandatory I guess).

As mentioned in a previous post a month ago, the Principal Yolanda Ramirez announced on the last day of school over the school intercom (somewhat oddly) that she would be retiring at the end of the 2017 / 2018 school year. Per DOE regulations, she then had 60 days to renege on that decision, which would be on or about 8/25/18. So she technically still has a few days left, and she has announced similar retirement plans in years past, only to go back on her decision mid-summer. But as of this week, the school's website (http://www.pacificschool.org/) now shows Pascale Pradel as the new Principal. Ms. Pradel has most recently been the Assistant Principal at Park Slope's P.S. 107 (http://ps107.org/administration/), a high-functioning, successful school where the administration has received solid reviews from teacher surveys. P.S. 107 does not have nearly the diverse population that P.S. 38 does, but hopefully Ms. Pradel will rise to the challenge of bringing the many communities together and be a successful uniter. The bottom line is, P.S. 38 has a new lease on life and a chance to flourish into the thriving, diverse beacon of D15 that it should be. For all of you BoCoCa and other D15 families who have fled as far away as possible from P.S. 38 because of the toxic administration of years past, now is the time to give it another look.  Ben, the P.S. 38 optimistic parent."", 'On the last day of school Ms. Yolanda announced her retirement date as 8/31/18.

Our school never participates in District 15 Science Fair. Why? I really don't know.  I have no idea what the STEM Lab looks like since I have never seen it and neither have my kids. As for the Olympics, it was cancelled this school year. Why? Again, I don't know. Communication at this school is the worst.\nThe school principal doesn't bother to show up to mandatory SLT meetings and instead sends a different proxy for each missed meeting and continuously fails to submit the school budget. \nYes, Community Schools is bringing in much needed help but when the leader of the school doesn't foster inclusion or works to improve equity, I'm not sure how much progress can get done.\nP.S. 38 has much to offer... to G&T families."", 'P.S. 38 is a type1 school—which means they get offered student loans deductions to teach there—what does that tell us about the quality of its curriculum?', 'I must start this review by stating my kid loves this school. The building itself is bright, the halls are lined with art and school work. There is a large play yard where after school, kids play and parents socialize. The teachers are outstanding, G&T and general education.  Most classrooms hover near 25 (give or take a couple of students) and the teachers seem in control. Throughout the school year, kids look forward to really fun field trips, performing in the winter and spring show and the annual Olympics. \n\nAs for the administration, this is where the school is really lacking. Keeping a school safe in the world today is a daunting task and, in regards to this, I believe Dr. Yolanda is doing a fine job. That being said, Dr. Yolanda is extremely defensive and it’s almost impossible to hold a conversation with her without being shut-down. She espouses an “open-door policy” but that’s not true. She treats any parent with challenging questions as a threat. I can’t shake the feeling we are in HER building. There have been two separate instances where parents were told to leave the building: one time a PTA meeting was kicked out of the school since the executive board failed to submit a permit to meet and another time when the library committee was escorted out of the building since she was unaware of their meeting. \n\nAs for communication, the website is out-dated and almost always missing important upcoming dates for meetings and events. The parent-teacher coordinator sends out a handful of emails regarding school events during the year and the common complaint from most is that he almost never replies to any emails. More often that not, school administration sponsored events go unnoticed because parents simply didn’t know about them.\n\nI ought to add there are two schools here: G&T and gen-ed. I have no idea why but the two groups are rarely encouraged to mix. Each class is told to sit with their own class during lunch, they never share buses during field trips and sometimes they don’t even take the same field trips. As for the teachers, G&T classrooms almost never run out of supplies whereas gen-ed teachers struggle for what little they get. I won’t get into holiday gifts for teachers but inequity is crystal clear. \n\nThe school is far from perfect but if you just want your kid to receive a strong education and little else, this school is a good choice.', 'https://nypost.com/2018/02/07/city-principals-caught-behaving-badly/', '""PS 38 Principal Yolanda Ramirez admitted to bringing her 3-year-old grandson to her school during the 2015-2016\nschool year and had him participate in a Pre-K classes ten times... the pre-K class she illegally placed her grandson in was already at maximum limit of 18, the COIB settlement said.....

It is a great school, going through turbulent times.  Really it\'s a tale of two schools.  One is the school run by the teachers, it is tremendous.  Flourishing students, a G&T program, lively school life, and involved families.  The school has  dedicated TALENTED teachers who create one of the warmest and most encouraging atmospheres I have ever seen.  The learning is real.  The work is great, and the students are benefitting hugely. This is a good school for your child to come to and learn and socialize. \n The other school is the one run by the Admin.  The biggest stain on the school is poor leadership.  The principal cannot be faulted for her kindness, concern and regards for the students.  She can be a real ally on a person to person level, and I have seen her help people.  I do not know the pressures on a NYC school principal, they must be huge.  State, city, and DOE regs to follow, 580 lives to protect, and a rapidly changing community with all the problems that brings.  And yet... she is not failing because of any of those things.  Those are the THE JOB.   Where she is failing is leadership.  She is frequently at odds with parents and staff.  She operates from a defensive position and does not seem interested in explaining her decisions or policies,  constructive criticism on the same, or looking deep into the problems of the school to create structural change. Talking to her is often a frustrating experience as she will, with practiced ease, change the subject, or even turn the conversation towards a parents failings rather than the schools.  Communication is poor, to pathetic.  The principals attitude trickles down to some her staff. If a change is made, even something simple like the elimination of scooter parking in the building, any request for more information is met with a combative attitude. There are monthly ""community conversations"" which were conceived as a forum for parents and admin to interact. In practice they are tense meetings often marred by partisan alliances. There is an openly hostile relationship between the admin and the PTA, and it seems to emanate from her office, and I have seen it poison relationships and efforts within the school.  Some parents love her, and I guess I can see why, but I often feel they have been taken in by her saccharine demeanor and small victories (a room with computers...amazing).  Her biggest skill may be in finding those teachers, she has a good eye for talent.  So much more to say about all of this.

We had a very hard time getting our 504 plan (for an epipen/peanut allergy) implemented- it took 6 weeks to get her teacher trained on an epipen. There were many unreturned phone calls from the nurse and administrators, I had to be at school in person way more than necessary, emails to administrators went to full mailboxes, listed email address for the parent coordinator was incorrect. Long story short, I couldn't get anything done until I wrote to the principal. She was able to set things right almost immediately, and she was very warm and responsive, both in person and over email. I don't understand why this is so, it seems inefficient, but that has been my experience. \n\nThe pros are strong though! My daughter's teacher is wonderful, as are other teachers I've encountered. I say this with some authority because I am also an educator. I've yet to meet a parent who does not love every teacher they've had there, and my colleague (also a teacher) whose child has been there since K swears that every teacher is top-notch. \n\nWhen I visited, I was impressed with what I saw in the classroom I toured (3rd grade): vocabulary was advanced, there was evidence of conceptual math and science work being done, ELA showed evidence of critical thinking, the work was high-level and it was clear the teacher was working really hard as well. \n\nSimilarly, we had an amazing first conference with my daughter's teacher: goals and methods were clear, she was being challenged, her teacher obviously knew her as a learner and was pushing her to progress. We had come from private school, and never had a conference that effective, from an academic/clarity perspective, despite paying tens of thousands of dollars. We are very pleased with the academics and with her progress. \n\nThe only thing about the academics that I don't love is that social studies gets short shrift. SS is a passion of mine, and luckily I feel well-equipped to supplement. As a math teacher, I know that robust math instruction in the elementary grades is hard to find, and on balance I'd rather have the strong math instruction (which we have) than SS, but I feel like SS really is an afterthought. \n\nAlso, there is no visual-arts program, although there are good alternatives for all grade levels through the after-school enrichment offerings. It is now run by the PTA and I've not heard of kids being shut out of it- it is easy to sign up through the PTA web site and there are many good, fun programs. \n\nNo one loves not having all the pieces in place in the schools we have to choose from, but we feel this is a good school for our family and our priorities, now that I know how to get things done at the administrative level. The school is very diverse, and we love that our daughter has the opportunity to make friends with all kinds of children.

Problem solved.\n\nThere are kids who struggle in the typical classroom environment - special needs kids are often terribly bright but need different learning models. They can do an Individualized Education Plan and go to a school or classroom suited to them, or, as a couple parents we know, they end up going to a special private school like the Lang, using funds from the DoE to augment their high cost. Not ideal, but no one said having kids was going to be cheap. My point is, the fretting seems to happen BEFORE that first year. Not so much after (til middle school of course, but that's a different story that usually ends up okay).\n\nLastly, I find the old yarns about NYC Public Schools to be complete malarkey. Brooklyn has great schools, with a few clunkers. Usually those poor schools suffer from poor leadership.

I  would stress to parents worried about public school that your teacher is the absolutely most important part of the equation. As a parent, I was overly concerned about the school\'s reputation. I wish I would have taken the time to talk to the teachers, because then I wouldn\'t feel like I won the lottery. I\'d feel like I\'d put the most important part of my kid\'s education first - the teachers.\n\nYolanda hires fantastic  teachers. And my experience so far as a member of the school leadership team has allowed me to see her in action. She\'s caring and competent in  all regards. She is incredibly easy to access, and answers all emails \nquickly. She meets with parents all the time, and stays super late looking after any children who have been left due to emergencies. She\'s the real deal - maybe a bit old school, but in a good way.\n\nThe PTA co-presidents Chris Brown and Corinthia Carter are totally committed\n and capable. Get their emails! Talk to them. They may be able to \nreassure you on certain fronts. \n\nParents also seem to want a school that they\'re welcome in. I bring my kid to the door most days, and am welcome in the school always. If anything, maybe it\'s TOO lax. While it was hard letting my little girl go in PRE-K (we were at PS705),\n the fact is, after a week I was relieved to leave her at the front door and get on with my morning! And tight security is reassuring once you\'ve left the building. It\'s not that I want them NOT to let us in; maybe at least a sign in.\n\nOkay. Now the downside that I\'d agree with. The school is missing a cylinder in the communications department. I hear parents complain a lot about this, though in fairness, there seems to be a bit of confusion about who\'s supposed to do what. That needs to change. Parents want quick responses to emails, and they\'re not getting them from the parent-teacher coordinator. IMO, that position is under-utilized, maybe even poorly defined. A lot of us choose to go straight to the principal instead - that doesn\'t seem right to me. I look forward to working with the school to improve things, like timely announcements, parent engagement, stuff like that. But that doesn\'t really influence the experience my daughter is having, so I wonder if maybe we\'re grousing too much and not taking enough initiative ourselves. If I had to point to one reason the school has fewer students in the higher grades, it\'s that parents become distant from the school community over time. That must be corrected; I look forward to working with the leadership on this, because I have another coming into pre-K and I\'d like to stay at the school for the duration.\n\nThe Inside Schools review points to a perceived ""roughness"" that I can\'t really say is warranted. From what I\'ve seen the schoolyard is well-supervised, and issues between kids are addressed bringing in parents when necessary. The bathrooms need an update, but the custodial staff is friendly and responsive. I know that sometimes 4th and 5th graders can use course language, especially born and bred New Yorkers. That doesn\'t trouble me though. I see it on other playgrounds as well. It ain\'t Kansas, but it\'s hardly Rikers.\n\nHopefully the new system of class parents will help created a better sense of community to  last through the higher grades. Because there are great teachers in \nevery year - both experience and commitment. Privately teachers say that there\'s been a vast improvement over just a few years. \n\nI\'ll do another comment on G&T, since it\'s a somewhat different conversation. But ALL the teachers are great, and it doesn\'t seem to make much difference whether you\'re in G&T or not in terms of the kids. They\'re kindergarteners. They\'re all brilliant and hilarious.', 'Is your daughter still in G&T at 38? If so I would love to hear how it has been for the past 3 years.', ""all the teachers in p.s. 38 rock!!! But it's said i'm leaving so YA CLASS OF 2014!!!!!!!!!!"", ""As a parent of a student in the current G&T kindergarten class; I am thrilled with the academic achievements, the caring teachers and the welcoming administrative staff. The two G&T classes have only 14 students each this year and I personally believe that the benefits of this were outstanding. The small class size left the classes manageable allowing Ms. Scharf and Ms. Adams to dedicate\ntheir time to answer and foster inquisitive minds and truly made the classes thrive. My daughter, was reading in October. I have never seen either teacher flustered or upset rather they have always been upbeat, welcoming and patient, no easy task for kindergarten teachers. As both a mother and a teacher I know firsthand the benefits of small class size. As a teacher you are better able to interact, rather than crowd control and give busy work. They have covered lovely course work, projects, school performances, wide variety of after school enrichment classes to choice from and fun field trips.\n\nFor any parent considering P.S. 38, there is a palpable and unique energy, which can be seen in the devotion of the teachers, the heart-felt administrative staff including Ms. Yolanda and Ms. De Anna and the PTA.  I am looking forward to 1st Grade. Many thanks\nto all of you who have had a hand in my little one's education and making it such a positive experience for the whole family."", 'I personally know this parent, ""V. Cuccurullo"", and she is spot on about PS 38.  Let\'s just say that my child is zoned to a ""good school"" in Park Slope but because of what I see within the GNT at PS38; the morning and afternoon drives are worth it.  In fact, I know a parent that is pulling her child out of PS107 and into PS38 GNT.  That right there speaks volume about what 38 is doing.\n\nSince Most families in the GNT program do not live in the neighborhood we setup a Google Group in order to stay in touch, setup play dates, and communicate with the teacher.\n\nLooking forward to next year.']"

What I can say is that 51 has taught me how to become more extroverted and while being more social has its own problems (keeping friends, gossiping, etc) it\'s what really gets you through this school with flying colors. I was able to get into great high schools and graduate on a fantastic note; by the end of my experience I knew basically everyone. So if your child may seem like someone who would get lost in the crowd, a word of advice would be to make friends at the beginning. That\'s what really gives you the confidence to participate and not be left unheard.\n\nPS. The teachers recognize diligent and very good students easily. If they realize that a student is ""lost in the crowd"" they make it their mission to draw out the best in the student.

MS51 is the best school for me. If I had gone to another school I wouldn\'t have enjoyed my middle school experience as much as I do in 51. Unfortunately, there are some nasty rumors about 51. Many people think the principle does not take control of the staff and does not organize as many field trips and events as they would like. But that is not true at all. Everyone looks up to Ms. Berner: the 51 principle. She organizes at least one field trip per grade per year. Most of you will think that is not many, but with 1000 kids going somewhere is very hard and expensive. And the field trips we go on are always for more than one night and are always fun and educational. Teachers also can take there class on the field trips, after they get permission from Ms. Berner. For example, my science teacher, Mr. Sandman (who is the best teacher ever) is going to take us to the gowanus to study the creatures that live there. Another example is in 7th grade, the photography kids get to go to Greenwood cemetery to take really awesome and amazing photographs. Another rumor is that there is no technology at the school which is not even close to being true. Last year, my class got to have 7 I-pads that we all could use. Also, we have a computer lab which has computers for the entire class with extras. In the library there are about 30 computers and there are laptops which teachers can ""rent"" to use for there class. Also, kids are allowed to use there phones if you have permission from there teacher and it is for school use only. \n\nSo here are some things about 51, there are 6 talents which you will try out to get in after you get into 51. And you take that talent for 3 years. I know its a lot, but just wait until high school! The talents are: dance, photography, art, drama, vocals, and instrumental. I can really only tell you about photography, but if you have any questions about other talents just comment and I\'ll try my best to answer them. So in 6th grade you work with black and white film cameras. At our school, we have a dark room which you can use during class and after school. In 7th grade we do digital images. We learn who to edit our photos on photo shop. In 8th grade, you get to decide what you want to do. One project you can do film and another you could do digital. Ms. Flatow is by far the best talent teacher, she plays music in class, come up with the best project ideas and makes photography so interesting and awesome. \n\nAll of the teachers at 51 are so nice and they are always there to help if you need it. We have a huge auditorium and gym. Everyone has a chance to be apart of the student council. Every year, the whole school votes on a 7th grader to become vice president. When the vp is in 8th grade, they become the president. This year the president is Sam Levine, who is a friend of mine. The homework is not that much. If you plan your time and get some homework done in lunch, you will have about 30 minutes of homework per night or less. I know it\'s not that much. \n\nWe have a tiny cafeteria, because we get to go out for lunch. You can also go to the library for lunch. the school is situated on 5th avenue, so there are a lot of restaurants that have good prices, because they all know we are middle schoolers. There is dumplings, sushi, vietnamese, pizza, tacos, crepes, fried rice, bagels... \n\nI really hope my comment helped you. MS51 is an awesome school, and I wouldn\'t be as talented or as smart if I didn\'t go there!\n\n-8th grader', ""Though I would like to be more positive about MS 51, besides having good students and a few good teachers, the school has several problems. One is the principal and her assistant principals. The principal is very weak and the staff does not seem to respect her. Unfortunately, she does not take action against teachers that need to be disciplined or at least given some guidance. Even after many complaints about various teachers, nothing was ever done. Some have even remarked that there is nothing the school can do to them since they have tenure. Tenure gives you the opportunity for due process, not a guarantee of a job no matter what you do, which the principal and her assistants either don't understand or refuse to take action. Teaching as well as running a school are really hard jobs, but even small steps, over time, are possible to rid the school of its negative policies and teachers. One grave example of this has been the implementation of PupilPath. After much advocating by parents, it was adopted by the school, but its use is limited. Unfortunately it hasn't succeeded in allowing parents to help their children since most of the teachers don't use it or rarely enter assignments or grades. The principal could make all teachers use it, but she says the teachers' contract prevents her. That is not true. She should read the contract or speak to other principals that have mandated its use. In the end, its about helping the students. Parents can't help their children if they don't know what is going on. Most 12 year olds can't remember all the tests they've taken and trying to read their planners can be a nightmare. Many teachers in other schools post assignments and upcoming on exams on PupilPath so it can be done. Another issue is the yearly trips. They discriminate against those who cannot pay their $200-400 cost. Yes, many of the families that attend MS 51 are well off, but for many of us these trips are a luxury that are difficult to afford. If your child does not go on the trip they are left to do worksheets, often with substitutes because their regular teacher is on the trip. Many students just stay home since they know nothing will be taught those days. As much as the principal says meaningful instruction is occurring, it can't if most of the classes are empty. The trips should be open to all, regardless of ability to pay so everyone can be part of the experience. Why not have the students raise money for the trips if they are such a vital part of the school year? The talent program is very innovative, but you have to pay for it. Though, the school can't make you pay the materials fee, most parents are unaware that it is not required. There is also a charge to see your child's artwork or performances. I was told I could not attend the art show unless I paid $10 at the door. Sure, the students get to take their art or photography home at the end of the semester, but you can't go to the show or the performances if you don't pay. Asking for a donation would be a better option or set aside times for free admittance so everyone feels welcome, not only those with the means to attend. MS 51 is still one of the better schools in district 15, but it won't be for long, if changes are not made. Parents still need to actively work with the administration. This is even more important as it gets harder and harder to get into the better high schools. Even the brightest students at MS 51 this year didn't get their first, second and a few their third choices. That, however, is not all MS 51's fault, it is the system in general."", 'Parent advocates say there is ""sorting and segregating"" of District 15 \nmiddle school students.

I am in my second year at MS 51 (7th grade) and I am beyond glad that I get to be in such a tight learning community and creative arts program. Last year all of my teachers, excluding science (if you know Ms. Yip you'd understand), helped me reach my full learning potential and used engaging systems. My problem with science was purely personality based because other than that we did experiments many times a week and I learned. 6th and 7th grade math gives the opportunity to be in an Excel class (honors) and I can say I am fully prepared to take an SHSAT in the fall. No one is complaining about the ELA system because it doesn't deserve to be complained about, I had the best ELA teacher I had ever had last year (Ms. Isaacs.) It is hard to explain the magic of 6th grade in drama, I was basically obsessed with that class and came home raving every time I had it. In the 6th grade you start out with lots of fun drama games, then move into a process drama which is hard to explain but consists of an on going story that you act out with no scripts. Then you move into the play which is super fun and he is great if you have a small part, because he adds in lines for you! (6th and 7th grade are plays he writes.) 7th grade you get to experience play writing and even enter your play into festivals and win scholarships, $, etc. In your last year in drama you preform Shakespeare then do an Exit project.

My science teacher in 7th grade has helped me get into Advanced Science and his class was one of the highlights of 7th grade, for the fact that I learned so much and now can participate in my family's conversations. As for math, my teacher was also one of the best. (7th grade.) I got into Accelerated Math for 8th grade, when most came in 7th grade. Thanks to his thoughtfully planned lessons, I caught up perfectly with the class and understood what was going on. He is caring and came up to my class and all his other classes asking if anyone wanted recommendation letters, and if someone did, he was more than happy to spend his time helping us out with the perfect letter. \n\nMy math teacher this year is also amazing. We learn new things everyday and he finds a way to explain everything so clearly and when we don't understand homework questions after he gives out the answers, he will explain it for us as well as any other question that caused anyone trouble. Any problems we don't get how to solve, her proposes new ways for us to understand them, which is more than helpful.\n\nMy science teacher in 6th grade made me love science, and made my learning fun, and I was always eager to listen and participate in class.

The subjects were taught in the most dry and boring way. All about memorization and very little actual hands on learning in a way that involves and excites student. (and, I wouldn't worry so much about making a teacher lose their job. No one gets fired for being a boring, unengaging teacher).\n     And, as for zero period, unfortunately due to the new teachers' contract, that very helpful aspect of the school will no longer be. A total shame as my child relied on it to get a little one on one, something needed when class size is 32.\n   Honestly,   the classes are too big for any kind of real discussion, question asking, and certain kinds of projects."", 'My child is also in 7th grade. He entered the school as an engaged eager high-performing student. This year, unfortunately, has been very disappointing in two of the most important subjects: science and math. \n\n\nThis year, my son and his classmates were subjected to a science teacher who is clearly in the final throes of burnout. She routinely tells students to ""google it"" when they ask a question. This response to students\' inquiries is so common it\'s become a running joke among students and many parents. Moreover, the teacher\'s reticent to respond to questions, which foster class discussion, has resulted in classes in which the students have shut down. I recently found myself in a conversation with two of her students who were complaining vehemently that they ""didn\'t learn anything in science this year"" and they feel ""cheated"" and they are mad they are ""behind everyone else."" These are bright kids who WANTED to study science and feel they were short changed. As the kids spoke to me, outside the school one afternoon, other children joined the conversation to complain about this teacher. I was quite shocked by what I heard: According to students, this teacher is considerably behind in the curriculum and has, in effect, disqualified her entire class from participating in the annual science fair by not assigning them a science fair project with enough time to complete the task. (I don\'t know if all of this is true, but there was not one dissenting voice among the half a dozen students speaking, so that must mean something.)  My husband or I often pick up our son at school and have heard many kids complain about teachers over the years, this is the first time either of us have heard kids lamenting that they didn\'t get enough homework or do enough rigorous work in class. \n\n\nThe seventh grade math program is also widely inconsistent. There is one dedicated, organized nurturing teacher who seems committed to seeing her students succeed. And another teacher who routinely loses his students\' graded tests, refuses to return parents\' email or phone messages, and does not make himself reliably available for one-on-one time with students who come to him asking for extra help (even though he is mandated to do so). As Pat noted, many parents have complained to the principal about this teacher (not just the 20 or so who met with her, but dozens of parents who\'ve called the school individually — i know someone who has this information first hand).  While there is a lot of nodding and ""I hear you"" very little has been done to address the parents\' concerns. \n\n\nOn a positive note: the  ELA teachers in seventh grade are consistently strong, motivated and energetic. My son has been given interesting assignments and challenging work. His writing has improved markedly this year. I attribute that to his strong and supportive ELA teacher. \n\n\nI too believe this school is coasting on its reputation. For the first time in his academic career, my son has started saying he ""hates"" school. The frustration he feels over his mediocre math and science teachers is heartbreaking. I know there are limited options for parents looking for an academically challenging middle school. If you chose to send your child to 51, please be prepared to supplement the seventh grade math and science curriculum at home. And brace yourself for complaints from your child and an administration that will not necessarily address your concerns with anything more than smiles and platitudes.  \n\n\nThe talent program, as others have noted, is fantastic. The band teacher, in particular, is amazing (but I may be biased, my husband is a musician).\n\n\nThe students, in general, are bright, engaged and academically motivated.  Socially, there are all the problems you\'d expect at a school of this size, with popular groups and kids struggling to fit in. There is also a little too much tween ""dating"" for my taste, with students ""making out"" on the sidewalk after school. But that, i suppose, is a parenting issue. \n\n\n- Vicky, seventh grade mom', 'Ahh!   We know her!   In addition to ""google it"" we love...""What am I, an answer machine?!""  And what about tests with only 10 lame multiple choice questions on it?\n\n\nI mean really.  So what about the recycling program.  She needs to move on.\n\n\nAnd yes, I did meet with her many times.  To no avail.  And my kid who loved and did well in science in 6th grade, did not so well in 7th.  And it is such an important year.', 'My child is in 7th grade at MS 51. Overall the school is mediocre at best. Agree the kids are the best part of the school... some of the faculty & leadership leaves much to be desired though.\n6th grade was a pretty good experience, with the exception of a ""talent"" teacher that is condescending & intimidating to the kids. 7th grade has been a different ball game, my child unfortunately has a math teacher with a long history of complaints (going back years) Test are either not returned or returned months after they are taken, no test prep or support for kids, complete disregard for adhering to dept. curriculum. So bad this year that a group of 20+ concerned parents ( yes 20 parents!) of his students formed a group to elevate serious issues to the principle .... emails go unanswered, calls not returned...took weeks to get an appt with administration. This has been ongoing for the better part of the year, a little lip service but no change.\nI wish I had better things to say & I hope 8th grade will be different but am doubtful. I wouldn\'t recommend 51 as the best place for a child to succeed. The school is on auto pilot, coasting on it\'s reputation.... word will get out soon enough & maybe there will be a change for the positive.', 'My child is a 7th grader at MS 51.  Overall the school is very welcoming.  The kids are by far the best part of the school.  It\'s a really NICE group.  The administration is helpful; even the front desk is really nice.  You can tell there is a lot of justified pride.  \n\nLast year his teachers were great across the board.  This year is a mixed bag.  \n\nThe ELA teachers have all been young and enthusiastic.  There is a lot of creative writing and free reading.  However the books are not assigned; the children pick them on their own.  Good: They like what they are reading.  Bad: They will not have read the ""classics"" and may be behind their peers at other schools in this regard.  You need to keep up with your child so that they are reading at an appropriate level. Also, not much emphasis on grammar.  But, all in all, pretty good.\n\nThe ""talent"" classes are wonderful.  However, you should know the kids pick one ""talent"" and stick with it.  Good: They really excel at that one thing after 3 years and get into the best performing arts schools.  Bad: They don\'t get to experiment with other arts that may be more of their liking .  Its really hard to switch if they don\'t get their pick or don\'t like their talent.\n\nThe math courses seem to be up to a high standard, even for the kids who are not in advanced math.    \n\nMy biggest complaint is that his science class this year is very weak.  There isn\'t even a science room or textbooks for the kids to bring home.  On top of that, the coursework is not taught in an inspiring way that would get kids to love science.  I know that every school has its weak spots, but 7th grade science is so important!  It\'s such a shame.  I feel like my child is falling behind his peers.\n\nLast year the science teacher was unbelievably good.  My child really got a love of science even if he was struggling in the subject. This year he dreads it.  I hope next year is better!\n\nTo that end there are no after school clubs for math or science.  No robotics.  A chess team, but still...if this school wants to compete with the big middle school players they need to bump this up.\n\nAlso, there has been a push to get teachers to post homework online, so far only a few do.  It is hard to know how your child is doing until a report card comes out, so I found that you really be on top of connecting to teachers during the marking period.  Most are good at getting back to you, but some won\'t respond at all.  My child has done best in those classes that have their own webpages where the instructions and the expectations are clear.\n\nThere is a culture at this school that the children have to be very independent in their own education.  They are expected to ask for help when they need it, not the other way around.  This is not so great for a shy or introverted child like mine.  \n\nSo....if you want a large, safe and happy school for your child this is a good place.  It\'s a great school for the bold, dramatic and organized.  It can be super challenging for the shy and daydreamy types.  Next year for the incoming 6th grade homerooms will compile a list of all the kids and parents contacts.  (A no-brainer considering the children are still responsible for getting assignments even if they are sick.) Arts are great, ELA and math are very good.. but science needs to be brought up to speed at all grade levels.  Teachers could do better by keeping in contact with parents or posting their curriculum online to keep us in the loop.', ""I just have to compliment you: I think this is the single best-written review I've read on this entire site! You went into great detail about all the positives and all the negatives, and about the overall culture of the school, and what type of child would do well there or not do well there. Really well-thought-out review!"", 'Thanks!', 'Does anyone know how many kids go to Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech and the specialized High Schools. How many kids from 6th grade have gotten into Hunter?', 'The school has a list it can give you. They usually hand one out on tours. A lot of kids get into the specialized schools and programs. As for Hunter, the scores are based on 5th grade tests to be invited to take the Hunter test.']"

Even after the babies father my husband said I am their mom there is no such a thing. And many times they verified with the babies father My husband I am your mother. Mind you I went in there because Mr. Young called me relating that my son had a problem with gang members threatening my son for his life. I want to do all the right things for my child by doing a safety transfer for my child because he feared for his life. Even the principal suggested that maybe we should’ve moved elsewhere. I knew environment. And we were trying to take care of that matter so where they try to turn this around me. When in fact I gave birth to my child I love my children. On the six grade to the eighth grade my chart only have three more months there. I’ve been picking him up the principles been calling me for any Problems my childhood. The babies father million times Verified if I am in the MomAnd they still went and made a false allegation which wasn’t true. No one should do that to anyone without knowing the facts without finding out the truth. Mind you from six grade to eighth grade he had three more months left. Suddenly they’re saying I’m not his mom. That he has a order protection against me. Which was not even true. Because the blue car didn’t indicate yes or no someone added my name on there Maybe from the school. That’s not my handwriting nor my husband‘s handwriting and neither did indicate yes or no. Without knowing the true they made a false allegations. I wouldn’t want any parents out there to experience with the school put me through for no reason. Top it off I had paid for my sons graduation which was $200. I have requested in front of the principal and assistant principal for a refund for my child’s money for his graduation because he is no longer going to that school. And they just blew me off. That wasn’t right and what they did to me was wrong I am a mother who loves her children dearly. All these years from sixth grade so now he was about to graduate three more months left. Due to This gang members beating him up when he was in seventh grade and threatening him when he’s in eighth grade and my child was scared for his life. And I was doing all the right things to try to help my child.

To be honest, the school had not been his first choice, and I was unsure of how he would fit in and whether or not 88l would be as academically rigorous as others in the district. However, in his time there, he has excelled in all areas, and is currently thriving in the Regents Math and Science classes. In addition, despite its large size, the school has a smaller feel, due to the fact that it's subdivided into three distinct sections, each run by its own assistant principal. I can only speak to my experience, but I have found the asst principal of the Medical House—Gary Nusser—to be extraordinarily amenable to parent communications and commendably hands-on in his approach with students. Beyond that, Principal Mitchell is similarly available, sympathetic to problems, and dynamic in her approaches to solving them. There are many after school clubs and activities, and the Lego Robotics team my son competed with went to the city finals at the Javits Center last year. The trajectory the school is on is clearly a positive one, and I think the path that 88 is on can serve as a guide to other schools in the area as they seek to improve and become successful, competitive institutions. My other son is currently in 5th grade at PS 154, and while 88 had not really been on my radar three years ago, I now whole-heartedly recommend it as an option for other parents I know. It's not a perfect school—nothing is—but it's an excellent choice in a district that, due to the huge size of the student population, needs as many good options as it can get."", 'Same.

The administration, Deans, teachers & Staff were phenomenal! They helped my child succeed and June 2013 my child graduated and went to the high school of his choice with 2 HS regents out of the way. When he was at 88 he joined many different after school programs, and he participated with the end of year school play & community day. I believe all actions from the administration team, Deans, Teachers and Staff benefitted my child as it taught structure, discipline & respect. Now he is In HS and he portrays the same structure, discipline & respect and I THANK them for that! "", ""I don't usually post comments on sites like this but it really disturbed me reading about what people had to say about 88. I can't disagree more with all the negative comments. As a Park Slope parent, schools are the number 1 priority for me and this school exceeded all my expectations. I have had all 3 of my children attend 88 and they all went on to be well prepared and successful in High School. \n\nI couldn't be more proud of the school for preparing my children. The principal is involved in every major activity the school was having and was always available to speak with me when needed. \n\nAcademically, my children scored high level 3's and 4's on the ELA and math exams for the time they were there. The curriculum was engaging, rigorous, and interdisciplinary. My children always raved about something new they learned in school during their time at 88. \n\nThe teachers at M.S. 88 utilize Engrade and were always in constant communication with me. Several of their teachers always allowed them to stay during lunch or after school to get extra help or to get ahead on their assignments. My youngest daughter was in the School of One Math Program and she raved about using technology everyday to learn math. She loved being grouped differently and being able to track her own progress. I found the teachers in that program to be professional and supportive whenever I had a question.\n\nM.S. 88 offers more free after school activities than any other school in the district. When I speak to my friends who are parents at other schools, they tell me that not only do they pay a high fee for activities, but students are not eligible for some of them even if you pay. \n\nMy children participated in the school play when they put on Park Slope Story and Grease! They loved it and are continuing their passion for the Arts in High School.\n\nM.S. 88 offers great community events for families also. Every year they had a carnival in the spring where families can spend quality time with their children. My kids also loved attending all the themed dances throughout the year. However, their favorite activity was always the overnight senior trip to the catskills."", ""I think MS 88 is an amazing school.  I just moved here  in September and I have 2 children in the school.  One child is in the SISTA House and one is in the SMART House.  I have been extremely happy with everything that I have encountered at the school.  The teachers are very knowledgeable, caring, available and approachable.  They really care about my children and keep me updated on their progress.  I also very happy with the vice principals and deans.  One of my son's lost his coat and the dean and vice principal personally went looking for the coat and they actually found it.  I can't believe how much they cared about my son having no coat to go home and they stopped doing whatever they needed to in order to help my child.  The clubs offered are varied and extensive and open to all children. One son joined the play and the other child is in the guitar club.  They have met nice children in class and after school.  The course work is very challenging and interesting.  The teachers teach the curriculum in a way that makes the children excited to come to class.  The homework is meaningful.and prepares the students for the lessons.  Projects are interesting and meaningful.  I am so happy that my children are in this school and look forward to the next two years working with the principal and the other staff members as my children continue to experience the wonderful opportunities that are offered here."", ""Yes, its a school where students have fun and play around but they're still kids!! An addition, the teachers use the students's amusements in order to make them more engaged in their education and I see nothing wrong with that tactic, since both sides are happy. Its like killing two birds with one stone and I would understand that since, I was senior their just last year!"", 'No, Ms 88 is a good school and not all students play around..', ""This is a blanket comment that is wholly untrue.
