We also have a medium sized library where my love for books came from, the librarian Ms.Marla is super nice and helpful and she can recommend you any book you want. This school leaves you feeling prepared to enter the ""real world"" with inalienable experiences, knowledge, and friendships.

I honestly think this school does nothing to solve whatever problems they have, for one, instead of giving something like ""explorers"" give us health classes, or language courses, give the students programs dealing with something career wise... Not everyone may want to have the same career, so this school should be more involved and take more interest as to what the students may like. The school should also reward the children who do very well in all classes, you cannot expect a child to constantly work.

The children who have good grades should also be able to become more creative and more outstanding as an individual.

In the long run, this can lead to the afflicted child to develop a self-depreciating and pessimistic attitude and fear of going to school in general. Another thing that often goes under the radar is that the Teachers here are HIGHLY biased against children they perceive as troublemakers whether that is true or not. I was a former student here and I came on the receiving end of that policy. To this day in high school I am still dealing with the after-effects of my time here in this school and the lack of proper counseling measures really make me question do they actually even care about children (ages 5-10 NO LESS) who are prone to being mentally disturbed (bullying, exclusion, depression ETC).

20K163,"[""My child is in 6th grade at PS/IS 163. This school is a huge disappointment. My child is learning nothing in Science and Social Studies in 6th grade. The reason why I say this is because the teachers are not teaching. Every class the Social Studies teacher has the students read the textbook by themselves and then answer the questions with their partners while she's busy on her computer. If they can't finish the work they bring home to finish it. Every test is either in class open book test or take home. As for the science teacher,very often he goes to the bathroom twice during one period. My child never needs to study for the tests. The tests are just copying the material from the book and move it over to the test paper. Same thing with the science teacher. Lately (soon after the Statewide Exams are over), the ELA teacher had the students read the booklet and answer the questions with their partners while she's on her computer as usual. Oh, I forgot to mention the ELA teacher teaches ELA and Social Studies while the Math teacher teaches Math and science. There are only two classes in 6th grade not including the special ed and these two teachers teaches both classes. SO, you child is doomed. If you are those parents who don't care much about your child's education. Then this school is ok for you."", 'Is this school good\n']"

The children feel this and know the teachers and administrators care for them too.  The well balanced diversity (the school has 4-5 official languages including Bengali and Arabic) which means that every child feels included and special.  Differences are celebrated and welcome.  Ms. Steinberg is masterful at recruiting only the best teachers and keeping some traditional, yet welcome things like school uniforms and good attendance certificates.  Importantly, the school is small enough (compared to other elementary schools) so that needs of parents are addressed without too much formality. The school has amazing extracurricular programs/features that many schools do not have the funding to have such as a beautiful library with school librarian, a state of the art computer lab with Apple computers, both science AND STEAM classes, music, gym, art and others.  The PTA can use more parent involvement but has come a long way considering that the PTA was only formed a couple years ago.  Many of the families have 2 working parents so engaging them can present challenges and the strong work ethic directly shows in the classroom and school.  You know it's a good school when your child doesn't want to miss a day of school, even with a 90 minute a day commute."", 'Just want to say that Ms Steinberg is an amazing principal.
