Meredith, the pre-k teacher, is understanding, communicative, optimistic, and resourceful, and provides weekly or bi-weekly photo newsletters to update parents as to their children's progress. Any questions or concerns I've had have been immediately and most sensitively handled by both teachers. My children are excited for school each day and they come home with wonderful stories of their day. Parents, too, are extremely involved as some come to class every week to initiate sewing, art, and other fun projects. It's a happy school in a small, communal environment and where every student is seen and recognized as an individual. The school is also growing compassionate citizens. There are many different students with a variety of backgrounds and I've never seen a child teased or bullied. If there was ever an inclination toward that, I'm certain teachers and administration would address it immediately. There are small class sizes with the school committed to hiring an additional assistant teacher in each classroom to ensure individual attention. While it may not have as much funding and PTA cash flow as some schools established for far longer, it's steadily growing annually. What far outweighs this is the feeling of community, closeness, and deep trust from the families that have committed to this school. There is a stark difference between drive-by families who place their children here primarily for pre-k and those who stay for the long run and are committed to the school's diverse, nurturing, and close-knit vision. It's a secret gem that's rapidly not so secret anymore. I feel so lucky that my children have found a home here.

But I must add my comments in light of the comment below regarding 'parents behaving badly'. First of all, this is heresay - coming from someone who is not in the school so does not know any of the people or context at hand. I am not about to explain any of it because it really is not as big a deal as it is outlined to be below (I'm sure every school goes through bumps). On a more positive note, I feel it's important to add that the school responded in the best possible way and there has been great communication since. \nI have a child in that same Pre-K class and we believe this school to be gem in the community.

I have friends who have children in \nboth of their pre-k classes.  They are happy to be in such a warm caring\n environment.

She said there are emails circulating that are of a malicious\n nature with the intent of hurting the teachers.  She the incident as a \nhigh school mean girls scenario. What she said was striking was that no \nconversation was had with the principal.  The parent who began the \npetition is going straight to the principal.  I do not know how they \nintend on having a great relationship with the teachers after they find \nout about the insidious plot.  It is also hard to believe that there \nwill not be a split in the parent body in the class.\n\nThe school \nis really big on inclusion and teaching students to communicate \neffectively.

My child entered into pre-K and though we didn't know what to expect, the school has proven itself to be a wonderful school thus far. The teachers are the number one asset. They are courteous, caring, loving, attentive, creative, and progressive individuals. They answer all parent questions with confidence and patience. Similarly, the principal is very in touch with parents and students due to the small size. She knows all the student and parents by their first names. The support of the administrative staff is incomparable. They are friendly, efficient, and always very present. Beyond this, the student/teacher ratio far surpasses other public schools. There are 2 teachers currently in a class of 19 students. As the school has just begun, the environment feels small and intimate. It will take time for the PTA to gather funding to move envisioned programming forward. It will take time for the playground, library, and other initiatives to take off but the principal is very driven and forward moving so it's all just a matter of time. What's the most important factor is the care and nurturing of each child and that has been truly a very positive experience. All the children, from my view, are beyond happy. The parents, too, are all progressive, artistic, friendly, and highly involved in the PTA. In a few years, I'm convinced it will be a school that most families will be competing to get placement. Mentored by the principal of PS 321, Principal Garraway has strong support from the neighboring number one school, the parents, and community-at-large."", 'Hi, I was wondering if there were any current PS 118 parents out there with children in the school\'s integrated program.

15K124,"['My children do not attend this school but I am considering moving into the zone so I stopped in to see firsthand  (May 2019) what PS 124 is like. What I saw was an engaged group of students, orderly classrooms, teachers who were respected and an overall positive vibe. I met the principal, Ms. Maria Interlandi, and I have never been so impressed with an administrator. She answered so many questions and was beyond generous with her time. She is brimming with pride for this school and with her at the helm I am certain that this little school will soon be a big deal. \n\nIn contrast, I tried to enter PS321 and was told the parent coordinator was out to lunch, which was expected since I arrived at noon. When I asked when she might return and was told “around 2 and we don’t do tours” I felt I had a pretty good sense of the way I’d be treated as a parent at both of these schools, one of which is huge and well-known, the other tiny and up-and-coming. Don’t get me wrong here, I’m sure 321 is an excellent institution but Ms. Interlandi at little ol’ PS 124 won me over instantly with her zeal and accessibility.\n\nI don’t know where my two little learners will end up but I am quite sure they’d thrive and really enjoy attending this school. Even if they end up somewhere else, I’ll be watching PS 124 to see what those kids and teachers can accomplish under this new administration.', 'My daughter is currently attending pre-K at 124. We initially came to this school simply because every other pre-K program we applied to we had terrible luck in the lottery, and PS 124 has space. However, I have come to realize that this was actually incredible luck. It\'s my daughter\'s first year at a ""big kid"" school, and PS 124 is a real neighborhood school - it is much smaller than many NYC elementary schools, and most of the kids live just a few blocks from the school. We have gotten to know our neighborhood in a whole new way, and our kid shrieks with joy when she encounters her school friends as we are out and about on evenings and weekends.\n\nThe teachers and administration are incredibly dedicated and kind. At some of the other schools I toured, no one answered the phone and people often seemed hassled or brusque. PS 124 toasty warm by comparison. You can still hear old school Brooklyn accents in the office, though overall the staff\'s diversity is reflective of the student body. There is a new principal this year, and I was concerned when she came on board with very little notice at the beginning of the year. However, I recognized her name from some of the pre-K materials I had gotten from other schools, and I realized that she was someone with experience and connections that were very substantive in Brooklyn early childhood education. I\'ve gotten active in the PTA and interacted with the administration a fair amount, and I am continually impressed by both the principal and the vice principal. It\'s a good team.\n\nA nice way of phrasing things is to say PS 124 is very diverse, and that\'s true and I love it. My kid hollers ""BUENOS DIAS"" at the crossing guard every day and that\'s the world I want to live in. The fact is PS 124 is a Title 1 school which means a majority of kids qualify for free and reduced price lunch, so the whole school eats breakfast and lunch for free and they don\'t means test for that. The school is under-enrolled, especially in the later grades, and I see that as a problem that needs turning around. That\'s the reality with no sugar added.\n\nAll that said, I see every day that my kid is learning, and she\'s socially and emotionally engaged. PS 124 is a family that nurtures the whole child. The other parents are down to earth and with the microscopic commute and ultra-convenient aftercare*, we maximize our family time and minimize stress as well, which promotes everyone\'s well-being and growth.\n\n*Beansprouts and Giocare pick up at the school, so there are convenient aftercare options. For K and up, the Y runs a free afterschool in the building.', ""Hi- I am considering PS 124 for my child's PRE K in the fall. I'd love to get in touch with other PRE K parents with some questions.

My wife has been doing a family album and we have been looking at her school pictures and my two boys school pictures. What I was wondering was whether anyone still may have their yearbooks (did they have elementary school yearbooks?) or class pictures from the early to mid 1960‘s? According to my recollection, in 1962, I was in Ms. Izzi’s 3rd grade class, 1964 I was in Ms. Degner’s 4th grade class, 1965 I again had Ms. Izzi for 5th grade, and finally had Ms. Ahern in 6th grade. I would appreciate any help and thank you all in advance.', 'This is our first year at 124.  Our daughter is currently enrolled in the general ed kindergarten class.  The big buzz about this school these last few years has been about their dual language program.  There wasn’t much info out there from current parents about the general ed program, so I wasn’t quite sure what to expect.  We are in district 15 and zoned for this school, but I did my homework and toured the other neighborhood schools.  After attending the other open houses (yes, every other school’s open house!), meeting the staff and observing the students, my husband and I found 124 and one other local school to fit what we were looking for as our daughter transitioned to big kid school - smaller class sizes, a school with a sense of community, a diverse study body and teachers and staff who really seemed to know the children.  We were especially concerned about finding a school that would be attentive to our daughter’s food allergies and help foster a safe environment.  6 months into our first year, and we are so happy to be a part of this school community.  Our daughter is thriving and we feel that the education she is receiving at 124 is amazing.  Her teacher (Ms. Bradstreet) is really attuned to her students and knows how to play on his/her strengths while encouraging them to work through the areas that he/she may be struggling with.  She has a great handle on the class as a whole and is responsive to any questions or concerns in a timely manner.  She has been with the school for a number of years and is a star.  However, I’ve also heard great things about the other teachers (from all other grades), many of whom have also been with the school for a number of years.  124 also has dedicated art and music teachers on staff and they are also amazing.  Mr. Conrad, the music teacher, is well loved by the students and engages them with more than just songs – my daughter delights in telling us of the dances, hand gestures, and props he brings during music class.\n\nMy husband and I are native NY’ers and feel that the diversity of the students at 124 cannot be found at other local schools.  We are so glad that our daughter has friends from all backgrounds which are truly representative of NYC.  The respect and recognition our daughter already has for other cultures at 5 years old is admirable.\n\nThe PTA at 124 is tiny but mighty.  They are dedicated to helping 124 reach its full potential and welcome any suggestions and feedback parents have.\n\nMy only gripe with the school (more so in terms of administration and the beginning of the school year) is that it is not always as well organized as I wish, but any concerns or issues I’ve raised have been addressed in a timely and thoughtful manner.  I would love for the school to be more up to date in terms of technology and having forms/info available on their website – I believe this is in the works.\n\nIn short, if you are looking for a solid education with arts and physical education incorporated into the weekly curriculum, smaller class sizes, a diverse community and teachers who know each student by name, than 124 may be a great fit for your family.', 'Hello. Thank you for sharing your experience.  Do you still have a positive outlook on the school after 3 years?  Cold you please give an update?', ""My daughter is in the pre-K, and is enthusiastic about what she is learning.  Her teacher provides weekly updates about areas covered in class.  She also loves her music, yoga, and art classes.  \n\nMy communication with her teacher about areas to work on has also been welcome and straightforward.  The PTA is very active in building the community feeling of the school, and the variety of events is appreciated.  There is a diverse student body and exposure to as well as education about various cultures which is another plus.  Was told at a tour that the less than ideal English scores are due to high penetration of English Language learners which was a good thing to keep in mind since numbers don't always tell a whole story."", 'I love this school.  It has a small town feel with big world diversity.  Unlike other schools in the area, PS 124 is a truly diverse school with folks from all income levels, religions, and ethnicity.  I have two children (K and 5th grade); both have received excellent instruction tailored to their specific needs.  My older daughter achieved high scores on her Common Core tests. I feel that the teachers and admin sincerely care and make every effort to see that each student receives the best instruction possible (i.e. kids at the top remain challenged and struggling students receive the help they need).  Do not be fooled by seemingly lagging test scores - these seem attributable to our small school size and immigrant students that are still mastering the language (thus, our big world diversity).  There are also dedicated licensed teachers for art, science, and music - many other schools subcontract  these out as enrichment classes to outside professionals that do not hold a teaching certificate.  For an elementary school - PS 124 is wonderful choice to help children become well-rounded world citizens.', 'Our son has been at PS 124 since pre-K and is now in the third grade.  He has had a great experience every year.  As others have said, PS 124 offers its students a warm, nuturing environment and an excellent education.  In addition to getting strong academic instruction, the kids are given the opportunity to learn among people from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, something that is essential but all too rare in Park Slope.  I continue to be amazed by and grateful for how deeply committed everyone at the school is to creating and fostering an environment of true respect and tolerance.  PS 124 is truly a gem.', ""Our daughter graduated from PS 124 in 2015, after being a student there since Pre-K. PS 124 is a little school with a huge heart. We relocated to Brooklyn from the West Coast, and came with very high expectations of what an elementary school should look and feel like. Admittedly, we were underwhelmed by the school's facilities, but realized very early on that what happened inside each classroom defines a school. This, for us, made up for the lack of bells and whistles on the outside. Our daughter received an incredible education from day one. She was well-prepared for the Common Core tests, and scored 3's and 4's all three years. She left 5th Grade as enthusiastic about school as she did entering into Pre-K, all of which made for a smooth transition into middle school. Outside the classroom, the school's PTA is growing by leaps and bounds, and puts on a series of events throughout the year with the focus of bringing families together and celebrating the school's multi-cultural diversity. Teacher retention is high, with most of the PS 124 teachers holding a 10+ year tenure within the building.

We're very happy with the school, especially with the sense of community. We appreciate the movie nights, robust after school programs, and the caring teachers. In kindergarten, our daughter was sent home with borrowing bags with games as well as leveled reading books that she enjoyed. Parent conferences were detailed and informative - feel appreciative to be a part of a caring community."", 'My son qualified for G and T and we chose to send him to PS130 this year. I really liked the progressive framework of PS130. I went to Bank Street for my own masters in education, and while there are limitations for schools in NYC as to how child-centered and social-studies-as-the-core-of-the-curriculum they can be given the Common Core, I was impressed with the clear efforts PS130 makes to make school and learning meaningful to children. \n\nExamples: there\'s a block room! Classes get to use it for weeks at a time to learn to build together (kindergarten), build a community (first grade), build a subway system/station (second grade) \n\nParents are invited in for Family Friday\'s to participate in the life of the class and the school, and also in meaningful ways in the children\'s curriculum. For example, in the fall kindergartners study Bread, and all families are invited to come in and bake with children or share bread that\'s meaningful to their family. Our class made our own bread recipe book that reflected the beautiful diversity of PS130 families.\n\nThe Common Core sets very high standards for children - high enough that as an educator I don\'t feel that it\'s always developmentally appropriate for many kindergartners. That said, I don\'t at all worry about my G& T- qualified kiddo being challenged enough when the expectation for all students is to be reading short picture books independently by the end of kindergarten and doing story problems, etc. - and I\'ve found that the classrooms at PS130 are warm, loving, not-super-strict and conducive to learning so that if those are the expectations children who are ready to meet them truly will.\n\nOther things we like about kindergarten at PS130:\nThe Lower School is only pre-K through 2nd grade so it has a very early childhood feel to the whole building\nThere\'s enough space (for now!) for a math games room full of math manipulatives, a music room where children learn to read notes and play music, an art room, etc. - whereas many of the local schools are very overcrowded at the moment\nit has a warm, accepting, celebratory feeling to welcome all students of all abilities and backgrounds\nthe whole school follows the responsive classroom model and peaceful conflict resolution skills as children grow \nthe building for 3rd-5th graders is brand new with a huge gym, new playground, art studios, etc.\nthe kindergarten classrooms have table top toys in the morning and center time each afternoon with opportunities to learn through play which I firmly believe as an educator is so so so important - here\'s a piece about it . I love that the PTA provides materials for Art Boxes in all the classrooms so that children have rotating materials to explore. My son comes home with things he created made with wax, oil pastels, pipe cleaners, etc. \nThe parent community is very creative, diverse, musical, and involved - plenty of ways to be so yourself with no pressure!\nI love that PS130 switched to TERC for the math curriculum last year. It\'s a great math curriculum. They\'re still mixing in lots of other strategies from other best math curricula. It\'s great that the curriculum already has ideas for tiered instruction (meaning challenging children who need it on a hire level, supporting children who need help) within lessons, and I know that\'s a big emphasis for their professional development. I feel my son is being challenged enough in math without being in a G and T program -- plus I\'d rather he explore and construct his own knowledge about math (the most challenging part of it!) than be in a program introducing higher-level concepts. I also love that he has Math as a special with a math specialist who brings in Math in the City (I might be getting that name wrong) stories and extended opportunities to work on problems like if there are eight kids on two bunk beds and five hide on the bottom bunk, how many are on the top bunk? Etc. It\'s pre-algebraic thinking!\nMy husband attended the G & T program at PS230 as a child. While a lot has changed in a generation, we decided that we didn\'t want our child\'s identity to center around being ""smarter"" or ""better"" than other children-- all children have strengths and areas where they need support, and the G and T test of spatial thinking and following complex verbal directions are a really narrow measure of who kids are as people! And as we all know, test scores are largely a measure of middle-and-upper-classness. PS130 might have a tad lower test scores than other District 15 schools given the diversity of the school, and that doesn\'t mean that the teaching practices and learning going on aren\'t as good as other District 15 schools! For now, the school also still qualifies for Title I funding, so there is a lot of extra funding available and slightly less pressure on parents to fundraise to provide the enrichments (recess games leaders, etc.) than schools that don\'t receive those kinds of extra funds. As Brooklyn gentrifies this may change (this year\'s spring fundraiser raised the most ever, for example), but for now I view it as a big plus! \n\nFor us it\'s perfect to have our child in a warm, loving school with opportunities for creative expression and a great community, and it seems to us that G and T in this school district isn\'t needed the way it once was. Of course, all children and all families are different! You should tour and see what you think. The pictures in this article are pretty outdated - and I\'d start with a picture of happy kids instead of the expressway as the cover photo ;). Going and feeling what the atmosphere feels like is the best most important way to find a good fit for your own family and child. I\'m really happy to have my child in a school that celebrates everybody!\n\nFinally, any of these presenters are great people to read if you want to learn more about kindergarten and how it has changed/ the value of different components: https://www.bankstreet.edu/events/details/690/\n\nAll the best,\nLena, happy PS130 parent of a kindergartner, with a little one who\'s excited to join for Pre-K', 'Hi Lena,\n\nI agree, every single thing you mentioned that your child and you have experienced at PS 130 is my ideal of a school.  The only issue I have had is that while I\'ve heard a great deal about how wonderful all these things are, on the ground, this hasn\'t been my child\'s experience at all.  It\'s been an incredibly hollow representation of your aforementioned attributes, and it has been a sad and depressing year, punctuated by my child desperately not wanting to go to school out fear of boredom.  \n\nYour child\'s experience sounds phenomenal, and if that was my child\'s experience, I would be a staunch supporter as well.  It\'s just my child has had a markedly different experience-- which I guess is my point with lack of consistency.  \n\nI too am an educator, and subscribe to the Reggio-Emilia/inquiry based/child-led school of thought, however, I\'ve found the experience my child has had at 130 to be so incredibly hollow that I long for a structured traditional curriculum--simply because the ""inquiry"" approach my child has had is so slow, sad and uninteresting that I\'d just love for my child to be getting some exciting information from somewhere.  \n\nI guess it comes down to family and kid and classroom year by year.  It\'s that lack of consistency with this school that seems to be a real issue.  I\'d say you are lucky that your child has had a great year, and I wish you the best and hope that that luck continues throughout the years to come.  However, just as your experience is valid, other\'s experiences are too.  And my voice is just one of many many people who are fleeing this school out of real disappointment and frustrated dissatisfaction.  The inconsistency is paramount and after you\'ve experienced how bad it can be here, as a parent you are reluctant to roll the die with the school again.', '""I guess it comes down to family and kid and classroom year by year. ""  This has been my experience here too. If your family is willing (and have time) to pester the admin/teachers for EVERY LAST THING, your child might get SOME of what they need. Then again, you may go through 6 years at this school and have had some good years, and many bad years.  \nThere are some amazing teachers at this school, some truly excellent.\nThe admin has some strange policies or non-policies. Why they allow ""Secret/ invite only"" clubs to exist makes no sense. Families should know what extracurricular opportunities exist and it should not be at the whim of the teacher running the ""club"" to secretly invite kids. The afterschool situation is not great either.', 'I\'d have to say that this school is really hit or miss. There are some who have a terrific experience here, many others whose experience is spotty, and some whose experience is outright bad. It\'s unfortunate, because there is so much potential, but there seems to be no consistency from class to class, and very little oversight. The administration and principal seem to be much more focused on touting an orthodox interpretation of liberal dogma rather than creating a place where kids are encouraged to think for themselves (FYI I\'m a proto-typical, very liberal, kale-eating Brooklyn parent). It can feel rigid and authoritarian at times, which is odd given the ""progressive"" lip service and newsreels.\n\nThe school is incredibly diverse and has a great parent community, both of which are truly wonderful things. However, there doesn\'t seem to be enough in place, structurally in the admin or in classroom support, or in the curriculum, to actually effectively reach the diverse student body. Instead of acknowledging this diversity and that creating a great school addressing that the wide and divergent student needs is a task greater than average (albeit incredibly worthwhile), the admin seems to just deny that the needs of this incredibly diverse student body, are, well, diverse.\n\nThe school doesn\'t strive for excellence, it strives to get everyone to average. And that\'s really a shame.', 'A former principal at P.S. 234 and current education consultant, Anna Switzer, observed and helped teachers guide students at P.S. 130 in a social studies lesson about Dutch New York, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/nyregion/preaching-the-value-of-social-studies-in-a-second-career.html?_r=0""> The New York Times reports</a>.', 'I have a 3rd, a 5th grader at the school and one graduated 2 years ago.

My experience with the many teachers we have had has been a positive one.  Since we started attending the school, i have seen many good changes. The Arts, music, technology and the PTA.  There are many programs going, giving the kids many choices and keeping their creative minds busy! My daughters enjoy all these activities.  There is Chess club, Band, Guitar, young talent, girls on the run (i enjoy this one very much) and others i am sure i am forgetting. \nWhen the time comes to prepare for testing, teachers do work hard but do not stress the kids.

We have 2 guidance counselors, one in each school and since the upper school is only about a year old. they hired a new guidance counselor and she is amazing.

Also, this review was written when I was in first grade, (I'm now finishing fifth) and our special education team has grown tremendously since then. The special education team is huge! The music program is AMAZING! We have two music teachers and both of them are great. They both actually teach you music! The art program: No comment. We just got an art teacher this year, so I can't really make comment on that. However, the art teacher is very committed and has taught me a lot. The guidance counselors are both very good!

With the exception of fifth grade, which was a nightmare, he had a good experience at BNS. However, he has now started middle school in a private school. We discovered as soon as school started that he was significantly behind in math - not just a little - months behind. The ""grade"" he had received in 4th grade math that was on his record for middle school was a ""4"" which is supposed to mean high performance, so I am left wondering how the school assesses both student performance and the teachers\' abilities to impart math skills and reasoning. I have had to hire tutors right away. Sixth grade math requires strong basic skills to build on as children begin to navigate negative numbers, ratios, decimal to fraction conversions and algebra. My BNS graduate is floundering, though I was never told that he had difficulties in math when he was at the school.

But the school prides itself on being inclusive and having great ways of teaching kids with all kinds of learning challenges. That, I would say, based on my experience and that of many other families, is highly disputable. The deeper problem is political - to admit that many kids don\'t do well, or don\'t do well enough, implies that IEP standards are either bogus or not really being met. The DoE doesn\'t want a zillion lawsuits from special ed students - so very often, kids needs are not met and little or nothing is done about that so as not to create grounds for challenging the capacity of the school to teach ""everyone."" You don\'t have to believe me.

I have met with his teacher a couple of times, and I don\'t feel like she is very fond of my son. I would like to see more ""practice"" work being sent home since the teacher is telling me that he is ""having difficulty"" with certain skills.

15K230,"['Did you like your zoned school and chose G&T despite that? why?\nOur\n zoned school is PS230, so we were fortunate not to have to deal with \ntransport. We also received an acceptance to PS130 which has no G&T \nprogram but we chose PS230 for G&T. I\'m fairly ambivalent about \nG&T programs now that I understand more about why they exist and how\n they can create tensions among kids, parents and admin.\n\n\n\nHow hard is it to get your child to a school outside of your neighborhood and is it \'worth it\'? \n\nCan\'t\n comment on the difficulty since we are close to the school BUT I will \nsay that when we were applying to kindergarten programs, I \nunderestimated how important proximity would be. I was really hoping for\n a citywide G&T program, but now that my kid\'s school is nearby, I \nvalue the peace of mind and total lack of hassle so much more than I \nthought I would.  \n\n\n\nDo you feel like you have a community in the school even if you are traveling out of your neighborhood?\nOther\n kids travel from outside the neighborhood to the G&T program and to\n the Spanish dual-language program. The community aspect is actually one\n of the strongest benefits of the school. There are tons of events for \nparents and kids. The parent coordinator is fantastic, very involved.\n\n\n\nWhat\n is the racial diversity like in your G&T program? Do you see a \ndisparity between your G&T class and the general ed in your school? \nIs there any attempt by the administration to address the issue with the\n whole community?\nThe school serves kids from a very wide \nrange of racial and ethnic backgrounds. There are something like 38 \ndifferent languages spoken by families at the school. In kindergarten the disparity between the single G&T \nclass and the rest of the school was painfully stark. Whites are a \nminority in the school, and it felt like they were all in the one class.\n It has hugely improved over the 5 years we\'ve been there as the class \nhas expanded and some kids have moved out. It\'s still the whitest class \nin the grade, but it\'s much better integrated than before. \n\n\n\nHow much homework does your child have and what grade are they? Is the homework mandatory or is it flexible?\nHomework\n is mandatory for all classes in all grades. In my opinion there\'s too \nmuch of it, and not much flexibility. Sometimes it\'s creatively thought \nout, but at other times I feel it\'s used as a differentiator (i.e., \n""this is how we make G&T seem different from gen ed""). We\'ve tried \nto manage it for our family as best we can, and teachers and admin have \nbeen generally open to discussions.\n\n\n\nIs the classroom curiosity driven or is it more teacher led?\nTeacher-led.\n This school takes a traditional approach. There is not a lot of room \nfor self-directed learning. One reason is the sheer size of the classes -\n since there\'s only one G&T class, it is always at the maximum \nenrollment. That means 25 kids in K, 28 kids in 1st/2nd grades, \nand 30 after that. Having that many kids in a class with only one \nteacher means the environment is really not amenable to individual- or \nstudent-centered learning.\n\n\nDoes\n your district G&T have one G&T classroom on a grade or two? Is \nit good, or a problem, that the kids are in the same class year after \nyear?\nThe thing about having all the kids in the same \nclass year after year is this: if the kids get along, it\'s fantastic, \nlike a tiny school. If they don\'t, or if there are kids with challenges,\n or difficult issues, there is nothing you can do about it. \n\n\n\nDo the G&T kids have friends in the gen ed?\nYes,\n to a limited extent, because different classes have gym together, or \nbecause neighborhood friends are in different classes. \n\n\n\nWhat enrichments does your school have and how often do your kids get them?\nThe\n school has an exceptional and devoted music teacher. There have been \nmajor issues with visual arts. Last year an art teacher retired and \nthere was no plan in place to replace her. Parents petitioned and got a \nplaceholder situation. It remains to be seen how that will pan out down \nthe road. Moreover, there have been years when kids get music OR art but\n not both, much to parents\' dismay. Brooklyn Children\'s \nTheatre runs a great drama program with different grades during the \nschool day. There is no language learning (except in the Spanish \ndual-language program, which has one class per grade).\n\n\n\nWhat is the afterschool like?\nThere\n are very limited after school options at PS230 compared to wealthier \nDistrict 15 schools. There is the franchise Right at School, which we \nhaven\'t experienced but is mostly about homework help. There\'s a chess \nprogram. There are mini-programs run mainly by teachers, such as track \n& field, or soccer, but they do not run for the entire year so they \naren\'t good options for working parents. Here part of the issue is that \nthe programs are designed to be financially accessible to all families, \nand given the socio-economic status of many families in the \nneighborhood, the PTA is not very well resourced and there aren\'t funds \nfor fancier after school options.\n\n\n\nIs there a consistent approach from year to year in G&T or have the teachers been less consistent?\nTeachers\n who have been at PS230 for a while have developed strong programs and \ncreative curriculum ideas to engage G&T kids. The newer G&T \nteachers (of which there\'ve been a fair few) have sometimes struggled to\n manage the kids. Obviously that has a lot to do with kids\' behavior \ntoo, but there have definitely been years when it felt like creative \nlearning was sacrificed.', 'I took early retirement from PS 230 in the fall of 2016, after being harassed by this school\'s administrators. Interestingly, Inside Schools loved their visit to my classroom and used a photo of my students singing ""I\'m a Little Teapot"" there in the resulting profile. In my experience, the PS 230 Admin wants lock-step adherence to phonics instruction from 2 conflicting programs (Teachers College and Wilson) vs little concern for creative expression, social skills development and mental health work for refugee children who have escaped war zones. After being told that in my Kindergarten class I ""sang too much and danced too much"" and where were my 3 phonics periods in the ""flow of the day"", I took the hint and left it all behind, happily. Here is a true story of the nature of the Early Childhood focus at PS 230: expensive wooden blocks are bagged up and put out on the street to be picked up with the garbage.', 'We are generally happy at PS230. The G&T program is fine - mainly an accelerated version of the regular program, but with strong emphasis on writing which we appreciate. The diversity at the school is amazing and the PTA and parent coordinator make heroic efforts to establish a sense of belonging for all students and their families. The principal is the biggest challenge. She is unfriendly, does not respond to emails from parents and is uninterested in interacting with parents in general. She has ignored several efforts to introduce new after-school programs or curricular initiatives. We try to connect with teachers instead. But I agree with Brooklyn Mom below - the good outweighs the bad.', 'My child has been in the G&T program from Kindergarten in 2012 and will graduate the 5th grade in 2018. He had a good experience. The 4th grade year was particularly strong with a very experienced teacher conducting project-based learning. Math comes quite easily to my child, but writing less so. There was a significant amount of effort placed on learning the mechanics of writing in 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade and my child truly benefited. \n\nThere is homework, but it’s appropriate amount. One of the best things about 4th grade and the long-term projects was to teach children the basics of time-management and how to do a little bit each day. It’s an important work-skill and I was psyched to see it employed in the 4th grade.\n\nThe diversity in this school is truly unique. And one of the things I have valued about the school. \n\nThe Brooklyn Children’s theater and the school’s music and band programs have been wonderful. BCT is a first-rate children’s theater program. And the children take real ownership over the plays. Highly recommend. \n\nCons: Science education seems to be severely lacking. School policy of having the children sit and watch movies during cold and inclement weather is pretty terrible (and probably my largest complaint). The new principle seems a bit weak and uncertain. There was quite a bit of drama with a tolerance-based play put on by BCT. The principal did little to diffuse or take control of the situation.\n\nBut the good outweighed the bad - by a long shot. We have really valued the experience my child has had a PS 230. It’s not a perfect school, but I don’t believe there is such a thing. It was right for us, and it may be right for your family.', ""I'm looking into the G&T program at this school.

I've also been very impressed with the students. The older kids generously accept the younger kids into their play, and really look out for them (on the playard after school). I think the school deserves at least some of the credit for the friendly, accepting students, since they emphasize social- emotional development along with academics.

Often I feel like kids are pushed ""academically"" too quickly at the cost of developing other more age appropriate skills like curiosity, playing, exploring and fully understanding themselves as social creatures. A lot of research has recently been done shedding light on the fact that pushing kids too early in academics can be damaging in that it can lead to resentment and frustration with school--so its better to let the kids develop these skills through exploration in their own time I think. This is what I see happening at 261 as least at the K level, I mean they are only babies still in many ways. Having said that there are some kids in his class writing full sentences etc and I think they are equally challenged and supported as the kids still growing these skills. Conceptually, the bar is high at 261 especially in Social Studies and math--for me this is very important and seeing my child enjoy his new found ""super powers"" and growing new interests is more rewarding then knowing he can memorize 50 ""at"" words in a week, which is the type of stuff he was doing at his ""academically rigorous"" pre-K.', '', ""As you can see, there's more to a school than its stats.

There was crappy gross lunch food that nobody liked. There was no beautiful playground! There were chairs here and there and some trees at the back COVERED in cigarettes.

15K295,"[""P.S. 295 is everything we hoped it would be and more. A warm, responsive, creative, caring community of teachers, parents, and staff who put their whole hearts into supporting the growth of every student. We love that the school deeply values the arts—teaching them with passion and rigor. We love that the school is small for the area. We love that the community includes a diversity of experiences and perspectives. Their approach to instruction is differentiated and includes targeted learning supports. During our time at the school we've witnessed our own children overcome several academic hurdles thanks to the attentive and thoughtful intervention of the teachers and administration. I feel thankful for P.S. 295 every day."", 'Our child had many wonderful years at PS 295, and has fond memories of those years. Unfortunately, with the exception of the last year in 5th grade. The 5th grade experience, in our opinion, did not foster or implement the ideals of the community we grew to love for many years. We found that the problem was a combination of large class sizes, and the style of teaching. The teachers seemed unwilling to accept challenges of having close to 35 students and completely gave up on the students mid year. They did not implement effective management techniques and were unwilling to work with parents through their concerns. They were defensive in nature and lacked confidence to find a solution. Each day students came home frazzled from all the chaos. However, the administration were actively working with parents to address their concerns but after a while there was nothing to be said and done due to the teachers unwillingness to work in effective management techniques. Having been a member of this community for years and having gotten to know the children in the grade, it was unacceptable to place the blame onto children who have flourished and thrived in other classroom environments with different styles of leadership. We made the mistake of speaking with other parents about our concerns way too late in the year, when there was little time left to take action, but we learned that so many families dealt with the same frustrations. I write this for future 5th grade families who also face these challenges. Join together and speak up the minute your child comes home and tells you stories that make you go “hmmm..” Join together with your concerns because with everyone individually voicing their experiences, then it is much easier for the concerns to get swept under the carpet. \nSome of our specific concerns were: teachers telling children “they werent ready for middle school” which triggered anxiety, teachers telling children they were not going to succeed at life, eliminating all parties and forms of entertainment creating an imbalance in the community, inconsistencies in homework and classwork (going weeks without anything to piling it on where children spent their entire night binge working), having a bottle on their desk with the phrase “tears of our students”, lack of creative instruction and a dry curriculum, not focusing on writing grammar, spelling and syntax, failing to differentiate instruction and understand individual needs and how to create a community. The teachers took a dictatorship approach which we found riled the children up rather than diffusing their behaviors. \nWe met with the teachers many times, and then the administration many times and were told just to get through the year. It was a very sad way to end our time in a place that we loved so much.', 'Yes, we all know which teacher this post is referring to. I have had multiple children in the school, and put in a request for my youngest child not to have this teacher. Administration granted my request. Definitely a bully!', ""We have 2 kids at 295 now and we absolutely love it - I feel like we won the lottery being there. \n\nIt's a small, tightly-knit community; we feel like we know almost everyone there and have formed deep friendships (both for the kids and parents!). Principal Mazza & VP Pagano are very approachable and warm and really know the kids. The teachers are easy to reach with in-person weekly meetings, or email. All of the staff engage with all the kids, whether they have them in class or not. We have a wonderful Parent Coordinator, Mr. Borrero, who is always helpful in sorting out any questions or concerns that come up - and the kids LOVE playing soccer with him!\n\nSome of the things we love about 295 are: the diversity of the community, the emphasis on the arts, the focus on each child by their teachers, the idea of keeping school fun & approachable, the high level of commitment from everyone, and the ease of getting involved as a parent - however you're able. We find the academics to be challenging without being overwhelming; each child is engaged at their specific level. The support for special needs learners is great: the paraprofessionals, therapists and guidance counselor work as a team to help the kids, both academically and emotionally. \n\nThe PTA is highly active and does amazing things for the school, with the parents working closely together with the staff. There are tons of events where you meet new people & kids make friends (Touch-a-Truck, monthly cupcake sales, Family Fun Fridays, Boogie Brunch, Spring Arts, Dance shares, etc.) There is an online group which is very supportive; information shared and advice to those who seek it. Parents are invited into the classrooms regularly: Parent-Teacher conferences two times a year, Bagel Bits every month (breakfast at the school & then they invite us into the classroom for a period to watch), monthly PTA meetings, countless committees to help out, weekly school bulletins, etc. And parents can arrange to come into the class to read a book or talk about a holiday, job or something else the kids are interested in. \n\nCongregation Beth Elohim runs the afterschool program and their teachers and on-site staff at 295 are very fun & friendly. \n\nThe Cons are: small outdoor space and sometimes not enough free play time. However, they are always working with the parents to brainstorm new ideas and try to come up with creative solutions to these and other concerns."", 'As many posters have commented below, the community of parents at this school is super--many parents are involved, there are lots of school events and ""Bagel Bits"", which gives parents a chance to see their children in their class during school.

When we toured the school, the administration was very clear that it didn\'t focus on test scores and took kids across the spectrum.  I really liked that because I believe our kids have to learn to live in the world - not just in the world of students who score 4s. My child was a high performer.  Unfortunately, the school year started with the teachers focusing on prepping for the state tests in April.  At Back to School night, every single academic teacher said, ""this is how we will prep them for the tests."" There was no development of critical thinking skills in the curriculum.  Daily scores for homework, quizzes and tests were logged.  Bigger projects were not designed for collaborative or critical thinking.  In fact, the project work seemed as rote as the daily grind. Even months into the school year, the teachers didn\'t know who my child was.  Once concerned with social development, I reached out to the guidance counselor and did not receive a return call.  My child wasn\'t engaged or happy about going to school any more.  That is all the negative.  On the positive front, the school community is tight.  The PA has worked extremely hard to improve the school with technology and other additions.  I do believe the Principal works his tail off to improve the school - and he does it with a wide spectrum of learners versus the other neighborhood schools (which only take the top performers).  I believe the school will be great someday but is in transition to that greatness.  To get there, the parents will need to demand a more engaging curriculum, one in which the entire school day isn\'t focused on getting ready for the state tests. To get there, the parents will need to be more involved than they currently are (save the tireless group that gives so much!).  To get there, the school might need to think about how to educate the broad spectrum so that the high performers are challenged while the low performers are rising - perhaps advanced classes should be in the mix.  The arts program is fantastic - all around.  Dance, graphic arts, art, theater and music -- the teachers are extremely talented and also capable teachers. At the end of the day, I didn\'t want my child to get lost in that transition and so we left the school.', ""Our son has had such a different experience at New Voices and is now in 8th grade.  If I've learned anything from having four kids it's that every child is unique!  He's been in the vocal program and I give a lot of credit to the teachers for juggling all they do and still taking great time and care to answer our emails, help our son with organization and be quality class room teachers.  In District 15 there is such extreme segregation in the schools and we were not at all interested in MS51 and MS447 for this reason.  At the time we toured 3 years ago, New Voices was our first choice and it was also much more diverse than it is now.  That said, our son has been very happy there and we would choose NV all over again. We love the small size of the school, the friendly students and caring staff - he also has made some great friends.  At the time he started, only two other students he knew from his elementary school were there and now he has a great circle of friends.   There has never been a day in 2 and a half years our son has not been happy and wanted to go to school and that says a lot considering some subjects can be a challenge for him."", 'Hi.\nwhat school did you transfer to?', 'We switched to a private school.', 'I see, because the public schools have to stick to the curriculum.', 'We were in public school prior to New Voices, and the school did not focus on testing and managed to make the curriculum engaging.  It also focused on critical thinking skills. And good teaching resulted in kids who performed well on assessments even though they were not the focus.  While I appreciate your comment, it is clear that you are working for the school because otherwise you would find some value in both the positive and negative points that I made.  If you were a parent, you wouldn\'t say ""the public schools have to stick to the curriculum."" If you were a parent, you would want the school - regardless of public or private - to create a life-long love of learning in your child.  You wouldn\'t be so resigned to a school that ""has to follow the curriculum"" even if that meant your child was bored, disengaged and not challenged.  You would want the school to improve.  And hearing and acting on honest feedback, albeit from JUST ONE PARENT, is part of improving.  This site is designed to give parents information.  This is one piece of information that I am providing.  There are many other comments that have a different perspective.', 'I am sorry my comment upset you, that was my not my intent. I assure you i do not work for any school or education service of any kind.\nMy first 2 children went to private schools starting in 5th grade. We are considering new voices and other schools for my 3rd. We are not ""resigned to it"".  ""teaching to the test"" seems to be a recurring theme and i have been told by teachers that it becomes more obvious in the upper grades and although they don\'t like it they have to stick to the curriculum.  That is where the comment came from.\n\nIn short, not a teacher, am a parent, care about kids education,  and still not sure where she\'ll end up.\nI hope your child is doing well in the school you chose.', ""Thank you for clarifying, and apologies that I jumped the gun.  Good luck with your decision.  My experience was that the emphasis on the test at New Voices was mostly to do with getting good scores so that people will consider the school as a choice.  I took my child out before the 7th grade, but from what I hear from other parents, the school emphasizes the 7th grade test and scores because of high school placement.  This constant anxiety about the testing to get into middle school and then to get into high school is negative.  That's why I chose private in the end - we'll be able to stay there through high school so no anxiety around the 7th grade performance being the MOST important thing in life."", ""If you don't mind me asking how did your child perform on the tests in relation to years past?"", 'My child scored 3s and 4s in prior years.', 'I meant were the scores from the school year your child attended this school an improvement or loss from years prior', 'A private school.', 'I am currently a 7th grader at New Voices middle school and I have to stay that my school experience so far has been satisfactory , although I mostly only have last year to reflect on considering 7th grade just started .

Academic wise the school work and homework was challenging and in my opinion has prepared me for this year and grades beyond this one . All the teachers I have had so far have been amazing and shown me so many things , everyone for the majority is really nice , and I hope it continues to be the experience it has been so far for the rest of my time there .

During your first year of New Voices, you get to experience what it is like to be each arts class, then in 7th and 8th grade you finally are being taken seriously with one selected major. I'd say the most prominent majors that are well recognized and least neglected are dance and chorus majors. The area is great to hang out and accompany yourself with friends.The academics are challenging which is good, because it can outstandingly help with your learning capabilities. Although, the downside to this school is for many classes there are an excessive amount of homework, the hallways are tightly cramped. causing students to be late to class, some teachers treat their students unfairly than others, there is a slight insect problems in the basement and 3rd floor, since this building is shared with an elementary school you will be most likely encounter many young children. I honestly give hopes to this school because it has a perfect balance between academics and the arts program "", ""You will never find another school like New Voices. It looks like every other school on the outside, but on the inside, it's something special. It doesn't always look pretty, but it's the people inside that count.

They just want to get to know your child a little bit through the interview and audition process.  You do not have to be experienced in your talents you are audition for.  They just want to see that your child is excited about the arts and willing to learn.

See Part II below.', 'Please consider putting your general observations about evaluating good middle schools into a news op-ed!', 'This is Part II of the DL on evaluating middle schools:\n\nUltimately, in middle school you have 2 goals as a parent. \n\n(Goal 1) Be  vigilante about the drug/drinking/digital device addiction culture. Contrary to preconceptions, it is not children from under-resourced households who present the greatest risk for these behaviors, it is children from middle class and prosperous homes whose parents are neglectful that present the greatest risk. Those children have the resources to bully other children into poor behavior and they try. Their parents are the ones talking about “good parenting” while in reality both parents work their butts off to pay for summer vacations in Europe while they let digital devices and too much pocket change babysit their latchkey kids. District 15 has many super ambitious families like this and these parents just hit the lottery jackpot because now their misbehaved children have a better chance to get into middle schools because the behavioral assessments were removed. Do not believe what the middle schools may tell you about their “safe” school, etc. All middle schools have drug/device problems, but the schools without behavior assessments had it far worse, but it is always concealed from public view. In one year you will believe me.\n(Goal 2) Pay attention to the development of critical thinking in your child. Your children’s straight A’s in middle school will only open the door to an interview and assessment test seat for a top high school in NYC. If your child’s straight A’s reflect his/her ability to parrot back what they were taught, it is too late in 8th grade to teach your kid to be curious and think critically using a solid foundation of facts and skills. Your kid will not get a seat at those elite high schools. You cannot prep that kind of critical thinking. It is learned in school and at home. period.\n\nBeware the middle schools that place your kid in some kind of team learning group or crew for a whole year. Strong students will be placed with weaker students to help the weaker learners. This is the school wanting your child to do the school’s job for them. Learning groups are fine but should be rotated regularly. Bright children should NOT be placed to help weaker students. The strong student simply does not progress the way they could. Instead the stronger and weaker students should each be given differentiated instruction so they get an education appropriate for their needs. One group is not more deserving than the other. That is simply equity in education. Wait until halfway through 6th grade and your strong student comes home complaining about the misbehaved student in their group who does not work and your kid does all the work. If you have a bright kid, this WILL happen---it’s just that in an equitable arrangement, the kids switch groups. Lock a strong kid in with a misbehaved kid all year in a group of 4 or 5…that’s just pure torture and you will be beside yourself. MS 447 uses these groups. It’s a fact of life in middle school. But…MS 447 rotates them frequently, thank goodness. Your kid’s misery will be short-lived. \n\nAll of us veteran parents in the district have a clear sense of which middle schools are the rote memorization traditional schools, which combine critical thinking with a strong practice on foundational skills and facts, and the schools falling somewhere on the curve in between.

I spoke with the 9th grade science teacher at the school and he said outright that his students were not capable of writing such a report. The buck stops with the parent.

I used to go to middle school here and graduated recently. This is going to be a extremely long rant/block of text and I don\'t really expect anyone to read it in its entirety and depth but I just want to get my thoughts out there. I\'m going to be brutally honest in this review.\n\nI have a lot of things to say about MS.447 - both good and bad things. I\'m going to start with the pros.\n\nFirst off, MS.447 has a lot to offer and you can capitalize on them - both academic opportunities and resources. Eighth graders can take up to three regents: Living Environment, Algebra, and U.S. History. There are also four talents you can choose from, Spanish starting in seventh grade, and an Technology program. The quiet room and tech room are also great resources for printing, doing work, etc. The music room, art room, and dance room are all well stocked and pretty nice. There\'s also the SONYC after school program, which is kind of all of the school\'s clubs meshed into one. Also, there\'s a rather interesting Exploration program, which you can love or you can hate.\n\nNow, onto the atmosphere. There\'s kind of this nice blend at MS.447 combining a chill setting with getting work done. The school is for the most part pretty diverse but I feel like Asians, brown people, and Hispanics are kind of unrepresented. I looked at the inside stats and I feel like they are kind of skewed but I\'ll get into that later.\n\nOk, now onto everything else. I\'m going to format it in\n1. what I liked about it\n2. my comments\n3. advice I would give to current students\n\nI\'m going to start with the academic work here, the biggest thing.\n\n1. As I mentioned earlier, there\'s this kind of a nice blend of a chill setting with getting work done. Also, there are chances for accelerated regents courses in eighth grade and interesting miscellaneous classes (Talent, Spanish, Tech, Art, and Exploration).\n\n2. Ok some comments. I feel like in a sense the teachers kind of hype everything up, especially with some teachers giving extremely unnecessary long speeches about life skills and discipline. A lot of teachers excessively gave these speeches and they were annoying. The teachers are for the most part extremely nice and willing to help though.\n\nThe work here is actually extremely easy - there should no reason why you would fall behind. All you need to do is pay attention in class and do the work. You can literally BS everything and I would actually advise doing so. You save so much time and effort and can still get insanely good grades. Everything you learn in class throughout the whole year can be summed into a few pages. Class consists of a lot of discussions, context, worktime, groupwork, and just doing nothing. Homework and projects should be quick - don\'t spend too much time on them.\nI\'ll talk more about the different classes later.\n\n3. Advice\n- Classes are kind of a joke. Chill and don\'t be too stressed like I was.\n- To do well, just pay attention in class and make sure the content makes sense. Tbh you don\'t even have to take notes if you don\'t want to - just understand the material.\n- If you get the material, just BS/rush through your classwork/HW. Write a lot - teachers don\'t really care and will give you full credit if you write a lot. Quantity is key.\n- Participate bc it\'s a big part of your grade. Answer the easy questions, say random stuff, do what you gotta do.\n\nOk next topic, specific classes.\n\n1. I like the range of classes you can take: the four core subjects, language, talent, tech, and exploration.\n\n2. Comments.\n\nThe four core subjects are kind of self explanatory. You learn some and then most of class is spent doing worksheets, group work, or discussions. Spanish is kind of the same but it\'s kind of a gas. Nobody really learns anything. Classes are so infrequent and it\'s just learning a word here and there. Tech seems like a cool idea but we literally do nothing. In sixth grade, it\'s just typing games. Seventh and eighth grade are just projects that you can do in one to two classes and them just chill for the rest of the time. In total, we only covered typing games, Scratch, Stopmotion, basic html in Code Academy, and an hour of code. You don\'t really learn anything bc classes are only once a cycle.\n\nThe four talents are art, dance, drama, and music. You try all four in sixth grade and then choose one to continue in seventh grade. I don\'t really know that much about art and dance but they have nice rooms. Art gives homework and tests, and dance makes you do a daily journal and gives projects. The drama room is super small and you don\'t really do anything.\n\nOk, I was in music so I\'m going to talk about it the most. The music room is extremely well stocked. There were a lot of instruments: piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, recorder, clarinet, sax, trumpet, trombone, tuba, guitar, percussion, and maybe a few more. The problem is we literally learned NOTHING. The teacher just made us play pieces the whole time or put us in practicing rooms.\n\nNow to the epitome of what MS.447 is about: exploration. Tbh, I have mixed feelings about it. The whole class is so pointless and meaningless. Just BS your work and enjoy the trips/free time. It\'s so cringey and the teachers give extraneous speeches about respect and life skills. The expo program has become more organized as I progressed through the grades. But that sadly means less trips and more time stuck in class listening to certain expo teachers drown on in directionless rants.\n\n3. Ok seem what I meant about a long block of text? Here\'s some advice:\n- A lot of the classes are so pointless. Just BS your work, soak in what you want, and chill.\n- If you\'re in music and a beginner, work hard and self teach yourself with the books which are actually pretty good. Future you will thank you.\n\nLastly, I wanna talk about the whole experience of going to MS.447. I\'m just going to skip to comments.\n\n2. Some comments.\n\nThere are social groups present. Everybody kind of forms their group of friends (""squad"") midway through sixth grade. You\'re stuck with your official class for 90% of the day and that can be frustrating. I feel that groups are usually divided by race and gender. Popularity is kind of a thing and since it\'s such a small school, everybody knows about everything.\n\nNow, the experience of going to MS.447. Tbh it\'s honestly really sketchy. The area around it is not the safest and the school has more than a few incidents of sketchy stuff. The high school downstairs doesn\'t help. In my time at MS.447, we had 2 bomb threats, a fire in the auditorium, occasional metal detectors, and a few fights in the high school downstairs.\n\nOk now MS.447 kind of overdoes its ""No place for hate"" anti-bullying shenanigans. It kind of gets overly excessive, cringey, and annoying. It gets to the point where we talk about this ode on half days, peace and diversity day, and in advisory. It\'s so pointless and nobody really cares - bullying is not a big deal in school. While bullying is not present, I do admit that subtle racism is. Kids can be pretty ignorant as in probably in any other school.\n\nOk now onto after school stuff. Since 2014, SONYC has kind of been the main thing and it\'s ok but tbh, you can\'t really do much in terms of extracurriculars here. Robotics, computer programming, gardening, etc. are all kind of pointless and just chill time. You gotta do stuff outside of school if you wanna do some extracirriculars, pursue some hobbies, etc. Some of the more legit stuff are yearbook, basketball, wrestling, soccer (somewhat), and student government.\n\n3. Advice\n- Life is life lol\n\nOk. I think I\'m done with my excessive rant. Probably no one bothered to read it in its entirety but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. (This took about an hour for anybody curious but it\'s winter break, yay!)', ""Hello past MS 447 student\n\nI am an 8th grader now and I would like to expand on your conversation. First off I agree about expo. I think it truly can be an amazing program and be really engaging, however, it needs to be worked on. I think it is the curriculum, even though, like you said it currently gets increasingly organized, it is still jumbled. Many times in a unit you learn the same thing over and over and it is very repetitive; the things that are important and very fun are often quickly rushed through. I partly blame the teachers, since in expo you are moving from class to class the teachers in your new class don't know what really happened in the previous one so sometimes you learn the same thing twice.\n\nAdditionally, the expo teacher I have at the moment have split the class up by race, which worries me. He is a new teacher and only came this year. I noticed this on a trip when they asked us to group into our table groups, he then split us up into 2 full groups with 2 table in each group. I quickly realized that all of the hispanics, asians, and african-americans were on this same side and all of the caucasians were on one side. We just did a topic on bioethics and has to construct a lesson to the class - my topic was abortion. I wish they used some of the tips they gave us in our lessons into some of their own, to make them a little more exciting.\n\nLike you said earlier the drama in MS 447 isn't terrible. There isn't really any bullying, yes there is some teasing, but I don't think any MS 447 student truly wants to hurt someone. And, even if they did our school has very extreme measures for bullying. Many times students will get in-school suspension. However, when there are some issues: when there is a shred of drama or conflict it explodes all over our school. Since it is relatively small, news travels fast. And sometimes the teachers find about it too AND PAIR YOU WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND *cough* expo teachers *cough*. But it all depends on who you hang out with.\n\nMS 447 has rigorous programs. It depends on how much you will push yourself. If you end up getting into the Algebra Regents track it will be difficult to keep up if you are not entirely on task. If you kind of breeze through it you would end up with low 60s. However, if you push yourself you could get 98s. It all depends on the workload you choose to do.\n\nThe guidance counselors are excellent. Ms. Katz is amazing. She made the terrifyingly grueling middle school transition much easier. I was able to go into meetings with her and talk to her during lunch. She answered all my questions and is very chill.\n\nTech is different now that you are gone. Mr. McCollum left and now Mr. Loize is the teacher. It is very different know and much more organized. However, I will always miss Mr. McCollum because he was one of the teachers that could understand teenage pubescent hormone filled brains. We are doing a lot of Java and just completed identity safety on social media. My class is progressing much faster than my old class with Mr. McCollum.\n\nI am also in music, *digital high five* and it is extremely boring. However, I have to give Mr. Mullins credit for buying the right books. I started my instrument in the middle of 6th grade and now in the beginning of 8th grade I am able to play high school and college level pieces. However, he needs to get new sheet music, I am so sick of Morning, Largo and Finale. We play those songs on repeat and we still sound horrible. I think there should be some system.\n\nBut then again MS 447 is a great school, I have not even mentioned all the great things academically about it. If someone wants me too I will but I did write a little tidbit for Brooklynparent601 right below this.\n\nP.S. I read your entire thing :)"", 'How much individual attention do the general education kids get from teachers?

I wanted to add a review of the school as we get lots of questions about it.\n\nI\'ll start by saying that we love BCS - we picked it because of the social justice/interesting curriculum, the small class size, small school size, the intentionally integrated environment, and emphasis on social emotional development (which as a 2nd time middle school parent I think is the #1 most important aspect of the middle school experience). \n\nThe academics are not easy and there isn\'t grade inflation - but they\'re not super hard-driving either. Very little homework, which we\'re grateful for. If your kid is off the charts academically, the projects are interesting and you spend a lot of time thinking about the ""why"" of your learning, but you won\'t get pushed.  I get the feeling that there\'s a lot of diversity in how well the kids perform in a class - and there\'s acceptance of that by the teachers, so that kids don\'t feel they have to give up on themselves if they\'re getting a C (which BCS labels ""competent""). We have been frustrated with the new grading system and online communication about it but the administration was quick to respond to parent issues and make changes when it was clear it wasn\'t working. \n\nDiscipline at the school seems pretty fair. There\'s restorative justice which they really believe in and practice whole heartedly.\n\nHighlights for my child\nDebate - my child has been competing and winning a lot of trophies and awards - really stretches their confidence and intellectual reasoning ability. Also fun and team-oriented. \n\nGay Straight Alliance - child participates in this club and gets a lot out of being an ally to this community. Last winter, my kid participated in the largest, youth LGTBQ+ rally held at Stuyvesant HS, drawing GSA clubs from all over the city. \n\nSoccer - In 6th grade, my child got to school at 7AM 3 days a week to play on an indoor co-ed team. \n\nExpeditionary Thursdays - it\'s fun and interesting for the kids to engage in applied learning activities every other week. Also bonding. \n\nCrew is a safe place and allows my child to develop relationships across many barriers that don\'t often get crossed. And the crew teacher texts with me all the time - nights/weekends - discussion of picayune social stuff, texting pictures from the school dance, etc. I feel very safe and comfortable talking to him about anything and love that.', ""I am the parent of a 7tth grader at BCS.

My 6th grader loves school so much that he asks to be woken up early to arrive well before school starts (this def did not happen in his elementary days)! The teachers and staff respect and listen to students. The small class sizes are a godsend and almost unheard of in an NYC public school. The school prioritizes that and it makes a difference. The school follows the EL Education model of expeditionary learning, and student led inquiry, along with a Crew model (small group of 12-14 kids plus one advisor who meet for 30 mins daily for social/emotional/team building support). They ask students to take ownership of their work and learning - while constantly receiving support and guidance from teachers (Motto: ""We are crew, not passengers""). The school holds SLCs -Student Led conferences - where students present and reflect on their work to their parents and teachers (rather than Parent-Teacher Conferences that leave the student out).

Collaboration is a core principle of the school - students learn how to work with others in teams and group work, which IMO is very important in life.\n\nNote if you are looking at the ""How do students perform academically"" section above, which is based on the NYState test scores  - the State now gives the lowest rank to students who Opt Out as a way to punish schools with a high Opt Out rate (it used to be logged as N/A, but starting in 2018 the state decided to give a 0-1 score for students not taking the test). Even though NYC City Council and ESSA have reaffirmed that parents have the right to opt their children out of state tests, the state is trying to make a point. Brooklyn Collaborative had an 80% Opt out rate in 2018. So take that section/those scores with a grain of salt.

Again, not what was planned or adopted.', ""this reply is very illuminating.  my son just completed 8th grade and will continue next year as a 9th grader.  he's a francophone kid from flatbush and i have to say, i have absolutely noticed the disconnect you bring up in your post.\n\n\ni'm really uncomfortable with the shift in demographic this school has undergone in the past 3 years, but, after this 8th grade remote learning fiasco,  it's our son's best option for continuity and stability.  primarily because of this extremely overbearing focus on recruiting non-french speaking park slope and DUMBO kids, i feel my son is really not receiving the french language  instructions we expected, so we heavily compensate at home by playing a lot of french movies, speaking french in general conversation and spending time in francophone countries.  \n\n\n\ni've also spent a lot of time during this remote learning year making sure my kid is prepared for the regents exams and psat's.  i've gotten a few notices about these tests, but i would expect a lot more involvement from the school.  i really feel like i need to either instruct my child on his own or pay for a kaplan or princeton review course.  if our kids' performance on these semi-useless tests is so important for funding, they need to be more proactive in offering after school tutoring or discount courses."", ""I'm sure the school will do their best once kids are admitted, but the Diversity Plan couldn't be clearer on this point.   \n\nFrom the plan:  Allow elementary students who have completed a dual language program to be automatically eligible for middle school dual language programs. Utilize a transparent & objective assessment to determine bi-literacy for new students entering a middle school dual language program.\nFrom the directory (post-adoption of plan): Program Eligibility: Open to students and residents of Brooklyn who currently attend an elementary-level French Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Education program, or who have academic proficiency in both English and French.\n\nIt's frustrating that the DOE and the school won't acknowledge the issue or apologize to the families who were caught up in this this year.   But stakeholders who worked hard to get this into the plan - written in the plainest language possible - are hopeful it will be better implemented next year.  We are working to make that happen.  And we're working to make sure the next point is also executed (Encourage the citywide School Diversity Advisory Group to research & explore the impacts of Dual Language programs as they relate to school diversity & integration).  Spanish speaking kids should have access to MS 88's language program.  French speaking kids should have access to BHS's program.   This is why there ARE these two borough-wide programs in D15.   I hope BHS joins this effort. \n\nFinally, this isn't a screen.   It is a program priority eligibility category.  And they are an important part of The Diversity Plan.   They include geography, language, and students with physical disabilities (who have priority to barrier free schools)."", ""if they effectively enacted that type of plan, all these kids from park slope and dumbo who don't speak french at all wouldn't be eligible for this school.  2018, when my son was admitted to 6th grade, seems to be the last year that they actually tested children on their ability to speak french.  since then, they've accepted too many kids who don't speak french, pretty much eliminated all effective french language programming (especially after school offerings) and cut out classes like french language science classes.  it's basically an english speaking school masquerading as a dual-language program.  because of this, we've doubled down at home to try to get our kid to speak french as much as possible.  that's what we're supposed to do as parents, but it's disappointing that we can't trust his dual language school to actually instruct him in two languages."", 'What does it mean that this school has been added to the list of struggling schools? \nhttps://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2019/01/17/struggling-schools-nyc-essa/', ""I think you need to re-read the article.

Thanks Insideschools for the update.', 'My daughter is in 6th grade and is just about to finish her first year at BHIS – Boerum Hill School for International Studies (formerly SIS). In the fall of 5th grade during middle school tours, BHIS was not even on my radar and I didn’t even list it as a choice.  Later, I heard some parents who had gone on tours mentioning how impressed they were, but by the time I wanted to go on a tour, they were finished.  Luckily, the school was trying to put together a dual language French program and by early Spring was able to confirm the program would be offered.  That meant the DLP program/school was listed on the new schools application form and we applied under that. So, we ended up being in the very lucky position to have actually had the choice between MS51 and BHIS.  MS51 is an excellent school\nand I went back and forth trying to decide, but in the end I decided BHIS was a\nbetter fit for my daughter. It took a great leap of faith because the program\nis new, but now I am so glad I made that choice. My daughter has blossomed at\nBHIS, academically, emotionally, and socially. Her confidence has soared.  What I love about the program is that students are encouraged to think critically, take risks, and ask questions. In the beginning I was worried whether she was getting enough content because it is a bit harder to gauge compared to a traditionally structured school. ELA and Social Studies are integrated, for example. \nHowever, I think she has received an education equal to the top middle\nschools. Her twin brother is enrolled at Twain so I have been able to compare\nthem side by side throughout the year. In certain areas I think Twain went into\na little more depth but not by a whole lot. Twain is a well-oiled and smoothly\nrun school as it has many years under its belt. BHIS does have some growing\npains but this is to be expected.  The principal, Ms. Juman, is simply AMAZING! She is truly open to parent feedback and suggestions. Any time I have had a problem she has responded immediately and worked to fix it. The school accepts 6th graders who are both beginner and advanced French speakers. During French class they are separated according to ability. This is the only time they are separated.  In all other classes they are mixed which is great and helps build community.  Even during the extended day French classes (2:45-4:00) they are mixed and each student is expected to participate according to their ability. These classes include debate, choir, cooking, theatre, digital storytelling, and soccer. So, they are doing all these fun things but learning the corresponding French vocabulary as they go along. What I am really excited about is high school at BHIS. BHIS middle school students will have priority to attend the high school which will\nbe offering the rigorous and prestigious International Baccalaureate. IB\nprograms are strictly vetted by some international organization that oversees\nthese diplomas, and schools have to prove they meet these standards before\nbeing approved as an IB school.  BHIS is very close to obtaining this approval.', 'My daughter loves it here.  She is being challenged, but she is still interested.  The kids are all nice kids and there is a nice community at this school.  I, personally, also love that the school is so diverse.  \n\nThe extended day French has been fantastic.  The kids are doing digital storytelling, cooking and sports in French extended day.  The school is very open and communicative to the parents.  The Vice Principal Nicole knows every student in the middle school.  And, somehow, my daughter is able to speak some French.  I love that this school will make her a well rounded person as so many of the other middle schools just focus on one discipline or another.  It is a sweet school and we are so happy.  I have seen my daughter become very confident and comfortable in her own skin. ', ""My son started 6th grade at SIS this year, and we LOVE this school.  The academics are rigorous and the teachers are motivated and have high expectations for the kids.  My son is challenged and enthusiastic about learning here.  It appears statistics posted are somewhat outdated and do not reflect the recent institution of the IB program.  My son's experience, thus far, is that he has educators who are genuinely interested in teaching and are able to motivate him.  This year, he has come to love and be excited by math, is reading and writing at an accelerated level, has found a science teacher who shares his passion for amphibians and reptiles and seems to have learned more French in the last 3 months than I was able to learn in 6 years of foreign language classes when I was a kid; he also rushes to be at school at 7 am three days a week to be able to participate in early morning soccer.  There is a tremendous emphasis on community, and the school embraces parent engagement and is genuinely interested in parent involvement.  I find this to be a huge plus, and is something that sets SIS apart from other middle schools we viewed."", 'This is our second year that my daughter is attending The School of International Studies and all I can say is it has been a wonderful enriching experience. The amount of support and effort that the entire community has put forth is amazing. This year a French dual language program was rolled out in the middle school and there are plans to roll this out in the high school as well. I truly support the IB curriculum and look forward to my daughter continuing this educational experience when she attends SIS during her high school years.', ""I'm the parent of a 6th Grader who came from PS58 and am very impressed with International Studies.

15K839,"['yeye', 'I am currently an 8th grade student at this school. The pros: Ms839 has great academics, the teachers are all great, students can do dissections in as early as 7th grade. There is a lot of choice in the classes you take. The cleanliness of the building makes the school a pleasant place to learn. The advisory groups are fun and help kids make friends and feel like they have allies in the school that will support them. In 8th grade students are guided through the high school application process. There is a great sense of community at the school. Teachers are very supportive and will help you whenever you need as long as you are proactive. The cons: If your student wants to get great grades in 7th grade to impress prestigious high schools, the extra credit work and regular homework will be stressful, and in order to improve their grades the student will have to be very proactive. Very often strong opinions are mixed into topics like immigration during humanities classes; for example, my humanities teachers have at times given us obviously biased articles that clearly support open borders. While I don\'t necessarily disagree with the articles, I don\'t think they should be used educationally if they are argumentative. The last con is that the ""Morning meetings"" can at times feel like ""far left"" democratic meetings. Most of them talk about how we need to believe certain things. For example, there was once a teacher that said we should support native americans by putting signs on all buildings that said ""This is native land"". ANYWAY, despite the schools cons this school is overall a school that provides great education and a supportive teaching staff.', ""MS 839 is everything I could have hope for in a middle school for my daughter. It's the best-in-class education, administered by a caring and exceptional staff, supported by a diverse and unparalleled sense of community. My 6 grade daughter has become such a deep and critical thinker. She is extremely excited to go to school everyday (of course the brand new shinny, brightly lit building doesn't hurt) and then come home to share her experiences. She has meet so many wonderful friends. She can't tell me who her favorite teacher is because she loves them all. Social acceptance is very important at the school and the support for the LGBTQ community is awesome. The curriculum engaging, challenging and fun. MS 839 engages in much more than quantifiable academics. They also include creativity,  empathy, emotional intelligence, socialization all of which is just as important as academics. Michael, the principal, knows all the students by name and Lauren, the assistance principal, is the most happy, lovable and positive AP that I have ever met. My only regret is that the school doesn't go though to the 12 grade."", ""I thought it was time, as a current 8th grade parent, to update my comments.\nWe are still thrilled about the school!  I feel like all the things I said two years ago are still true.  Interesting curriculum, diversity, super dedicated staff and teachers, responsiveness... Now I'm on my 2nd year as a member of the SLT (school leadership team).  It's been a great experience and I find that there is amazing respect for our input and working with Lauren (Shookoff, the AP) is an education in organization!  One of my interests has been working on incorporating teaching executive functioning, organization and time management skills into the curriculum.  The spirit was willing at the beginning but the structure was week.  We did a lot of work last year and my sense is that most of the work has seen fruition in the 6th grade.  I'm a bit frustrated not to have seen a big change for the 8th graders but I do understand that, since the school is new and there is so much planning for curriculum and projects, this is difficult to execute fully for those of us who 'pioneered'.  I hope we're leaving the school in a stronger place there.\nMy one other concern is this - the homework was really manageable in 6th grade, got more appropriately more involved in 7th grade, but is seaming a bit sparse in the 8th grade.  It's still meaningful; no BS work.  And they do have some double periods (including a study hall) where they can do some work, I just worry a bit that my son won't be prepared for the total over-work of high school.  Mind you, as someone who works with honors students in a college, high schoolers often have more volume of work than college students.\nAnyway, those are the only concerns I have.  I still love the school, I love the administration, I love the teachers, I love hanging out with the other parents in our happy hours, and I'm going to be really sad leaving the school!!\nOh, and while my son is still very close with his elementary school friends, he has a nice, diverse bunch of friends from 839 too.\nI would still (and do still) recommend the school wholeheartedly!"", 'Hi My daughter was match with MS 839. Can a student/parent please share their experience so far with the school?', 'Principal Perlberg <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/brooklyn-district-shifts-blind-rankings-middle-school-admissions"">tells SchoolBook</a> why District 15\'s new blind admissions process makes sense.', 'One more point... The homework is completely manageable, reasonable and relevant. No busy work!', ""We feel like we've won the lottery with ms 839! Pun intended.\n\nCurriculum:\nThe expeditionary, projects-based curriculum is so well integrated. No subject is left behind and that clearly helps to keep both the students and faculty and administrators excited and working as a team. As some have said, it doesn't look like the traditional kind of challenging but it is challenging and it encourages a kind of critical thinking that you won't find in many middle schools. Next unit: motion and forces (I may be putting that wrong) and they are building bicycles! Feel free to donate to the bike kit drive!\nTeachers:\nWow. The teachers are so excited and smart and dedicated! The other day at the play I was sitting in front of them all at the play. They were howling with laughter and commenting with such appreciation at each of the kids on stage. You could tell that they had genuine relationships with them. We have emailed many of the teachers with questions and concerns and they are always thoughtful in their answers. The other day a grown up asked our son who was his favorite teacher and he couldn't answer. There are no bad eggs! Of course Lauren and Michael are extremely impressive and passionate about the school they are building.\nAs it is a new school there are going to be bumps and missteps along the way (nothing big) but the point is that Michael always asks for feedback and is genuine in his efforts to incorporate suggestions. The dedication to community building and responsibility is real.\nAnother part of their approach is using Restorative Justice model. One aspect of this community based approach to keeping things running smoothly and having students take responsibility for their actions is morning meeting (Quaker style) where they can celebrate someone for empathy, unity, perseverance, service or reflection. I was at one of them before a school trip and expected the students to be pretty silent. But they really bought in and what they had to say about each other actually made me cry. And they were clearly not just talking about their close friends. I think that this kind of getting to know and think about people at this crucial stage of development will last them a life time.\nI agree with the comment below about the level of discipline being not what a 321 (or in my case 107) parent would be used to. It is a new challenge for my son.  But I also think that kids need to be able to adapt to different environments. And the many kids of diversity that 839 offers is nothing that you can find in rarified Park Slope.  The other challenge is PTA  fundraising... so if you can help with that, c'mon! You won't be sorry! We are really happy with our choice!"", 'As a relatively uninvolved parent, I couldn’t be happier with MS 839.  Meaning, as someone who fails to participate in helping the school through PTA or any other kind of guidance, my spouse and I ride on the coattails of all the fine parents that do contribute their time.  And our child is not vocal, or excited enough about school, to immerse us in the daily curriculum.  So that being said, to qualify much of what I don’t know about the school academically, I can still endorse what you’ve seen here from other parents recently.  The “expedition”, inter-disciplinary approach seems to engage the students, and the ""crew"" advisory system works well.\n\nThe youth, intelligence and vitality of the faculty and administration is impressive.  The small size of the school is crucial, and the building is fantastic.  The facilities really reflect the people involved to create an impression of a very advanced, modern program.  The faculty are responsive to individual inquiries and requests.  And yet it’s all done in what feels like a one-room-schoolhouse environment.\n\nIt is not a conventionally challenging school such as MS 51.  I don’t believe that a parent or student interested in a competitive, high-achievement environment will find this school appealing.  It is much more nurturing than that.  The discipline needs of many students may make for a society not as well-behaved as a PS 321 parent would be used to, also.\n\nOur family all feel extremely lucky to be at 839, and especially in these first years - it’s exciting.', ""if you can't get more involved please send money!"", 'Our daughter is currently in the inaugural class of MS 839, grade 6, entering grade 7 in the fall. She loves the school and so do we! The school is very inclusive and diverse, and most importantly, and probably because of the diversity, it\'s a kind school. The kids do many projects together, so this probably helps with the feeling of acceptance in the school community. Our daughter is a pretty sensitive kid and feels that her needs are being considered and that she\'s valued and respected as an individual. Unlike so many schools, it\'s not a stressful environment. This is pretty key for learning. You just have to stand in the courtyard as kids are let out to see the difference. \n\nThe kids feel very comfortable with the principal who has an open-door policy, and they seem to really like the teachers too. I never hear about the ""bad"" teacher because there aren\'t any. If kids have issues with one another, they go in for mediation to learn how to make things right. The social-emotional needs are definitely met for these kids and that\'s the toughest part. \n\nAcademically, I\'d say science, ELA and theater are very strong, and math is a little weaker, only because it seems that a lot of kids need extra help. However, they can get free out-of-school help twice a week, or more, if needed. All the teachers really bend over backwards to make sure the kids succeed. They just put on one of the funniest, most polished student plays I\'ve ever seen, and they are about to publish children\'s books about the Gowanus Canal, incorporating what they learned in science about the canal  and storytelling in ELA. They do a lot of cross-over in subjects to bring meaning and context to what they are learning. It\'s very impressive. I highly recommend this school for one of your top picks.', 'Our daughter was offered a seat at this school, are there any parents/students that can share their experience?', ""Hi Ray, I'm the parent of an MS 839 6th grader. For our daughter and our family, 839 has been a spectacular experience this year. The degree of personal attention from classroom and crew teachers, the immersive and field-based learning programs, the beautiful facility, and the emerging extracurricular/Afterschool lineup have all come together to create a warm, accessible and friendly school that feels like it's been a part of the community for years. (Even the PTA meetings are fun! And so are the parent/staff happy hours.)\n\nOur daughter enjoys every subject, and she was thrilled to participate in the spring play just this week. She's active in the peer mediation club and enjoys good relationships with all of her (young, energetic, innovative) teachers. And the whole family benefits from the rationalized 9 am start time.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the school evolves with an expanded staff and a class  of 7th graders (and eventually 8th graders). Academic depth and homework amounts may increase for the upper classes. And the appropriate resources and support from DOE will be critical to sustain the high quality of the program so far. Nevertheless, I have a lot of confidence in Michael Perlberg and his hand-picked staff to adapt, expand and improve MS 839 in the years ahead.\n\nI'm happy to chat further or to introduce you to other current parents if you like. You can reach me at miketrose (at) gmail."", ""That's fantastic Mike, Thank you for sharing what makes MS 839 so great. We have had to choose between this school and BUGS and feel this school may be the better fit for her. Thanks again."", ""MS 839 is exceptional in every regard. Principal Michael Perlberg and Assistant Principal Lauren Shookhoff have recruited and lead an incredible team of teachers and administrators. Collectively, they have seized the opportunity to create a progressive school that engages, supports, and motivates students more effectively than any of the middle schools we considered.\n\nAs a new school with generally younger teachers, MS 839 is run by people eager to create a school that excels, without carrying the legacy baggage that comes with many older schools. Anyone who has witnessed the yelling, outdated thinking, and sheer exhaustion of teachers and staff at some other schools will appreciate the optimistic, engaged, and entirely dedicated educators at MS 839. \n\nTeachers and administrators apply the best, most current methods of teaching and management to give each student the greatest advantage possible, both in and outside of the classrooms.\n\nTheater, arts, and physical education are highly valued at MS 839, and a truly interdisciplinary approach to education enhances connections between arts and sciences. \n\nBy starting the school day later than other schools, at 9:00, students are also more likely to be focused and engaged at the start of each day. The one big drawback to a later school day is that afternoon schedules can be more challenging, especially because many programs depend on all schools letting out earlier.\n\nWith a greater budget for facilities and services, MS 839 would compete well with many private schools. Considering all of the academic, social, and personal factors, I prefer MS 839 over any of the nearby private schools for our child.\n\nIt's a shame that parents throughout Brooklyn have to choose between either great or awful schools, with very little in between. And of course several never even look at your application if it is chosen as #2. With everyone competing for a very few top choices, making 839 your #1 or #2 pick while it is still a new school may give you a advantage."", ""That is OK @nycparent   I don't think this school is interested in turning it into another 51."", ""Here's the problem: It's a random lottery so nobody is going to squander a #1 or #2 choice on this school when other schools won't even look at you if you don't rank them high. I suspect that makes them less likely to attract high-achieving students who don't want to eliminate alternatives. Too bad. I like the philosophy."", ""We ranked only 3 schools. BSI as our blind choice, MS839 as #1 & MS51 #2. My child has 4s across the board, both in academics and behavior, great attendance and gets along great with others both young and old. She would have done great at 51 and been able to handled the load. And I'm more than sure if she didn't get into 839 that 51 would not have let her slip away. Some parents of high achievers are more concern about their child's happiness along with the state of the world & I would hope to think that I'm right to assume that 839 is a place that is  educating  great children and meeting their needs so that they can all see that they are all high achievers. Their are many great school but allot of them are llacking the charm that 839 seems to have & that this age group so desperately could benefit from. Our world is changing and our educators need to catch up. I'm excite to know that my child will be part of the early growth of this community being the high achiever that she is\n"", 'My son is a high achieving student with all 4s, and we liked 839 so much that we ranked it in one of our top two spots. I was worried that if we did not rank it in the top two, that he would miss his chance of getting into 839 because he would be accepted into another school in our top two spots. So, I risked putting it up there because we wanted it over other schools we toured. I was really worried that we might have messed up by doing so, but, in the end, I decided to do an ""honest"" list. Since we honestly wanted 839 as a top choice, we put it there. He was lucky enough to get a spot. Now, I am really glad I took that risk.', ""The lottery doesn't discourage high-achieving students from applying; what it does is incentivize them to rank it lower than they might otherwise. The lottery includes all students who apply, regardless of where they rank the school.... but a student selected for the lottery will only be paired with MS 839 if she didn't get selected for a school she ranked higher."", 'That\'s tantamount to the same thing. Any kid who\'s defined as ""high-achieving"" is going to have a very solid shot at a selective school. Those schools, in turn, are so overwhelmed with applications that they will only look at kids who rank them top of the list. My son was quite interested in 839 but we both thought it was foolish to waste a #1 or #2 spot on a school that enters everyone in a blind lottery. The odds of not getting in could be high, leaving him with no spot there and one less opportunity to go for a selective school. Every one of his friends made the same choice. The net result, I think, is that 839 will not get as many kids who perform above grade level. Why gamble on a lottery ticket if it means giving up a shot to win an equally coveted spot down the street?', 'This is a very real problem.  Given the lottery-based admission, I really think MS839 should be considered ""blind choice"" like Mark Twain and BSI.  Unfortunately, this may be one of these situations where the problem doesn\'t get identified by the DOE proactively and only gets addressed for future years.', 'I believe district 15 will begin (across the board) a blind MS admission starting next year :))', 'The 106 8th graders in  MS 389\'s inaugural class come from ten different middle schools, making for a diverse mix of academic levels, ethnicities and first languages.

16K005,"['PS 5 is our zone school and my son transferred there in 3rd grade after not being able to get the support he needed elsewhere. From my first interaction with the school, I found the teachers and administrators to be welcoming and supportive. Upper grade students have access to technology, college prep and STEM courses. Students are groomed to develop confidence in their leadership skills by being nominated to serve as school representatives or leading a class activity with their peers. As a parent, I appreciated the open door policy and felt that my input as a parent was valued. I also participated in the free parent leadership workshops that were led by Dr. Angela Moses on Saturday mornings. Since graduating from 5th grade last year, my son and his friends remain in contact with their PS 5 teachers and coaches due to the strong bond they have built. PS 5 was a wonderful learning environment for my son both socially and academically.

Children at P.S. 5 as young as 10-years-old are already entrepreneurs.

This happens quite a bit.  In these same classrooms, students are left with paraprofessionals.  This also happens quite a bit.   The school lacks discipline and order with children fighting in front of school safety. And school safety will wait for a teacher to respond.   The administration is unscrupulous.  They pit staff members against staff members.  They hire unlicensed “teachers.”  During dance class, students jump around to popular music.  The dance instructor does not go beyond the scope of rap and popular songs.  When you enter PS 5, you are greeted by wbls playing popular rap and r&b.  There is a problem with mice abs cockroaches.

An example I can give is I got a phone call from the gym teacher (they have gym everyday at PS5): she tells me, do you want to see your child run the warm up session tomorrow?\nOf course I said yes, we went with my wife, and we saw our little girl directing her classmates how to shake their legs, and jump in the air... The teacher rotates who does this, and I think it is a great soft skills learning lesson.\nThis year is not over yet, but we had at least two field trips per month, all free, welcoming parents to chaperon. I have been happilly surprised that many parents are participating to these trips, making a nice community feeling.\nAnswering to the review of the school by this website, I don't think it gives a true feeling of what the school does offer for us families and for our children.\nI think the leadership is well aware of some weaknesses of the school, and nobody is perfect. But I can see this school on a well upward trend. \nA dual language program is being launched for september 2018. My feeling is that it will help the school mingle current students with some other stuents part of the gentrification wave that the area experiences.\nI am a strong supported of this program, and I will try to make sure that everyone benefits from it. \nLast think I want to say is regarding the review quoting shelter students accounting for bad stats for attendance. True or not, I would say that you can't tell from any student who is in a shelter or not. And truly, that is not our business.\nThis school is a public school, who warmly welcomes childrens, whatever their social background, cultural background or color is. So for this too, I think this school rocks.\nNext year my daughter will be attending the school, in the french dual language program. I am convinced that she will learn, but she will also brings to the school. \nI give, you give, we win"", 'wop', 'I recently read the article posted by Inside Schools.

At the beginning of the year my son was not doing so well but at the end of the year and for the State Exam his progress was shown and I was very thankful to his teachers.

I believe the lunch aide's could be a little more professional when addressing students. Extracurricular: in the 2nd grade they had students go to the YMCA for swimming classes which was great. I would deft recommend the school"", 'I just have to say something because the most recent comments are so old. It’s been an interesting year (2018-2019) with  principal Brunner taking over. It does feel like there are a lot of moving pieces in the school schedule especially with repairs going on at the building, that have made certain extra-curricular activities feel inconsistent, and though I love love the activities offered by the afterschool program, the lack of focus on academics and homework is frustrating, however - the teachers make this school what it is. And it is great, according to my daughter. She is motivated and involved in class. She has learned so much and I feel she is on par with the neighbor’s child who is at a demanding charter school. The HW isn’t always an hour and a half - it depends on the teacher and my daughter has only been required to read 15minutes a day (she’s been in the school since pre-k and is going to 2nd grade next year). She is reading at nearly 3rd grade levels (2-years above) as a result. She learns so many amazing things in music and art and I believe she is becoming quite well-rounded which is what I want most for her. I want her to find her niche and her love and I think there’s room for her to do that here - and still be a great overall student. I’d highly recommend it. Her teachers have been highly involved and responsive. And my daughter is always anxious to do her best to please them. I like that. Small class size also means a lot to me. No school is perfect and i know that the school is working with a much tighter budget because the income levels in the neighborhood have risen so they get less government support. Parents must stay involved and support fundraisers to keep the school strong. I’m hoping more of the bumps will get worked out as the new principal finds his legs but he’s a great guy and very hands-on so I’m sure it will happen.', ""I have two kids in this school.  I really like Ms. Haskins, and have nothing but positive experiences with the teachers who are all deeply dedicated educators.  The limitation: I am very much against homework, particularly at this age, and there's a bounty of research now indicating it's not productive.  In fact the National Parent Teacher Association recommends no or nominal homework prior to first grade and then 10 min. of homework for each grade level so 10 min. for first graders, 20 for second etc.  Last year we found ourselves doing 2 hours or more of homework each night with our first grader and quickly grew disillusioned.  When I objected to the volume of homework Ms. Haskins and my child's teacher both took the time to meet with me and work out a fair compromise.  I think my only issue with this school is their obsession with performing on the annual standardized tests.  I feel like everything is geared toward the very narrow goal of achievement on the narrow range of topics on a handful of tests generated by politicians, bureaucrats and consultants, not educators.  The effect in my opinion is an overly narrow curriculum focused strictly on the topics tested and not a well rounded education.  I think the kids would be better served by a school where the educators are more willing to question the current system and put education above rankings but that's probably a bit much to ask of BedStuy during the current era.   Compared to most of the schools I toured this one was a dream but we might move next year since I intend to opt out of the standardized tests which will become applicable to my older child next year."", ""The complaints I have heard about Ms. Haskins all have been in response to her holding parents and students accountable for poor and/or disruptive behavior.

Great new staff and leadership.', 'The students and staff are amazing at Madiba Prep. I love this school and seeing the difference I am making. We are headed to our first international trip next week. How awesome is that!', ""Madiba Prep is an amazing school because current staff care about students and focus on their growth. It is unfortunate that some former teacher that worked there three years ago did not embrace the vision and leadership of the newly appointed Principal Malcolm and made a personal decision to work at other schools, but now choose to post hostile unsubstantiated comments. Hopefully, these former teachers will focus on their current school and improving their teaching craft to offer the best to their current students instead of misrepresenting the truth. Here is our truth: In the past two years, Madiba Prep has secured over 1.5 million grant funding, built advance science lab, upgrade outdated technology, partnered with numerous agencies, business, community partners, elected officials to provide the best educational resources/programs to a student body which has grown by 30% and hired qualified dedicated staff. It takes time to get the most qualified staff which has been successfully done in the past two years, which dramatically lowered our staff turnover rate to under 10% in 2018. All these accomplishments occurred while  we work hard to come off the focus list.(Principal Malcolm was not the principal of Madiba when it entered the state focus list, but she accepted the challenge to turn around a failing school ). Under the leadership of Principal Malcolm, we are a strong community with amazing staff and students. Come see for yourself how amazing we are and hear from current staff and students about our school community. Lastly, personal attacks are useless, insignificant and petty when we have the privilege and responsibility to service the lives of our children; let's be the example of dignity, grace and wisdom always for our children. I'm so humbled and proud of my work and the work of my administration, collegues, partners and students to transform Madiba Prep into a stellar school."", ""I'm so sorry that the disgruntal former teach is upset.

Her goal is is has always been the very best for her students (they are top priority and will always be top priority) \n\nFact 3. There has never been a 100% turnover rate under Ms. Malcolm.\n\nFact 4 If you are willing to learn, student or teacher, Madiba is the best place for growth period."", 'Clearly Malcolm’s minions are at it again!

Funny how there was no TJ working at Madiba in 2016 (I was there) yet, this “TJ” comments about the growth of the school? Ha! What a joke! The administration is corrupt. Malcolm had low enrollment at her previous school that shut down and the same is true for Madiba. I wonder why? How can a school have a gifted and talented program and failing scores? If you want your child to have a great photo opportunity then Madiba is the place for you. You want your child to be challenged and developed? Please look elsewhere!

Whenever we are in the building we are always aware of what she is doing. Ms. Malcolm has ALWAYS had our children’s best interest at heart. Her open door policy allows us to visit the school, volunteer throughout the day, and allow us to sit in our child’s class. I’ve spoken with a majority of the parents and we are all extremely happy with Principal Malcolm’s work ethics and vision for our scholars and this school. Let’s us as a parent community come together and volunteer and help out during the day, instead of tearing down the administration. So few parents are involved in volunteer service! As a parent I completely understand we have jobs and have to support our children but, in order to maintain the success of our child we must be the driving force of the schools success. The staff has always been supportive and helpful to us parents and our students. I hope to see more of us parents lending a hand and helping in the success and growth of our child’s school.

However, under the new ""leadership"" of Principal Anne Marie Malcolm the quality of the school has diminished significantly. Ms. Malcolm is rarely ever present in the building and spends her time prepping for photo opportunities instead of investing in the professional development of teachers and building relationships with students to assess their needs. The staff consists primarily of first-year teachers who are still learning the profession. The secretary is wildly unprofessional and every time I have ever visited or called the school building she is eating, laughing, talking loudly or being generally inappropriate. I regret sending my child to this school and will be transferring my son out before the school gets closed down for poor leadership and under enrollment.

17K289,"[""After many years of inefficiency, Mr. Jeffers was removed as principal. He was replaced by Ms. Harris-Frederick, who terrorized both the staff and the students. She was only there for one year and was then replaced by Ms. Mardy. \nMs. Mardy was very pleasant and brought on many welcomed changes and new programs. I was excited to have my daughter finish her last few years at PS 289. However, my excitement has turned into disappointment and frustration. There are several out of control students that are allowed to get away with things. Their bad behavior is rewarded, while other students are ignored. \nI had an issue an was directed to speak with the Parent Coordinator, Ms. Tyrell. She was completely useless and behaved as if I was bothering her. I was actually surprised that she was employed by tge school because I used to see her standing by the exit after school. I thought that she was a grand parent because she did not behave like a school employee at dismissal. \nThe guidance counselor, Ms Danny, is also useless. She did not offer assistance to parents with the middle school process and was very condescending when I asked about the that weren't on the District 17 application. \nI also don’t understand how the city has two elderly women as the school agents. One agent is very rude and always on her phone and the other appears to be confused all the time. \nMs. Mardy's attitude has also changed. She used to stand outside after school and was very welcoming. The assistant principal is completely unreachable, the parent coordinator and guidance counselor are useless and now Ms. Mardy shuns parents. \nMy daughter's teachers have been okay. The third and fourth grade teachers were excellent. My only issue with her current teacher is the management of a few wild students. \nYes, the computer programs, steel pan and other activities are great. However, the staff members need great improvement."", 'A follow up to my above review. \nFirst, the positives. Ms. Mardy is now back standing outside at dismissal. I\'ve seen her talking to parents again, but it doesn\'t appear genuine. The school also had intense test prep and my child felt very confident taking the state exams. Also, any time that I call the school I am greeted very well and the conversations are very pleasant. There are about five or six different voices that answer the phone. I wish those pleasantries extended to the front door and the administration. \nNow, on to my continued frustration. Many fifth grade parents are very upset. We were charged $130 for senior dues and our children were told that there isn\'t a prom and the senior trip is going to be a picnic in Staten Island. The school has also been hustling our children every day for money with sales at lunch. What are  they doing with our money? It is almost impossible to reach the assistant principal to find out what is going on. \nA parent informed us that she came up to the school to get some information. As she walked through the door, she saw a gray hair lady dragging and screaming at a student while the school safety sat there running her mouth. When the woman was shown to other parents, we were appalled to find out that the school had hired a known scammer from the neighborhood. She is also one of the people in charge of the sales at lunch. Now we see where our money is going. I don\'t want my child involved in these lame ""senior"" activities, but I don\'t want her to feel left out. This school will not be getting another penny from my household! \nI was relieved when I found out that Ms. Danny wasn\'t there any more. However, she has returned and the school now has two guidance counselors. There are barely 300 students. Why are there two counselors? It\'s not like they are controlling the students\' behavior. \nYears ago, things were so different. The class sizes were much bigger but the teachers and administrators maintained order. I don\'t know why Mr. Jeffers isn\'t there any more, but I don\'t recall the community speaking so ill of the school. Parents are concerned about the lead in the water again as well. \nI am now fearful that the same out of control students will be attending the same middle school as my child. \nI hope that the parents can get together and have the assistant principal, the guidance counselors, the parent coordinator and the school safety removed. The parents association was always bragging about how great the staff and Ms. Mardy were and fooled the rest of the  parents.

17K399,"[""I  went to ps 399 and let me tell you that very few teachers if any are going to help your child if they are being bullied. I was bullied all through my elementary school years and teachers saw it. I had very few friends and instead of helping me ( I didn't speak much English and I didn't know how the other kids treated me was wrong because the teachers never said a thing so I didn't know how to ask for help) they either just kept quiet or acted antagonistically towards me. I remember when I was painting and a seniors pulled me aside to wash my hands because she somehow thought I painted an intricate design on my hands (I was wearing henna, it's part of Arab culture, needs time and professional to do it and not a 5 year old and needs hours to set). They kept taking me to the bathroom to wash my hands and the teacher just stuck her papers. The academics are less than impressive. This may have changed since I was there but we'd spend days if not weeks on one lesson. After school programs were the most time consuming and useless. I, as well as my younger siblings who attended that school, learned absolutely nothing and our state test scores barely changed despite the teachers constantly pushing the parents whose kids weren't in after school to go, regardless of how well they were already doing. Language is another thing that this school fails at. Instead of getting their own translators for students and parents who don't speak English, they decide that young children should do the translating and blame the child if the child does not know much of that language. I remember when a teacher pulled me out of class in the beginning of the day to go translate for an adult mother. This teacher expected a 6 year old to be a flawless translator. Keep in my mind that I was still learning English and the only Arabic I knew was the Arabic my parents used for me ( and parents are usually going to talk about dinner or when we're going outside. They're not going to be explaining how the enrollment process works or the different needs of a child. ). When I told the teacher I couldn't understand much of what the parent was saying, she took me back to class and at the end of the day when my father came to pick me up, she stopped us and told my father I needed to learn more Arabic and to take me back for a vacation to our home country because it was important for me to do this. It was apparently my job to function as a translator despite me trying to learn both English and more Arabic. I have not even gone into areas like club and activities. The teachers do absolutely nothing to engage with students and make the clubs seem more than just a chore. the teachers apparently force the students into clubs and the students have to say outright that they don't want to be in any clubs. I was forced into violent club and stayed there for years until I realized I could quit. Everyday was mind-numingly boring and exhausting and the teachers did nothing to make this seem like fun. Later, after I made one drawing, I was suddenly in a comic making club without asking for my permission or informing my parents (who were outside for an hour waiting for me until I told the teacher an excuse that I couldn't be in this club because I had too much to do and didn't want to go on stage, which was part of the club). After that, a teacher told me I had to be in a club if I wanted it took look good on my resumé. But, instead, I passed everyone else in academics in my middle school and most of that was because after I quit those clubs, I wasn't tired and exhausted so I had more time to do my homework and not count the time until bed time. All in all, I advise against sending a child to this school. This school made me hate learning and it wasn't until I left  that I actually started to enjoy learning and school. it wasn't just me that felt this way about this school. My younger brothers and cousins also hated this school and recieved treatment similar to me. I don't want my child to be introduced to their first years of learning by going to a school like this that doesn't even bother to try.  It may have gotten into shape since I was a student her but from what I've seen of just their academics, they have gotten worse in that area. I wouldn't test out the other areas by sending my child there. There are much better elementary schools in New York and this is not even in the top 10, at least in my opinion. Have a good day."", ""School has a long way to go.  Violence outside of the school on a regular basis.

Before either of my child was accepted they needed to submit their school records including NYS ELA & Math Scores, report cards, attendance record, letter of recommendation and then they were required to take a school test in English and Mathematics.

Thank you', 'On at least four occasions this year, when her teacher was out and a sub couldn\'t be found, my fourth-grade daughter was placed in a random 2nd or pre-K class and told to read a book or play with an iPad in the back of the room all day.  Speaking of iPads, I\'m also concerned with how much YouTube she is indiscriminantly exposed to at this school.  There seems to be times when the students are given free rein with the SmartBoard and/or iPads, and while I\'m not trying to shield my daughter from things like the ""Bad Lip Reading Trump Inauguration"", ""It\'s Raining Tacos"", or even some of the more misogynistic-sounding pop songs she hears in school, I\'m certain there are better uses of class time.', 'Our child just finished pre-k at PS 705 and we had a wonderful year. Her teacher was experienced, warm and highly skilled. He went above and beyond with monthly weekend trips for students and their families, extended time for parent/teacher conferences, weekly email updates, and was responsive to parental feedback and requests. The class also had a full time assistant teacher who was experienced, warm and competent. Our child grew a tremendous amount academically with a focus on phonics in particular, but also made close friends and thrived in social and emotional growth. \n\nBeyond the classroom, we were happy to find a diverse and active PTA and a principal who has regular time with parents and seems receptive to feedback. The parent coordinator, Kibibi, does an outstanding job. \n\nWe are happily starting our child in kindergarten this year. Our only concerns so far is some amount of turnover in teaching staff between the two years, but it is too early to know if that is a trend or concern. We also are happy to see the school focused on preserving diversity, and hope 705 can maintain this.  \n\nWhen you drop off kids at 705 in the morning you will see a group of kids running happily towards a door that is held open by a familiar and smiling face. The littlest students are met by an adult who takes them by the hand and leads them to their class. We are so happy to be part of this community and hope for many years as part of the 705 family.', 'I think it should be better option for the students to enjoy their education with Brooklyn arts and science elementary school.

As a first time participant in the NYC public school system I was amazed at how involved the parent community is in the school. I have witnessed a really positive, healthy camaraderie with the administration as parents and the school staff strive to achieve the same goals. \n\n\nKelly\'s comments about the school being a ""start-up"" are right on. A start-up in the best sense of the term. I have a three year old who will be starting Pre-K here in another year, and I\'m excited about all that we can accomplish at this fantastic school. Yes, it truly is a diverse community. The school administration is keenly aware of the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood that it finds itself in, and is continually working to make sure that this is a school for all of the children and families in Crown Heights, and not just those who recently arrived. Kibibi Oyo, the parent teacher coordinator has lived in the neighborhood for a long time, and she has proven to be a responsive, thorough and friendly face of the school for day to day interactions with families.  \n\n\nPrincipal Soto cares deeply about all of her children at the school, and is very accessible. She really is a remarkable leader. We\'ve joined her for her frequent open breakfast meetings at the school, and it\'s been satisfying seeing her achieve her stated goals for the school over the course of the year. She\'s transparent when things don\'t work out exactly as planned, and remains flexible about the ways the school can provide the best for the kids of 705.', 'Simply put, this a great school. The principal is awesome, the teachers are super. We attended Pre-k and loved Miss Sosa. We gave our daughter the option to choose to stay at 705 or go to PS38, because we were torn, as was she. We went to PS38 and are very happy there too. Our kid liked the colors of the school walls and the library with bean bag chairs and the fact that a drumming class was going on when we visited 38. Sometimes, fate rests on weird choices like that. My life is full of ""bean bag"" choices, and I\'m still standing.\n\nI echo what Kelly said about convenience of a school. Where we are now is equal distant from our house, but in a different direction. If it were any farther, we\'d be super bummed. You have to remember that you\'re going to go to this location a couple hundred times a year - round trip! Don\'t take that decision lightly. We know people who killed themselves to get into their first choice, stalking the principal and all, but now they\'re dying from the commute. Eventually they\'ll probably do the school bus, but their kid will be on the bus an hour each way. Since this is elementary school, I think it\'s enormously helpful to family life to stay within a reasonable commute. If you don\'t hear that comment from anyone else, I\'m glad you just read it! It\'s super important. I get to spend more time with my darling daughters as a result.\n\nGive 705 a tour. Check in with the PTA and principal. I suspect you\'ll immediately feel this could be a great option for you kid.', 'This is my second comment on this page. My first was when my son was in Pre-K at 705. He is now a proud 705 first grader, so it\'s high time for an update. Apologies in advance for its length. I\'m still marveling at our good fortune in finding this school and being a part of its formative years. There hasn\'t been a single day when he hasn\'t sprinted out the door to school. He\'s a flexible kid, but he\'s also discerning -- he knows how to recognize a good thing. At 705, he is learning, and he is loved. He\'s had two truly excellent teachers in three years; one seasoned, one new but very capable. Reading and math are clicking into place, the Spanish is sinking in, he\'s come home spouting scientific facts, he regales me with stories about the lives of composers. Etc.\n\nYes, we have lost some families. The NYC public school system encourages shopping and trading up, and who can fault people for questing for the perfect fit, especially in a time when we channel so much anxious energy into our parenting? 705 is still a startup, with rough edges that are not to everyone\'s taste. Some wonderful families that attended for a while and moved on did not live within walking distance of the school, which is something that, for us, seals the deal. Plus, many people are afraid (mistakenly, I believe) of junior high in D17, and so seek seats elsewhere.\n\nBut believe it or not, almost half of his original Pre-K class is still in the same classroom together this year (with others in another first-grade class), along with many of the great kids who joined up last year in Kindergarten (and some of those kids in another first-grade class, as well). And he\'s meeting lovely new kids all the time. He\'s in a bridge class this year, first and second graders together, designed to aggregate native Spanish speakers in a way that will best serve the needs of all kids. It\'s an innovative way to do things. That\'s how Principal Soto rolls. She experiments, she calibrates, she\'s always thinking. \n\nYes, the kids do worksheets. But they also do art projects, sing songs, play instruments, take dance and gym class, read lots of books, and, believe it or not, get assessed on things like empathy and impulse control, aka ""habits of mind"" (http://www.edutopia.org/blog/habits-of-mind-terrell-heick). Not in any way that will ""go down on your permanent record,"" (to quote the Violent Femmes, because ... why not) but in a way that\'s supremely helpful to parents who value emotional intelligence and Paul Tough-style ""grit"" and want to understand what their kids really excel at and struggle with, day to day, as they learn how to learn, and how to get along with other people.\n\nMelissa\'s comment below touched me deeply. She nailed it, I think. I did not attend Brooklyn public schools, so I have been getting my own education the past 2.5 years. It has been the most eye-opening, challenging, rewarding experience of my life, seeing my neighborhood and my neighbors and the future of our city from this angle, stepping outside myself to get to know people who are very different from me, and pitching in to help build something.\n\nI don\'t fault anyone new to the system for having unrealistic expectations of what a public school can provide. (It is outrageous, outrageous, that basically every single ""extra"" in the most popular NYC public schools among upper-middle-class parents—including extra teaching hands in our too-crowded classrooms—is paid for out of pocket by those same upper-middle-class parents. We all should be really pissed off about that.) But to her point, real diversity is not always comfortable. Real diversity means a wide spectrum of beliefs in practice at the same time. Real diversity means that the school needs to stretch to accommodate many different kinds of needs. How would you run a school with both students who attended high-priced private preschool and students who live in homeless shelters? How would you apportion your resources, your time? And what would you hope that those kids take away from their time spent with one another? \n\nIn the end, I honestly believe my son (and my daughter, for whom the first day of 705 Pre-K can\'t come fast enough) could build critical thinking skills and learn to read and appreciate literature and get the building blocks of math and science and learn about the wider world (as much as you can really learn about the wider world without experiencing it firsthand) at many schools. Only here can they walk a few blocks, and walk into a loving community of teachers and classmates that actively seeks to reflect, understand, and learn from the fascinating environment immediately surrounding it. \n\nOh and a quick shout-out to our new parent coordinator, Kibibi Oyo, who is a longtime neighborhood resident and who has done a wonderful job in a few short months of meeting ALL our needs, communicating clearly to all, and bringing us together. I\'m really impressed. Ditto our PTA leadership in co-presidents Michael Sclafani and Amina DeLeon. They make a good team. Thanks, guys.', 'My son is at PS 705 and we are really pleased with what we are seeing happening at this school. First and foremost, my son is in first grade and is reading, doing arithmetic, evolving his vocabulary and showing a more mature understanding of personal dynamics, history, geography and more. His teacher is Mrs Jones and she is a seasoned instructor with a firm, kind approach to learning. There is a para in the class - Mr Nelson - who lends a nice and needed male presence in a room filled with lots of energetic boys.\n\nI have seen comments about the PTA being disorganized and Ms Soto\'s ""vision"" not coming to life and I feel quite the opposite. Anyone who has been a part of anything entrepreneurial or new knows that growth is a process and takes time. In the beginning of its third year, this school has committed to its direction and is doing a great job staying on course. Stumbling blocks, certainly, but passion and commitment? No doubt! \n\nIf I were to share a complaint it would be more about the parents than anything else. I have led prospective parent tours, and I hear lots of questions from parents that are quite frankly unrealistic. I believe that there are families looking at this school that have little to no understanding of what the public school system in NYC is all about. \n\nI think one of the reasons why parents are taking their kids out of the school is due to their misunderstanding of what diversity might look like, as well as their own inability to get involved - be a part of the solution not the problem. We talk about wanting a neighborhood school reflective of the community - Crown Heights - but many parents ultimately want something different that they are unwilling to admit. I am a product of Brooklyn public schools in the 70s so I believe I have a pretty realistic sense of what diversity looks like. \n\nMy family made the choice to move to District 17 and we are happy that there is a nurturing, educational environment in our district that is delivering care and instruction to kids from the area. If you too are living in the zone or even in the district and want to be a part of a community where your voice is heard, where the principal knows your name, where kids are learning from others, then this school is for you.', ""PS 705 is our zoned school.  I really wanted to love this school due to the proximity from our home.  Our commute could definitely not be easier.  I heard mixed reviews from past parents but wanted to give it a chance for my Pre-K child.  This school has been given a lot of praise for a District 17 school but really it comes down to there not being a better option in the district and the past PTA President being really great with PR.  The parents want to love the school and want you to love it but I often feel that they are still trying to convince themselves that it really is a good school. The PTA meetings have low attendance, are disorganized, and are incredibly unproductive.  Principal Soto is a great visionary but not so great with the execution.  And the execution of the amazing plan is what really counts.  The school was sold to everyone as a school that offered dual language throughout all of the grades.  This year they decided to do away with the dual language program at the Pre-K level due to not being able to recruit enough Spanish speakers.  This of course was not told to parents until school assignments were already out. They should not sell parents on something that they aren’t going to offer. Communication at this school is very poor.  They do not keep their website current and the front office staff are useless. The parent coordinator is enthusiastic and another visionary but again, not so great at the execution.  The\nschool is a lot of talk about being “progressive” but it’s really not even as\nprogressive as the public school that I went to 20 years ago.  If anything, they are far behind.  Principal Soto seems to employ very green teachers with not a lot of class management skills.  Principal Soto talks about their amazing gym teacher but not all Pre-K students event have gym class.  The school seems to really be most fond of the children that “shut up and listen” versus the children that think outside\nof the box and ask a lot of questions. If your child has any character or creativity and is in any way stubborn then this is not the school for you. Creativity is not well received regardless of what the principal tells you.  The teachers merely do what is\nrequired of them and rarely do anything above and beyond.  They set the bar low so that children meet their expectations versus raising the bar and having children rise to the occasion.  If you simply want your child to just do worksheet after worksheet instead of making lessons interesting then you have found a great fit.  The lessons are not inspiring and the art projects lack creativity.  Many parents leave the school as soon as they have a better opportunity for their child.  I read through the list of comments below prior to adding my own.  I saw that several of the parents with the praising reviews have already left the school for better schools in a different district.  I have spoken to several of them personally and they said that they did not realize how much the school was lacking until they left.  It is merely an adequate school.  Your child more than likely will not be inspired to learn or enjoy school. If you have a chance to send your child to a school out of District 17 then definitely do so.  Pre-K here is pretty much free daycare.  And when your child hits 1st grade and education really matters they are really not going to be getting what they need.  You will be disappointed and will more than likely need to hire a tutor just to keep your child where they need to be.  If this is your only option, fine.  But if you have another option then take it  This school may be great in 10-15 years but don't waste your child's important elementary years with a school that is severely lacking.

17K770,"['Even when the world stopped, Kindergarten at PS 770 took a pause then shifted to zoom with socking ease. Watching the teachers and administration adapt to the new online learning platform has only highlight how much care and pride they take in teaching our little ones. These teachers welcome us into their homes every morning, and even with children of there own in just off to the side, and they are still as engaging and positive spirited as when we were physically together. A silver lining of the COVID 19 Pandemic is that I can see in real-time how wonderful they are. ( I have no idea where they muster the patience or humor to manage a thirty 5 year olds on a daily zoom call.) They have adapted so well in these unprecedented times that my family only encouraged heading into whatever NYC public schools will look link in Fall 2020.', 'We love the style of teaching because it allows all of the teachers to have a sense of what the child needs and what works best for them. They play to each others strengths and allow the large classes to be broken into smaller groups that are based on ability so no child is in an area that they might fall behind in. I think it allows the students to learn to be flexible with their learning because they can get used to different teaching styles/personalities. And the teachers loop with the students so there is no adjustment period in the beginning of the school year. We love the HEARTS curriculum and has helped teach social emotional learning to our child. \nPost COVID-Ms Saratovsky was very prepared for the schools shut down and sent out a ton of materials to allow the students to keep learning. The teachers are so dedicated and working so hard through online learning, very open to feedback and seem to really miss their students and are genuinely happy to see them even through a screen. \u2028PS 770 has live teaching with new lessons everyday and the teachers are also available for extra help if needed at the end of the day.', ""I am a current parent at PS770 with two kids enrolled, one in 4th grade and one in 1st. We have been at the school since my 4th grader was in pre-k. I have served on the PTA and been a class parent so I have seen the school through many different lenses. I am also a public school DOE teacher and have the opportunity to see lots of other schools and how they do things. I can say, without hesitation, that 770 is a superb school. \n\nBefore the current situation of remote learning we were thrilled with the teaching staff and the principal, Jessica Saratovsky. They have such passion for the students and really engage our children in learning. The content and rigor of the lessons is of a high quality. I am constantly impressed by the projects they are working on. \n\nSince we have been in remote learning due to Covid 19 the quality of the teaching and the passion for education has shone through. Our teachers were ready that first Monday with live teaching and lessons that were appropriate for the students' needs taking into consideration the stress of the situation, various family needs and technology issues. They have continued to show up for our kids each day as this has progressed. It has been a source of comfort and stability in a time of uncertainty for our kids. They continue to introduce new content, but in ways that are manageable, both for the parents at home and the students. While in person teaching is the best way, they have truly embraced remote learning. I cannot say enough about how appreciative and impressed we have been with the continued high quality of teaching."", 'We have one daughter in 1st grade and a second who will be entering PreK in the fall, and have been parents here since our oldest was in PreK. We are a family with lots of choice in where we could send our children. We continue to choose P.S. 770 over other options because <b>the school attracts top educators interested in pursuing a unique approach to teaching</b>. This approach focuses on building relationships with the children, then staying with them (""looping"" that has been mentioned). This means that in September they can hit the ground running versus spending weeks getting to know where the child is academically and socially. [Note that unlike what is reported in the description, the looping doesn\'t happen from K-5 but K-2 and 3-5]. The benefit of the ""teaching team"" structure is that the teachers can provide different levels of academic instruction: the grade is housed in one large class, but is broken up into ""houses"" that are fluid and rotate for core subjects like math, reading, and spelling (fundations). My oldest is learning how to be a better citizen, a more caring person through attention to relationships and social activism. But she\'s also preparing and will be ready for admission to a top middle school. <b>Academics are not sacrificed for the social-emotional work that\'s being done in the classroom. </b>\n\nFinally,<b> the open door policy and no homework policy have been big draws for us</b>. I didn\'t realize until we were already at P.S. 770 that many schools don\'t let parents into the classroom without express advance permission. At P.S. 770 you can come anytime, no questions asked. You can go into your own child\'s classroom, or go visit another. You can stay 10 minutes or all day. This is a great way to understand what\'s happening with your child in the classroom, and can answer many questions for you first-hand. The instructors are available to you offline, as well, and the focus on relationship-building extends to the parent community, too. And Principal Saratovsky also makes herself available above and beyond what could normally be expected of a principal.\n\nAnd, although the no-homework policy can be quite controversial, the ""homework"" as we normally would see it is actually being done in the class. Except in PreK which is play-based learning, the children hear a lesson, then work the problem individually or in small groups in the moment. <b>There is always opportunity, should a parent want it, to use the provided bonus homework problems sent home each work. </b>They aren\'t officially graded, but the teachers are fierce advocates for your child and I have no doubt would be happy to go over the work if asked. \n\nIn summary: we are there for the ""special sauce"" that happens in the classroom. That sauce is a mix of strong academic instruction and focus on social-emotional learning (aka relationship building).', ""This school is a spectacular, special find for Brooklyn parents. We are so glad that we chose this school for our son. The teaching model, which utilizes a team of teachers for each grade, ensures that students receive a variety of teaching styles, and a true community of support for the students' learning. Teachers work together to create a cohesive curriculum, which each teacher specializing in one area-- the result is a dynamic classroom that always keeps students engaged. Hands on learning is truly an integral part of this school-- as well as wonderful arts education teachers for dance, music, and visual arts. The student-to-teacher ratios is unparalleled for a public school, and the teachers are accessible, kind, and exceptionally dedicated. \nThe classrooms are very spacious with high ceilings, a lot of light-- and are separated into different areas for each teacher. This allows students to move around from lesson to lesson and not be confined to one small room. Exactly what young learners need. \n\nOf course, now we are not in the classroom but at home. During this particularly challenging time with the COVID-19 quarantine, we have really been blown away by how fantastic the distance-learning set up has been. We've heard form other parents about teachers at other schools meeting the kids just once a day and then giving homework to do-- but the model that PS 770 has come up with is so much more effective. Students meet for short, subject-specific meetings with the different teachers on the teaching team. this ensures that our 1st grader is never bored-- and also never overwhelmed. They have created the perfect balance and it has been a life saver. It is just a testament to how competent and fabulous the teaching teams are at PS 770. \n\nWe are so grateful for them-- and would highly recommend this school to all Brooklyn parents-- you won't find anything like it!"", ""In this time of COVID 19, I wanted to come back here to share our experience of the school's efforts. I truly believe PS 770 to be an example for how to continue education remotely. When schools were closed, the administration and faculty took three days to convene and plan how to keep teaching. Principal Saratovsky has long done an excellent job of applying for grants, and as such the school was prepared and was able to distribute over 100 devices to children who had none. By the following Monday, they were up online with a full schedule including live teacher delivery, including their music, dance, and gym classes. They also record the lessons so that students could catch up when it best fit their family's schedule. \n\nTeachers have been very communicative about trying to find out how the change has worked for students, and have made adjustments. My two girls understand what is expected of them and are able to complete most everything asked. In some ways they even prefer aspects of this school day as they don't have to wake up as early or commute to school, though they miss being able to see their friends in person. The quality of teaching hasn't fallen off at all, despite having to learn to move content online with no notice, and then having to adjust from Zoom classrooms to Google Meet over a weekend. \n\nIn a moment where we aren't sure what school will look like for the foreseeable future, I feel very fortunate that my kids are in a place that has handled this crisis so well, and I wanted to come here to commend their efforts."", ""This is an exceptional school. My son is in pre-k. He loves it.  We just got our kindergarten acceptance and we couldn't be more excited to stay through fifth grade.  Academically, my son is learning a lot - obvious progress in reading, writing, and math, and also delving into more complex science, social studies, and interdisciplinary topics. His class did a unit on light, and he came home talking about different artificial and natural sources; on another day they used scales, and he came home excited to explain that a smaller number of heavy things can weigh more than a greater number of lighter things. It's something new every day. And much of what he learns is related to becoming a responsible citizen and community member. Complex concepts of racial, social and environmental justice have been introduced in ways he's capable of understanding and asking more and more sophisticated questions about. The school provides a ton of enrichment as well, with full time phys ed, music and dance teachers (and dedicated space in the building for each), and an art residency program. The pre-k has access to its own rooftop playground right from their classrooms, and they're outside once or twice a day. It's a small school. Everyone in the building - teachers, administrators, and even many parents - know all the children, providing an incredibly warm environment. \n\nThe social-emotional learning has also been a real highlight. The school uses HEARTS values, with each letter standing for a different positive social/emotional value (humility, empowerment, responsibility etc). Within a couple of months, he'd so internalized these values that even at home, if he's picking on his little sister or refusing to clean up his toys, I can ask what HEARTS value he's demonstrating, and he'll often apologize and change his behavior. He's four, and of course it doesn't always work, but it's obvious he understands and embraces the positive values he's learning.\n\nIt's been a great experience for us as parents as well. Our son's teachers are always accessible. The classrooms are open, with parents welcome and encouraged to to visit. Every six weeks or so, there's a formal opportunity for all parents to come see what their kids have been working on, which is also a great chance to get to know his teachers, get a real feel for how the classroom operates, and meet other students and families. \n\nMs. Saratovsky, the principal, is also unusually accessible and willing to discuss or explain anything, any time. She's at the door at drop off and pick up every day, holds regular parent forums, and hands out her email to parents the first time she meets them. She is constantly working to address parent concerns and improve kids' experience, from the smallest things (dedicating a space for kids to leave their scooters, so they can ride to school) to the biggest (reducing the number of required assignments for pre-k students during the COVID-19 distance learning after seeing some families struggle). Ms. Saratovsky can and will explain the careful consideration that has gone into everything, from the school's homework policy, to its uniform policy, which carefully accommodate expectations of and burdens on families without sacrificing educational goals for children. If you're wondering what the school's policy is about something, or why it isn't something else, ask her! She'll discuss it with you. You may not ultimately agree, but you'll come away convinced that your concerns have been thoughtfully and expertly weighed. \n\nRecently, we've been blown away by the school's response to COVID-19, and everything the administration has done to facilitate learning and provide usable, engaging materials, including hours of live teaching.

She doesn't dictate behavior to students, instead educating them to make informed and kind decisions - as when she had some of the school's older students think through and prepare presentations for each other on why they had or had not chosen to kneel for the pledge at the school's morning meeting, or when she had students who had used bullying words toward their friends look up the words' meanings and discuss whether and why they had or had not used them appropriately.  The same approach is used by teachers, even in the pre-k classroom, where students are taught and encouraged to examine their own behavior and solve problems they and others create.

The school continues to improve and evolve the teaching methods and connecting with students and families.', 'I have so many positive things to say about PS 770, it\'s difficult to decide where to start! My profession as an informal educator has provided me with significant exposure to Brooklyn\'s public schools, so it was easy to recognize from early interactions how special PS 770 is compared to other options in our borough. In 7 years of teaching in NYC, I have never come across a principal as communicative as Jessica Saratovsky and this commitment to communication is pervasive throughout the entire school. This school really goes out of its way to provide ample opportunities for parents to converse with staff (digitally/in-person, during the day/evenings), which illustrates not only its commitment to its students and their families, but an intrinsic understanding of parents\' different scheduling and communication needs. Case in point, school tours for prospective families are offered in the evenings as well as during the school day. \n\nOthers have mentioned the diversity of the school\'s student population, but what\'s just as important is the school\'s dedication to culturally relevant/responsive pedagogy and critically conscious teaching practices. It\'s not enough to have students attend a ""diverse"" school; they need to see this diversity represented in their instruction. The message that whiteness needs to be de-centered is being communicated in an impactful way at PS 770. In our one year at the school (our child is in Kindergarten), teachers have participated in mandatory anti-biased training, Ms. Saratovsky has openly shared her participation in decolonizing education cohort, a number of parents have joined a six month antiracism training and the PTA offered a free undoing racism workshop for the entire parent community. \n\nAnd now, we\'re in the midst of Covid-19. PS 770 has gone out of the way to get technology into the hands of the students who need it most. Staff sacrificed their own health to make a trip back to the school after it closed to collect and deliver laptops to students that needed them after the DOE\'s promise to provide these devices failed to materialize in the promised timespan. During this exceptionally challenging and emotionally and physically taxing time, our teachers are offering live instruction from roughly 9am-2pm every school day. In speaking with a handful of friends with kids at other schools it seems none are doing as much as PS 770 and I mean this as an absolute compliment. The community understands the suffering a lot of our families are going through and the communication has been as clear as ever that the intention is to do as much as each family feels is right for them. Our kids have different needs, learning styles and attention spans, but despite this the teachers have excelled at making my family at least feel exceptionally supported - they\'ve truly offered a bit of respite, consistency and happiness in this troubling time and we\'re so so so thankful and proud to be a part of the PS 770 community now more than ever.', ""We have two daughters who have been attending PS770 since Pre-K and are currently heading into 4th and 2nd grades. We love the school for many reasons. Unlike the vast majority of schools in the city, 770 is actually a diverse school. Students come from across District 17 and several other surrounding areas, and they reflect the broad range of neighborhoods in this district. Our daughters see it and live it each day and are learning the value of that diversity. When they attend various summer day camps or see other schools on the street they routinely complain if the groups are too homogenous because it feels artificial to them. That's invaluable to me. The school does a good job of trying to address notions of cultural identity and difference and how to reach across those divides, not only among the students, but among the parent body as well. It's not simple or easy, but for those reasons, much of the rest of the world isn't trying at all. It's helping to build a close knit community around the school. We have watched friends leave the school for G and T schools and then return quickly because they missed the 770 family atmosphere. The school is one of the few open campuses around. As a parent, you're always welcome to come observe a class or to plan with teachers to help teach a lesson.\n\nI've been extremely impressed with the school's work with social emotional development. Our girls have had some conflicts in personality with classmates over the years (as all kids do), and the teachers have taken time out to work with everyone involved to be able to identify what is happening between them and to help them come up with their own solutions. It's led to a level of emotional maturity that many adults could aspire to. I really can't say enough of the school's work here. \n\nPrevious comments mentioned the DOE's change to the school's teaching structure. It was very disappointing, as the master teacher system was really great for developing younger teachers and for pulling kids out within the class day for both enrichment and remediation. That's something we miss. That said, the teachers are true professionals and have continued to provide a quality education to the students, finding ways to challenge them at their own levels. They largely deliver content via project based learning, letting the kids drive much of the content, which helps them learn critical thinking strategies at each grade level. Our 3rd grader recently completed a segment on climate change and social activism that saw the class produce a 20 minute newscast as a culminating project. The kids broke into groups as anchors, meteorologists, field reporters, environmental scientists, advertising developers, and animators. They wrote scripts, staged, recorded and edited the movie. They employed green screen work and stop motion animation in addition to acting and doing all the set design. The teachers had a ton of work to do keeping all these groups on task, and the kids really pulled it off. It was a truly interdisciplinary unit from a bunch of 8 and 9 year olds.\n\nThings are generally improving incrementally each year as well. Since we started at the school 5 years ago we have added full-time gym, music, and dance teachers who have really enriched the school. The PTA has been fundraising to bring in supplemental visual art programming from Art Yard and Henry Street, and parents are working with teachers to find more ways to intertwine art within the curriculum. Parent involvement has also brought a small garden to the outdoor space at the school. The administration and parents have worked to form relationships with local politicians and in winning grants to fund various STEM initiatives and bring an impressive amount of technology to the school. There are more areas that could be strengthened as in most schools, but the trajectory within what is still a young school has been steadily upward, and parent input and help is generally welcomed."", ""I am lucky enough to be  a teacher and now a parent at 770. At this point it feels like an extension of my family. I couldn't be happier about the academic challenges, joy, and emotional support my child receives everyday at school. I had the option of sending my son to a coveted dual-language program close to home but after touring the school, I had nothing but affirmation that 770 goes above and beyond. I think my child would be academically successful in many different types of schools but I know that at 770 he is not only being academically stimulated. He is also being given the tools to collaborate, be kind, thoughtful, creative, think critically, AND give back to his community. The school really lives what it values."", 'Our two kids have been at PS770 since pre-K and are now in second grade. We love the school. It’s small enough that there’s an intimate, friendly vibe. We love the no-homework policy, and the sensible attitude toward standardized testing. We never feel the teachers are teaching to the test – indeed, the inquiry-based, integrated curriculum is really thoughtful. The principal is very receptive to input from parents. We appreciate the school’s “love and logic” philosophy, which translates into respect for every person in the building. Not that there’s never any screaming, but compared to most schools, it’s pretty serene.\n\nThe teachers’ pay cuts chronicled in the Daily News story were demoralizing, no doubt about that. But it really seems like PS770’s teachers and administration have been resilient and generally moved beyond the DOE’s decision. I’ve seen no evidence that the change has “ruin[ed] the school’s upbeat spirit,” as the Daily News story suggested. Far from it. I feel like this year is the best year we’ve experienced at the school. Among other things, there’s now a full-time music teacher, which the school hasn’t had in the time we’ve been there. The after-school program is now run by Trail Blazers, which has been an excellent addition—we love their focus on the environment and that the kids spend time outside every afternoon. And PS770 was recently selected to be a partner of the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, which will create an art gallery within the school and provide visual arts instruction to every student.\n\nSo are there any downsides? Some kids will find the open classroom overly stimulating; one of my sons falls into that category, and so he and his teacher come up with strategies to help him focus. Also, the air conditioning doesn’t really work, the restrooms are pretty antiquated, the auditorium needs an overhaul. But I’m convinced that the teachers at PS770 are among the very best in the city and that my kids are getting an excellent education in a vibrant, diverse, loving environment.', ""PS 770 master teachers lost as much as $50,000 in pay after the school ended a program which paid them to train less experienced colleagues in the school's progressive, open classroom model, the <a href=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/21-teachers-brooklyn-school-pay-cuts-50g-article-1.3517996?utm_source=Master+Mailing+List&utm_campaign=9f1ee7d193-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_25&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_23e3b96952-9f1ee7d193-75750697>New York Daily News reports</a>."", ""Our son is in kindergarten at PS 770, and we have been extremely happy with our choice to enroll him. I went on many tours of public schools in our district, and outside of it, considered charter schools, and did my share of fretting about the decision. I have yet to see a NYC public school with brighter or larger classrooms. The kids have space to spread out, explore, and work on their project-based play and learning. The classrooms are not at all chaotic, despite the number of little kids in them. I know other Brooklyn parents who are worried over the amount of homework their five year olds are bringing home with them. PS 770 is a no-homework school and has been on the forefront, since its inception, with incorporating the evidence-based findings that homework does not help students master skills or knowledge into its approach to curriculum and learning.\n\nWe love that our son has four teachers in his classroom with close knowledge of him as a person and a student; this teaching model is vibrant and productive, and I know that my son feels respected and cared for during the school day.\n\nThe school community is warm and active and is not shying away from the hard questions that attend public school in NYC: the principal hosts parent forums that find parents from all walks having engaging conversations with one another about parenting and education. The school is committed to maintaining the diversity (class, race, ethnicity) of its student population; a supported, diverse student population is good for *all* and more public schools should be working toward this goal as 770 is.\n\nIn all, PS 770's curriculum and structure exhibits some of the best research-supported approaches in education: no homework, an hour of daily exercise (rain, snow, or shine!), a diverse student population, project-based learning, and supporting and developing emotional intelligence in each student. The school is still new and growing; the PTA is continuing to develop and organize, but we love that we will have the opportunity to grow with the school."", 'Are there afterschool for PreK ?', 'Upcoming tours:\n10/27 10:00 AM\n11/2 5:30 PM\n11/9 10:00 AM\n11/16 5:30 PM\n11/22 10:00 AM\n11/30 5:30 PM\n12/7 10:00 AM\n12/13 5:30 PM', 'After a conversation this morning with a stressed mom at another school -- who was told that her kindergartener was ""too far behind"" and ""won\'t graduate from kindergarten"" because she wasn\'t up to par with the other kids -- I was moved to write this review of PS 770. Simply because we don\'t have these stresses. Instead of teachers who push the kids too hard at a young age, we have teachers who encourage and love our kids. I have a daughter in the 2nd grade and a son in pre-K, and we can\'t say enough about our school. The TNAA model encourages excitement for learning, to a level where both of our kids can\'t wait to go to school. The school is diverse and inclusive. They use their 6-week curriculum courses to pull in all areas of learning and keep everything more interesting for the students. The teachers are observant and really care about each student. Our daughter is ahead of the curve in a lot of areas, but has some hand-eye coordination problems with her writing, and her teachers went out of their way to find solutions to help her, even before we had her evaluated for her IEP. Never once did she feel as though she was lacking, or that she had to ""just try harder"" -- they keep her excitement for learning up, and she loves her IEP sessions when they happen. \n\nI spent the morning making this other mom feel better, trying to get her to understand that her daughter is normal and that she just learns differently, and crying with her as she asserted that she was trying her best and that she just feels so bad for her kid. The thing is, her daughter IS normal. She is only in kindergarten, and no one should be this stressed out in school at this age. And I realized that sometimes, I take our school for granted -- until I\'m faced with another parent\'s real concern over his/her kid\'s education. In the long run, I want my kids to be happy going to school and excited to learn, because it sets up the right mindset and skills for their educational future. And PS 770 answers all of that. I\'m so grateful for Ms. Saratovsky, the Bessie Coleman team, and everyone at our school for making it such a wonderful environment.', ""Our son has now completed almost a full year in PS 770, and we are very pleased with the school. He went to play-based preschool, so we were worried about kindergarten transition, and quite frankly did not agree with the whole idea of full-on academics being forced upon as young children as 5-year-old. We also did not like the idea of being slammed with daily homework that we did not see benefit with, but only a risk to the motivation of young students. We have been so happy with PS 770 being able to balance academics with other important aspects of students lives (social growth, creativity, individual attention..) We love the classroom setup (library, play corner etc), daily exercise and outdoor-time. School is open to parents and we feel involved and welcomed as we are often invited to classroom to observe/participate in student's projects. School is also diverse (and equal), which was also one of our hopes, taken that we live in a city where it is possible, but still not necessarily common. We were first worried about the behavioral charts (as another reviewer put it), but the way they were incorporated seemed to be beneficial, so our worries quickly disappeared. We are also excited that the teacher's will loop with our son and they can continue next fall where they left of (and his teachers have an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each student right away).

The classrooms are enormous, filled with natural light and I love that my child is being taught by a team of three teachers as well as having a full time staff helper. The 48 students are divided into three houses and my daughter had no trouble moving from the 6 family co-op pre-school/ playgroup we had her in for 4 years into this inspired version of education that is happening at PS770. The school encourages independence and rewards students for showing empathy and responsibility. My husband and I visited 9 schools before deciding on 770 and we love the progressive atmosphere among the teachers and parent community. \nIn terms of homework, I love that the practice packets are distributed on Fridays and are not mandatory. Our family\'s work schedule would make daily homework unfeasible!\nThe school is small, with one class per grade and the small staff recognizes my voice when I call. I didn\'t know that would be so important to me, but it is.
