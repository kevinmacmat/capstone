22K014,"['good morning', ""Dear Ms. Maffeo,\n\nThe experience was rich at Shellbank.  I have no complaints from the teachers who started working with Emanuel in the sixth grade.  They were awesome.  And to have two of them in the seventh was simply awesome.  While his final year was a challenge he rose to the occasion because Dr. Gill, Ms. Gonzales, and others were not having it.  Especially Ms. Gonazales who seem to understand much of Emanuel's needs.\n\nAt first I was so skeptical because of the distance and the location but I have found that some of the best teaching is areas where you least expected.  Well, enough of that.\n\nSummer Emanuel got into The Trio program which will mentor him throughout his high school years.  I am grateful because it takes some of the pressure off of me worrying about this journey.  However, I plan on being as active as I can to support.\n\nWell enough your summer and come back ready to begin a new school year with joy and excitement.  Our children need you.\n\nGlenn McMillan, DMA"", 'Shell Bank has come along way since I was a student there many years ago. When I attended the school, there were 1500 students enrolled.

The staff were friendly and accommodating not just to me as a prospective parent but to each other and that speaks volumes! Kids seem engaged with what appears to be long tenured staff. Recess time is quite subdued which is quite an anomaly.  It is not a modern school but the staff  appears collaborative and the school does try to incorporate various enrichment activities for the kids (outside of the typical once a week art and/or music); although not as much as other schools with higher parental involvement and stronger PTAs but there is a effort and that is important.']"

22K139,"['My son came home yesterday and told me that his lunch teacher blew a whistle at the class and he had to cover his ears because it was so loud. My older daughter backed up his story that the lunch teachers all blow whistles in the cafeteria. Why are grownups blowing whistles at little kids? And so close that they have to cover their ears? This is an elementary school, not an army or prison! Who approved this as how to treat  little kids? If this is ok with the administration I have second thoughts about sending my kids back next year.', ""My oldest son is about to start second grade and my youngest is about to start pre-K here.  We have been thrilled with my oldest's experience at this school.  Like another poster below we turned down a G+T spot in another district (they're thin on the ground in this district if you don't live further down in Midwood), and hoped the value of a neighborhood school and the commuting saved time would outweigh any weakness in the academic instruction.  We needn't have worried.  He has been challenged and interested since day 1, has become passionate about Chess, competing regularly in the national-class program run by Mr. West (expanding dramatically this year), and he's made great friends.  He's in the dual-language program and his teachers so far (Ms. Gioia and Ms. Colina) have been fantastic.   Principal McDonald was outside the school gates on our first day to greet each new student and has been a warm and responsive head ever since.  \n\nThis site gets a lot of traffic but not a lot of comments.  As you read down this list you quickly get to 5 year old complaints that don't have any bearing on the school we've experienced.  I understand the closing of the mini-schools was controversial at the time - and I imagine I might have been conflicted were we parents at the time.  As someone who's only seen the combined school however the result is a cohesive, diverse school that's a great reflection of and advert for the neighborhood."", ""My son is a Kindergartner in Ms. Zafra's dual language class.  In our school search last year we looked at multiple programs at charter, public and private schools across  several Brooklyn neighborhoods.  We chose PS 139 not only because we think it's important to invest our time and collaborative energy in our local zoned school but also because we found that the school environment and philosophy is aligned to what makes young learners thrive: a child focused environment that is both  progressive and collaborative.  When I went for a tour and a classroom observation at PS 139 back in Spring 2016, I found a welcoming atmosphere where children felt special and parents were engaged as partners in building a positive culture.  Every classroom that I saw that day and since our enrollment this past fall is characterized by collaborative learning and small group instruction.  Teachers are energetic and professional.  They do not prioritize standardized testing but they do use intentional assessment so that they can differentiate instruction.  Teachers meet kids where they are so that they can develop confidence and grow.  Since joining the School Leadership Team, I have learned that enrichment through purposeful play, arts, movement, and the sciences are a school-wide priority.  Teachers integrate play, inquiry and creative expression through the core subjects (Math and Literacy) and every class schedule features at least one enrichment activity taught by a specialist every day.  There is an active core of diverse parents who serve on various committees as leaders and key decision makers in conjunction with teachers, counselors and administrators.  Parents collaborate to drive in external resources through grants and donations as well as lead community events and celebrations.  3 months into kindergarten, my son has a big roster of friends who speak multiple languages and he is embracing the challenge to become bilingual himself.  This December, he is obsessed with the sequential story telling skills he is practicing in his Reader's Workshop.  He is also singing in Spanish and learning to solve problems with pictures and logic.  I was worried that his profound love of play and his curious nature wouldn't be nourished in a large classroom....that he would be lost.  So far, I find that he is flourishing.  His teacher is keenly aware of his strengths and challenge areas and is always willing to give me a summary or a quick anecdote at the end of the day.  We have about 15 minutes of homework each day.  Just enough for me to connect to what he is learning and help reinforce some good learning habits at home.  In addition to teaching children to read, write and speak in 2 languages, Ms. Zafra uses a progressive games based math program and makes sure that there is a purposeful play period that integrates hands on social studies and science exploration.  In summary, my son is having fun while learning in a caring environment.  I would recommend this school to every parent who wants their child to develop a strong sense of empathy, appreciation for diversity and a lifelong zest for learning."", ""This is my daughter's 4th year at ps 139 ( started in preK-she's in 2nd grade now.) We really like the school and the community.  She enjoys learning and going to school. We love the clubs and her teacher's every year have been great.  I have found the administration to be caring and helpful. When we had a issue last year the school and the assistant principal for her grade helped us navigate through it.  The school welcomes active parent involvement and the PA is great, and all the events, ranging from Harvest Fest to curriculum nights are always so fun! They emphasis physical activity and play with going outside everyday for a recess period, and every day of the week my daughter gets a different specialized class be it science, dance, music, or gym.  "", ""I am the parent of a student at PS 139, and I do not recognize the school in this review and in the comments.  We have had a very positive experience at PS 139.  We actually turned down a G&T spot at another district school in favor of PS 139, even though the mini-schools have been discontinued for incoming students.  \n\nThe school has a very strong community, and I appreciate that the principal is very present and attentive. I'm also pleased with my child's progress and I feel that he is being challenged. He LOVES school. He has joined the chess club and is in one of the many after-school programs on the campus.  As a working parent, I appreciate the excellent after-school options and the flexible schedule of PA meetings.  There are many opportunities and invitations to be involved in the classroom for parents who are able.\n\nPS 139 has had low test scores, as this review mentions. However, the school saw a huge improvement in 2015-2016, and I feel that things are moving in the right direction.  Academics receive a lot of focus in the classroom, but not at the expense of play, exercise, or field trips.  \n\nI am so grateful for this school community, and encourage other parents to tour PS 139 and talk to community members about their experiences with this outstanding school."", 'My daughter is a current student at 139.  I find it to be a warm, welcoming and diverse environment.   Her classroom teacher is fantastic. She\'s kind, progressive and places a strong value on play. The classroom is big and bright. It\'s filled with books, blocks, artwork and student writing. I\'ve been impressed by the approach to reading and writing. Students are encouraged to be ""brave"" readers and writers. They\'re taught to put themselves out there to try and spell a word and not worry if it doesn\'t look like adult spelling.  This approach works well for my daughter, who in the past has been hung up about making mistakes.  I also like that it acknowledges this type of learning can be difficult and scary for kids, and empowers them to be strong together.\n\nOutside the classroom, each week my daughter has science, dance, art, music and gym.  All children go outside for recess first and have lunch after.  Parents are encouraged to participate in classroom activities.  It\'s not yet December and there\'s already been three invitations to take neighborhood walks with the kids (for example to study trees, or look for geometry in the ""wild""), a visit to a firehouse and a field trip to a farm. Once a month, there\'s a Family Visit day, where parents may sit in on an hour of class or activity. There was a Thanksgiving show (kindergartners singing and dancing! The cuteness!) and a classroom feast for kids and families.\n\nDespite lousy reviews here, we were hopeful about sending our daughter to 139 based on the feedback of a few friends and a promising school tour.

Longtime principal Susan Shaeffer has announced she will retire, effective the end of February.\n\nFlynn seems to have been quite controversial at PS 193 and attracted criticism from some parents and teachers.

There has been a steep decline in the morale and atmosphere of this school in the past three years. Basic programs are removed by this principal and replaced with things such as dance and zumba. Why is dance given three times a week and science and language only given once a week? Another example of this principal\'s inability to work with parents is her refusal to take the needs of our children into consideration. Despite the protest from parents that they did not want departmentalization, the principal implemented it anyway. Parents are still furious over that unilateral decision.There is no transparency in any of her decisions regarding changes in the school. Her attitude is ""my way or the highway"", If we don\'t agree with the direction in which the school is going; both teachers and parents are expected to ""suck it up"". The current atmosphere at PS 193 has caused parents to take their children elsewhere; other parents are planning not to return in September. The environment is toxic at this and the principal perpetuates this by giving certain ""favorite"" parents access and priveleges within the school, while shutting other parents out. If the goal of the chancellor is ""parent engagement"" this principal is failing miserably and on those grounds, as well as many others, she is not a good fit for PS 193 and she must be removed.', 'FATHER ARRESTED AND INJURED AFTER CONFRONTING TEACHER ABOUT NOT LETTING YOUNG SON USE BATHROOM ""A Department of Education spokesperson said in a statement: ""We take this allegation seriously, and are investigating the matter"".  \n\nhttp://abc7ny.com/education/father-arrested-and-injured-after-confronting-teacher-about-not-letting-young-son-use-bathroom/1219555/\n\nI ask, shouldn\'t all allegations be investigated including the numerous against Administration?\n\n To be clear, I do not have a student at this school (hopefully I do not; come September).

It appears that the focus of the Administration is only on $$ (Budget) and # (Test scores), I mean why else is there very little enrichment, very few FT therapists, low number of school trips and allegedly kids that are mandated to stay in their seats all day. Is the thought that if they leave the class for 5 mins that they will miss vital test prep and cause lower test scores or does it cost the Administration money to let kids go the bathroom? ', 'Brooklyn Father Arrested After His Child Denied Bathroom At School Again!\nFebruary 24, 2016\n\nBaseball player Gil Hodges represented the best in Brooklyn, the best in Baseball, and was known to demonstrate the best characteristics on how to treat people, especially during that particularly tumultuous time in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the school bearing his name on Avenue L in Midwood, Brooklyn can no longer be associated with the same stunning attributes.\n\nOver the past three years, since Principal Tami Flynn was gifted the top job at the school by then Superintendent Rhonda D. Farkas, there has been a culture shift for the worse. The much loved and heralded school slogan of ""Be respectful Be Nice"" was removed and now many parents and children have documented instances of bullying, retaliation, and false charges and accusations all lead by the Principal Flynn. Many of the programs that made the school highly sought-after have been removed without explanation. The highly coveted Gifted and Talented program at the school is being taught by teachers that do not hold the required state license. Only two (2) out of the six (6) teachers in the program are currently licensed.\n\nWhile today began no differently at PS 193, it surely ended with a very clear picture. If parents ask questions, they will be arrested. Parent volunteer and school advocate to many, Vinny, was the target today (as he is most of the days). Yesterday, his 7 year-old second grader asked to go to the bathroom and was denied by staff although there is a directive on file that Vinny\'s son must be able to go to the bathroom. He was not permitted to do so yesterday, and soiled his clothing. This also happened earlier in the school year, where he had an emergency, was denied access to the bathroom, defecated on himself, and was forced to sit in it all school day long. His parents were not contacted, his clothes were not changed and were only made aware at dismissal when the child informed him of what transpired.\n\nFast forward to this morning. Vinny saw the teacher who denied his son access standing on the sidewalk escorting students off of the school bus as usual. Vinny approached the teacher and informed the male instructor that his son has a mandate that he can go to the bathroom at anytime. The Principal who was also on the sidewalk jumped in and began berating the parent. The parent walked away and went to work. At about 1PM this afternoon, the parent received a call from officers at the 70th Precinct who informed him that he needed to get to the school now. Vinny was nervous, but his gut instinct lead him to believe that something was not right. He left work, picked up his wife, and headed to the school.\n\nOnce there, he waited in the school vestibule with other parents and two other officers as it was nearing afternoon dismissal. An officer who was already in the school entered the vestibule directed Vinny to remove his hands from his pockets, asked if he had any weapons on his person, and then instructed Vinny to put his hands behind his back. The office proceeded to cuff Vinny and make him do the perp walk onto the sidewalk in front of his son\'s school.\n\nTo make matters worse, the police officers lead him into the patty wagon. With his cuffed hands behind his back, the officer nudged him into the van, where he fell and hit his head. He laid out on the sidewalk in front of the school until a parent called for EMS services.\n\nWhile parents stood on the sidewalk in complete and utter shock, the police yelled that parents would be arrested if they did not leave the school block or go across the street.\n\nParents have repeatedly reported the sick pattern of abuse of power at the school to the DOE, District 22 Superintendent\'s office, and anyone that would listen to no avail. Parents have long requested the Principal\'s removal.\n\nToday is Vinny\'s child\'s birthday.', 'So sad. This is my Alma Mater. I went to visit the school since my son will be attending Kindergarten in September and I have to say that the school seemed a bit rigid as did the Principal (yes I except elementary schools to be somewhat warm) and you really did see a bit of contention between long tenured staff and the Principal. Many of the teachers were new, very new and my specific questions were not answered specifically. Although, when a parent asked the Principal for specifics on the lack of enrichment, she answered specifically with talk of money and budget..not really what a prospective parent wants to hear. Come to think of it, all questions answered with $$ talk.', 'Destiny Esper is no longer the Parent Coordinator.  She left after the summer of 2015.  Her replacement is the former PA president who is friends with the principal.', 'http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/midwood-parents-call-for-removal-of-principal-1.11510286', 'The parent coordinator, Ms Esper left as well - after only 1 year and during the summer without notice to the parents.  As a continuation of a string of odd experiences at the school with no notice to the parents (or lying by the administration that notice had been sent and then trying to guilt the parents into thinking they just are not good enough parents by staying on top of things), the PA president became the parent coordinator.  Thankfully, she had enough common sense to resign from the presidency.  But, yes, the former strong G&T or ""CIG"" program has gone downhill with the 4th and 5th grade classes being combined for the first time this year.  Awful awful idea.  And again with NO prior notice to the parents - it was a big surprise in September for all of us.  All I can say is they would NEVER do that to special education students, so why to gifted students?  French is being phased out with the 4th and 5th grade G&T students being the last classes to receive it.  And Spanish (for all students) is being phased in this year.  The Robotics program is long dead and likely will never be resurrected.  The music program which we fought so hard for under Mr. Cimino has been systematically dismantled.

Pros: Most of the teachers have been very good, my child is having trouble with math and the teacher this year has been very good about helping me help my child.  I like that the counselors follow the kids through their entire time at school - the class has had the same counselor since 6th grade and they\'ve formed a good bond.

Initially they said they try to keep all the kids together throughout middle school, but for 7th grade my kid was moved to a different class, and then he was moved again for 8th grade back to his 6th grade class. We never figured out why. We were told that my child was in an honors class, but at this point I suspect that they just tell every parent that their kid is in the ""honors"" class. My kid has a very strong interest in visual art and had absolutely no opportunity whatsoever to take a visual art class. We\'re trying to get into an art-heavy high school but are now at a serious disadvantage. There have been some enrichment classes of little value - like digital citizenship and some kind of ""invention"" based career readiness course and another computer course that initially sound good but somehow devolved into them watching a bunch of movies by the end of the semester. After-school activities are somewhat limited. Since I work I have very little time to get involved with the PTA - meetings seem to be held during the day.

He helps to maintain order and respect amongst the students as best as he can and encourage the teachers to emulate likewise.  He helps to maintain order and respect amongst the students as best as he can and encourages the teachers to emulate likewise. Student behavior there is mediocre.   Most of the students are cooperative and comply with directions.  There are students that give minor resistance but it’s not to the point where it is outrageous and uncontrollable. Behavior can be managed. I’ve visited schools where the students fight brutally and use obscenities towards teachers.\n I’m hoping to see uniforms implemented throughout the building though. I had an opportunity to work with a very intelligent and collaborative ELA teacher named Mr. Engle.  He is extremely patient with the students and they respond well towards him. Although the teachers are very new, they remain very dedicated and do their utmost to foster academic performance.  For a new school I’m pretty satisfied with it and hope to return for another semester of student teaching.']"

The workload is a lot, but well worth it when hardworking and motivated students earn admission to private and top public high schools(including specialized high schools: Bronx HS of Science, Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, Brooklyn Latin).

I.S. 392 is a small school with a\ncouple hundred students that shares 2 floors of the clean and vibrant school\nbuilding with an elementary school (***kudos to the janitorial staff***).  The school administration and staff are dedicated and nurturing with strong and supportive leadership from the school’s principal Ms. Joseph.  \n\nThe academic standards and uniform policies are highly enforced; academics can be closely monitored by parents through an online resource (pupilpath.skedula.com) that is frequently updated with grades (classwork, homework, project, quiz, test) and frequent communications from the school administration and teachers.

My child;s class has 28 kids, but is doing well b/c I go over his homework and  make sure he is reading,. Like with any school, the parent must be involved, advocate and have good communication with the teachers and administration. Any issue that is deemed unacceptable  by you as a parent should be in writing and not just complaining to other parents. (That does nothing,) That way they know the problem is serious and there is a paper trail.  They will still try to give excuses but it is important to get a solution to the problem.  Follow up and have good communication with your child and find out if there were changes made. If not, call district and voice your concerns and find out what is supposed to be the proper procedures.\nMy problems was the teacher was absent and the subs did not teach proper lessons for approx. a month. My issue was that my child was not taught any lessons NOT the quality of the sub.( The school have a common core curriculum, so just get the proper folder and ask the same grade teachers what lesson they are up to and give a review and continue the lesson.Also ask the kids, they know where they were in a lesson, they are smart enough, So there is no excuse as to the subs had no lessons or the teacher left no lesson) Soto just kept focusing on the quality of the subs even though I repeatedly told her that wasn\'t the issue, it was no lessons were taught.  \n What upset me is that the asst. principals and principal ""didnot know"" the children weren\'t taught any lessons??and kept trying to deflect the issue. It\'s their jobs and responsibilities...( PLEASE parents aren\'t stupid)  but when I called district, I found out that the school administrators (principal, AP) are to monitor the sub and if they cannot teach a lesson, administration is supposed to help them. So the school can ask District  to get guidance, if ""they didn\'t know."" (Same problems and excuses, just different principal) \n\n\nMy suggestion is be involved in your child\'s learning, ask what they learned in school today, check their homework, and ask the teachers or write a note with any questions you may have about what is being taught. (COMMON CORE is different than what we were taught in school) Know what is a 1  score answer and a 4 score answer. \nDon\'t complain to other parents but speak to the teacher or send a note with your child to let the principal know or send email. \n\nThis way you are not surprised if your child did not do well or that nothing has been done about the issues at hand.\n\n\nOn a positive note, Soto has made improvements\nAll children are dismissed in a playground not in the street. \nRequiring the AP\'s to be present during lunch time.(I\'ll ask my child if it has helped and is a permanent fix or temporary one) Ms.Maria is now not being mean and spiteful esp to boys. (I follow up with my child)\nChanging the procedure for lateness. \nHave more positive family nights.\n\nAlso Ms. Glowgower (sp), science teacher is very strict, no excuses but that applies to every kid but she is an excellent science teacher. My kid got a 2 b/c he forgot to do his homework but that teaches him responsibility and also I just keep on top of him, asking if there is homework,or a test. But  Ms.Glowgower (sp?) lessons  will prepare your child for the State Science test. Just review all what they learned in her class. \n  \nBut changes happened  with parent involvement and sometimes calling district to find out what is proper procedure. Don\'t be afraid to call District to ask questions,(whatever is said is confidential) or read up on  DOE regulations, so your child is safe and educated during school.  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS, if the information the school tells (from teachers, AP,principal guidance counselor ) doesn\'t feel right to you, call district and find out the right information or check the DOE website. Believe me I was second guessing myself and was afraid to speak out in case my child got backlash but it never did and changes were made. This will help where ever your child goes to school.']"

The administrative do not work with parents In communication and such, they also take the bullies side when a situation happens. There was also sexual harassment that occurs as well, students will pick on others to an extent where street fights may/will occur. It will even travel to other schools, or become worse online. Administration also were calling kids Pig and joking about their clothing. Worst administrative ever, Mr. Miller (Principal), Mrs. Brodsky (Dean), Mrs. Alexiou (Assistant principal).', ""I'm an 8th grader now and I moved before the year began after 5 months into the the school year i came back and when i called to see if i could be in my 8th grade class i was suppose to be in this lady who was really nice but she seemed like she didn't like me got a little mad  i don't understand why and she ended up putting me in an honors academy that i wasn't suppose to be in.So it was my first day in the honors academy and i didn't understand a thing.The classes were to hard and advance so i didn't understand a single thing they we saying so i ended up the whole day being clueless since i didn't understand a thing.And some of the people in my class were really rude and annoying to the teacher so the teachers talked to the student but they wouldn't listen and the bad part was the teachers wouldn't teach after a problem with one of the student.Also after that first experience in a different academy since i was in academy a before and still have to be in it for my final year i literally wish i would never go back to that class and academy it was the worst experience i ever had to face in my life.And i know some of you might look at this saying why is this person complaining so much and its not a big deal but for me it is since im just a 13 year old nobody would take a kid seriously only adults but i believe we all have a say in this worlds even if it not good.But i think is very unfair to some 13 year olds to not be taken serious sometimes just because were still considered kids and we are but some of us have alot to say that a adult would say.Anyways im sorry if u think this was a waste of your time reading about someone you don't even knows problems at school.But as my music teacher says sometimes we all need to be hear."", 'If you\'re Asian and your face shows it, be prepared to experience some bullying and harassment by your peers. This school has a large Hispanic population, the majority of whom are lacking behind in their academics. It\'s always the Asians who get picked on by their race. When I was in 6th grade, some of the 8th graders would shout at me, ""Chino!"" even though I was not Chinese. The majority of the students are ignorant. The only place where you\'ll find comfort and security is if you\'re in the SP Honors, which is much better than Honors class. The Honors class has some rowdy kids, so make sure your child gets outstanding grade so that he/she can be in SP Honors. No one actually bullied me about my race in SP Honors, they teased me about it sometimes, but in a playful manner which I excused. I\'ve been in SP Honors for all throughout 6th, 7th, and 8th grade and never once have I seen a fight between members in my class. 6th and 7th grade SP Honors class has some kids who don\'t belong there, but by 8th grade, everything will be within their place. \n\nHow your child turns out in this school depends on your child. If he/she hangs out with the bad crowd (which is the majority of this school), then he/she WILL turn out bad. However, if your child hangs out with the good students, then he/she will become good. I\'m not promoting the SP Honors class, but it\'s the only class in this school that has the most positive environment, and all the brilliant kids go there. \n\nYour child might get placed in a ""normal"" class, which is full of bad kids, but if your child maintains an excellent grade all throughout that year and hangs out with positive people, then next year, he/she will be in SP Honors. That\'s what happened to one of my friends, Liz. She was placed in a bad class, but she knew what was right and wrong, and hanged out with the nice, well-mannered kids in that class (only about 2 kids, but hey, better than none). She was the smartest in that class (what do you expect- that class\'s full of bad, I-don\'t-care-about-school kids) and next year, she got placed in the SP Honors. Once she got placed in that class, Liz wasn\'t the smartest, since everyone was bright, but she did try her best and maintained her grades above 90%. When I asked Liz if she likes this class, she said, ""Obviously. Better than my old class."" \n\nAs a final note, I would strongly recommend your kids to prepare for high school in 7th grade. If you want your kids to go to a specialized school (research about high schools and ask someone who\'s a freshman for their high school directory book that was given to them in 8th grade), send them to prep courses in the summer after 7th grade ends, so that when 8th grade starts, your child will be ready to ace that SHSAT (Specialized High School Admission Test) exam, which is held in October- 2 months after 8th grade starts. \n\nThis school is wonderful as long as your child has the right friends, is in SP Honors- they have teachers who are fair, challenge you, and actually teach you something- and does not get influenced by the bad kids. I\'m currently in 8th grade (and in SP Honors), and I\'m happy with my friends and class. I may get not-so-outstanding grades in science- almost everyone in my class agrees that it\'s the hardest class out of all the other classes- but I love the challenge, and I learn a lot from my mistakes. \n\nBeing in SP Honors in 8th grade is a wonderful thing because you don\'t have to take the 8th grade NYC State Exams. Instead, you prepare for the 8th grade Regents exam for math and science. If you pass the Regents exam, you can skip some classes in high school, and take harder class (AP classes), which will allow you to skip some classes in college, which means less money to pay. \n\nAs for the deans and principle, they do their best to take care of this school. I\'m sure a lot had changed about the deans and the principal since four/ten years ago. They listen to both sides of the student during a fight/event, ask the witnesses, and make a proper decision. I\'ve been to the deans at least once per each grade to report people who\'ve bullied me, and I\'ve to say, I\'m satisfied with the outcome. Usually, they didn\'t punish the bullies- they just made them apologize to me. But after that, the bullies never bullied me again. \n\nIn conclusion, I.S.77 is a great school- as long as your child hangs out with the right crowd, gets good grades, and is in SP Honors. I\'ve matured a lot from the bullying I received by people in other classes, as well as some other issues, and I\'m grateful for my experience in this school. It made me the way that I am now, and I\'ve my peers and the teachers to thank.', 'I totally agree with you,I\'m a chinese,my classmate are mostly spanish,although they are not that bad,but yeah,I couldn\'t really get in with them,but fortunately ,most girl are really the kind of ""good friend"".

I know all of his teachers and they would have not tolerated this name calling.  Ms. Valentin would have dealt with any bullies.  We try our best to be a bully free zone.

At school, I've mastered the material that needs to be learned and the teachers here helped me see the importance in all the efforts I've put into my education, and with this comes time management. After seeing all the kids in my class who've been able to reach the same goal as mine, it’s impossible not to be inspired. The teachers don’t just teach you the material, they motivate you. Every teacher works extra hard to help you understand everything you need to and more. They go above and beyond to prepare us. By doing so, they are able to help you toward gaining a spot in your dream school,and attaining high scores. When enrolled in this class, you could see all the work they've put into you, and in the end, you can see how all the efforts have been worth it. The environment overall is pretty nice, compared to other schools in the district. The kids, for the most part, are very friendly and well mannered, you just have to know what kind of people you should hang out with, as the same goes for really, any school to be honest. The teachers, as I've mentioned before, are absolutely outstanding at doing their job. I especially recommend Ms. Govier and Ms. Puterbagh for constantly trying to help you improve your math skills and going out of their way to assist you, Mr.Wansor and Ms.Matundan, for being really understanding and accommodating whenever a student needs some extra tutoring or help (they have afterschool programs), Ms.Marino, who not only I love as an ELA teacher, but came to know as a best friend or so you could say (She has tattoos, a rad taste in music and fashion, has awesome trapeze skills, and is SUPER sarcastic and funny-Who wouldn't like her?) , Mr.Teehan, for always trying to come up with creative and fun ways to learn History, Ms.Grady for being very encouraging when it comes to working on your ELA skills, Mr.Dudin for having a sense of humor and simply existing and being there to teach us Robotics, Ms.Wei, Ms. Deangelis, and. King Memos. The faculty and staff are awesome too. For example, our principal, Dr.Feagan is always coming up with ways to make our school a better place. Recently, she's been promoting the idea of students making a change. So, from bake sales, to fundraisers, to simple donations or charity drives, she permits it all and we raise about an average about $250 for each. My morning meeting class (Homeroom) arranged a program where we collect recyclable bottles and turn them in for money we can donate to St.Jude's hospital. So far, we have raised about $283 and it's fun and we all enjoy it. So, I guess that concludes my review, I TOTALLY recommend this school for your child. As long as your child doesn't create problems, there shouldn't be one. All I can say is make your own decision and hope for the best :D"", ""P.S./I.S.119Q  is not the best school, but it is not the worst either. There are some Pros and Cons to going here or sending your child here. \nPros: \n1.The Gifted and Talented program is a good opportunity to let your gifted child unleash his/her full potential\n2.The Teachers are very kind and friendly\n3.They still push you to do your best\n4.There is a variety of teachers with different nationalities, your student could feel comfortable around\n5.The Guidance Counselor is very helpful and reassuring\n\nCons:\n1.The nurse can sometimes be so rude\n2.The Students curse a lot and there is a group of 8th Graders who already smoke\n3.Some students have VERY unruly behavior\n4.Sometimes the Gifted and Talented Students can be very rude to the Gen Ed kids.\n\nIt is up to you or your parents if you want to go here but I've shown you the good and bad sides of going to P.S./I.S.119Q.\n                                                                                            - 7th Grade student at I.S.119Q\n"", ""LMAOO GET WITH 8TH GRADERS AND THEN TALK, NO ONE'S INTO DRUGS TRUST MEEE"", "" The down side is when i was in 7th these 8th graders were selling weed to the kids in my grade in the gen ed classes. Also that same 8th grader was found having sex with another 8th grade girl last year. And imagine the fact that they both still graduated. so anyway, some people get bullied but iz mostly because they don't know how to stand up for themselves or take a joke. btw on the book they give u when u apply to the school, it says there is no uniform, but suprise suprise there is, and i learned the hard way."", 'I truly hate this school.  I hate the students, and I feel like there are too many children who are disrespectful and do not follow the rules.  For the younger grades in which uniform is required, a great majority don\'t wear their uniforms.  Too many kids cut classes by just hanging out in the hallways or staying in the bathroom.  These children are constantly cursing, whether they\'re in General Education or Gifted and Talented.  I feel that the school is too separated between the two groups.  Also, there is an extremely large amount of bullying, and it happens everywhere in the school.  The vocal and choral program is terrible.  I was stuck in the program for two years, and the teacher is the worst.  She is unorganized, and never has an actual plan.  There is nothing I\'ve learned in her class that I couldn\'t learn in five minutes online.  We have seen her cry before several times, and a large majority of the students disrespect her mainly because it is very hard to take her seriously as a teacher.  The shows for these music programs are horrible, and they are worth almost two-thirds of your grade.  I have been in the Gifted and Talented program for 3 years and it\'s fine, but I really hate the school.  The guidance counselor is horrible at her job, and she clearly shows that she cares more for troublemakers and less for those who are in the Gifted and Talented program.  It seems that to her, we are less of a priority.  So far this year, my friends and I have been pushed out her room and yelled at by her saying she\'s ""busy"" because we wanted to know whether or not she had applied us for the SHSAT.  She\'s very rude and mean, and was no help in applying for high schools.

They have separate teachers to teach us for all subjects excluding your choice of talent (Art, Band, or Chorus) and Gym. It's a intense program since you can't slack and get good averages like a 99 in each class. Right now towards the end of the year we still have work and projects due. It is a pretty hard workload and many kids are falling behind. However, the teacher's really care about you so it isn't all that bad. Some teachers may show some bias but if you're a good student it won't matter. We have core classes of math, ELA, social studies, and science. There is literally no bullying in 6th grade G and T. Everyone is everyone else's friend. The deans and principal Dr. Fagan keep things in order. Don't listen to those older comments from 2-5 years ago. Times have changed. I can't speak for any other classes but they are generally good I guess. Some kids make trouble and act reckless but I don't get affected. Our school is pretty clean although a bugs have been seen.

A large public performance for the school and our student’s parents is not the only way to showcase a theatrical presentation. We are a multi faceted school and as\nprofessional educators we can make decisions to show how we present our student work to our school community. These presentations can come in many art forms and structures. \n\nIn place of flashy Broadway productions, I chose to focus this year on the artisanal off Broaway approach to theatre.

PBIS, as stated in previous meetings, takes the average school 3-5 years to be fully operationalized. Any solid system worth its salt takes time to develop, monitor,\nanalyze and re-adjust. Regardless, IS data claims that 99% of all teachers believe that “order and discipline are maintained.” \n\nI find your statement that staff members “don’t trust one another” to be odd and perplexing.

WE do all of the above, and WE do it with panache.\n\nYour observation about “lectures” and teachers “instructed not to collaborate” is also contradictory.
