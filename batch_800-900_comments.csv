25Q200,"[""I am a graduate of P.s/M.s 200Q and as I sit on my couch upset at the fact that I will not be returning for another amazing year, I am appalled at some of these comments. I have been attending P.s 200 since pre-k and all of my siblings went or go there too. Throughout all these years I still have no complaints. The only complaint I have is that it is not a high school. I have made so many friends in that school including some best friends.  Whenever I was upset my teachers would know and they would help me through my problems, wether it was drama or stress from school. P.s 200 isn't a school it is a family and I would do anything to go back. P.s 200 is a school where every teacher knows your name and every teacher cares. I have bonded with all of my teachers and will miss all of them personal. I will even miss the teachers that I didn't have the pleasure to study with because no matter what all the teachers would check up on you. P.s 200 was amazing academic wise and extra curricular wise. I was never bored in that school. I was always looking forward to something, wether it was all of our amazingly fun assemblys, all the fun battle of the classes, the teacher verses student sports tournaments or the drama and music classes. P.s 200 is a place to explore your interests, every Friday we would have a free period to join a club, wether it was school photography, writing, leaning through media or drama it was always fun. I was in school spirit and photography and media, I always had a blast wether it was helping out at bake sales, creating posters, creating inspiring videos using all the diverse children in our school or cutting out paper hearts. All of the teachers inspire the students to work hard to achieve their goals. Even if that student showed no interest at all the teachers would not give up. I am 100% proud to say I went to a school that wasn't just a school but a loving and understanding family.

I remember getting in detention seriously just for the dean not being able to identify the color of my pants when they were so clearly black, as the dress code demands. The teachers are not motivational at all, they either give you a lot of homework or give you nearly nothing. And the latter is definitely present in lazy teachers. If you're not in an honors class (with people who don't deserve it whatsoever of course!) you're basically treated with so much disrespect. I was lucky enough to be in them all my 3 years, but seeing other kids being maltreated just for not meeting the school's scores is outrageous. The houses are made a big deal of, yet we barely even touch on them. Walking through the school feels unsafe, and you're constantly prone to being tripped or being screamed at by some bigot trying to scare you.

They come in when the students start school, muster, to second period. I came in as the brother of my younger sister to see what her classes are like and how they differ when I attended. The first class I visited was my younger sister’s social studies class and I came to one of the most fascinating class I ever attended. The students were learning about the Vietnam War and the teacher brought in a person that lived through that time period and had firsthand experience of the war and the journey of a refuge. I loved that the teacher brought in a living piece of history to have a different style of teaching a topic. College was always about lectures, learning from the textbook and almost never bringing in an actual person to learn from a different angle.\n\nThe second class I visited was my sister’s health class. The environment that was created by the teacher seemed to keep a very open discussion about touchy health topics. Many of these topics within the health class were taboo within a family setting and many parents feel uncomfortable talking about it. The teacher created an healthy environment where kids can be speak their opinions about a topics and not be judged.\n\nOverall, I have to say the school is a step up of what it used to be when I attended 5 years ago.

I was nervous at first because it is a huge transition from elementary to middle school. The current middle school assistant principal, Mrs. Poulos took me under her wing and made me feel very comfortable and safe in school.  In the seventh grade I had two teachers in almost every class. I can say that that was the most helpful thing towards my academic life. I had 85s and above in all my classes. As I went on to 8th, 9th and 10th grade I did not have an extra teacher in the classroom. I struggled, but it was not the teachers fault. The teachers did in fact the exact opposite and did everything in their power to help me succeed. During my junior year I had two teachers in almost every class again, which was extremely helpful because junior year is a tough year. For the first time I’ve had an average of 91 which is a huge deal for me. Our principal Dr. Werner has been at the school for only three years and has already made significant changes to better the school. Dr. Werner cares for every single student and helps out in any possible way she can.  She influenced me to join Student government my junior year and it was a way for me to express my ideas on how to improve our school as a whole or just a grade. Dr. Werner also asked me to join SLT (Student Leadership Team)  which allows teachers, administration, parents, and students to see our school as a whole and give our input and perspectives on ideas that could benefit the school and/or students. Not only Dr. Werner but also the teachers have made a positive impact on me. The teachers pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me do things I never knew I was capable of. They have the determination and ambition to see students succeed which is why I love the school so much. The teachers and staff are amazing. I know I can talk to any teacher because I feel very comfortable opening up to them and because we are a very small school, all the teachers and students know each other.  This allows students to create a connection with their teachers. It makes it feel more as a community rather than your average high school where there is a thousand kids in one grade and you don’t necessarily know everyone in your OWN grade. My friend Abigail and I put together an assembly in honor of teacher appreciation week with the help of our principal Dr. Werner. We came together and shared ideas on how we can get our message across to show that we truly appreciate the teachers. They are one of a kind teachers that you can never get anywhere else.

It took me a long time in 8th grade to decide where I wanted to go to high school and didn't know which school was the best fit. After months of discussing the decision with my middle school guidance counselor and parents, we decided on WJPS. Looking back , it was the best decision I've made. The small school environment and population gives students the opportunity to form close and supportive friend groups. In addition, the small school allows students to form relationships with the teachers and administration . Ask any student in the school , everyone has a teacher they can go to for advice , academic troubles , and just to talk. The teaching staff is amazing. They are supportive, always available and have a true urge to make sure every student has what they need to be successful . The administration has done a phenomenal job these past 3 years. Every administrator takes the time to know every student, to encourage student involvement , and always have an open door at all times. Anyone who tells you this school isn't academical challenging ... they are wrong. The school offers a variety of AP courses, and partners with Queens and Queensborough Community college to offer college now courses to every students. The school maintains high pass rights on regents and AP exams. Every teacher is more than qualified to teach these courses. Academics in WJPS are on par with other bigger high schools in Queens.  Students are offered a variety of extracurricular activities to take part in. This year the school has done a great job of making sure every club is running efficiently and has the resources they need to grow. If there is club you wanna start, the school willing will help students create their own clubs and will support the student until the end. If you are considering WJPS, you will not regret it. My high school experience so far has been the best and I am thankful for every staff member that has made it so great to go to school every day.

My children’s needs were met, the work load, the AP classes offered, the tests, the social aspect, I have absolutely no complaints.  The teachers and admin staff has always addressed all my concerns, including when I feel my child needed more guidance, and help. They have also been very proactive in being strong with guiding all children who attend towards acceptance and empathy towards their fellow citizens. The Sr Admin is far from the incompetent accusation I saw posted below.  My child, who is graduating, was accepted to ALL colleges applied for with very decent academic scholarship offers.  My child's SAT score was in the 1300's without supers-coring it and I thank WJPS for setting the groundwork, and foundation, for what to expect in competitive colleges.  My youngest is doing very well also. This school encourages the students to think outside the box, ask questions and to see things differently sometimes, to help shape them.   I am a very happy and satisfied parent of a current student who is active in the school, and needs a little push here and there academically and my child gets it, the teachers, the staff, they are there and behind my child 100%.

Biggest mistake of our lives and I want all parents to really consider your choices.  We liked the cozy student population and the journalism theme.  Unfortunately, we quickly realized that with the small number of students it meant that every class was slowed significantly so that the slowest learners can keep up.  So any above average student will excel in their grades but it's based on a very low curve.  Another issue came up when my child was ready to take a regents class and the school cancelled the regents class without announcement at the beginning of the school year.  The official explanation we received was that the previous classes did not perform well and the administration decided that instead of trying to pressure students to perform it would be better to do away with the regents class offering.  Sounds to me that they could not adequately teach the students and instead of reporting lower scores for students and teachers they decided that lowering expectations was the answer.  It sounds very convenient to the teachers involved but it's a tragedy for the students.  The overall vibe we perceived was that teachers were not up to par in teaching their respective classes.

During all their changes, Ryan has been their to guide and encourages them. From the workshop in helping dealing with adolescent behavior to high school workshops. This school is great with providing parents and well as students with the tools they need to succeed. After school programs and activities are a great way for them to express themselves and find interest to encourage social skills. From robotics to roadrunners and i just want to say GO LIONS!!

I would like to think that because they have a good principal,  Dr. Landeau, to lead by example. From the weekly calls to keep parents informed of events to the wow words, Dr. Landeau had always made time to say hello or discuss something serious.

This gave me the chance to see how the staff actually think and work for the students to make sure they succeed. The school helped graduates and their parents throw the process of high school. One fact, if the parents got involved with school , they can see how the school perform and they can see the influence on the students. 2 of my kids were in honor classes, one was in regular class and one was in special ED class.

No child can reach their full potential while living in constant fear for their safety at the same time.', 'I have some concerns about the way this school has handled multiple cases of children being injured and children being bullied. I have friends and family with kids and siblings that go to this school and it really worries me and upsets me that better action and precautions are not being taken.', ""It has to be terrifying for a parent to have their children in a school where they have to be concerned about their safety.  We know that bad things happen and that there are bullies, but the least a parent should be able to expect from their child's school is that when such incidents happen, that they are dealt with appropriately so as to properly care for any children injured and prevent further incidents.  And, in such incidents, if a parent is upset and showing concern for their child, rightfully so!  This should not be ignored or pushed aside. \n\nIt’s evident that the school is overcrowded and understaffed.  But when we are responsible for the children in our community, then we need to step up and ensure that their safety is primary.  There needs to be some type of resolution, and the school could stand to use some input from the community.  I would feel much better if the school at least welcomed input and collaboration from the community, as opposed to shutting the community out, in particular the parents."", 'It\'s unfortunate that children from my community including my niece have to attend a school that is understaffed and simply ignores acts of bullying. No proper reports are made but rather simply referred as ""accidents"". It\'s terrifying knowing I have to send my niece to a school where anything that happens can be called an accident when in reality it may be bullying. The physical trauma as well as the mental trauma that children who experience bullying, is unacceptable. The staff needs proper training or education to prevent such events, the staff also needs to learn to handle these situations the right way. ', 'The administration of P.S. 124Q is disgraceful, disrespectful, and concerning. As a community member with nieces and nephews who attend this institution, I am highly concerned for the type of care, education, and accommodations our children receive when they walk into P.S. 124 five days a week. Specifically, the Assistant Principal is rude, disrespectful and unprofessional with concerned parents. The Interim-Principal at the institution demonstrates a lack of empathy when dealing with conflicts that involve bullied children, as well as children who have suffered permanent physical injuries as a result of such bullying. However, as constituents of the community we need to raise a concern of the administration of P.S.124 to those who employ such unqualified individuals such as the Assistant Principal and Interim Principal at the institution. After a further investigation, I have learned that P.S.124 also have never executed a by-laws. Rather, P.S.124 employs a ""grab out of the hat"" voting policy that ensures anonymity and protects it from any claims of bias or interest. It is also highly concerning that the administration at P.S.124 become so involved and interested in the conflicts of students and parents that they take sides of other parents thereby demeaning the concern and requests of a complaining parent. This comment responds from the most common bullying incident where a 7 year old boy was bullied by another. The school not only refused to write an incident report but failed to find an appropriate disposition; refused to empathize with the complaining parent, refused to accommodate the child who is suffering physical injuries; intentionally placed the victim child back into a dangerous position where he is susceptible to injuries from his bully; negligently managed lunch aides during the lunch hour [which is when the incident occurred; the lunch aide did not even know a child was being bullied]; negligently managed the nurse aides who place victims of bullying back into public areas of the school; unprofessionally involved themselves in parental conflict by yelling at a concerned parent at a meeting that was intended to be restorative in nature, but not in practice; and the school administration, specifically the Assistant Principal was negligent when she failed to fill out the necessary paperwork correctly, which she had a duty to do so, and she failed to carry out such duty. Such incompetent administration should not be tolerated. The Department of Education should investigate this matter, and all students at P.S.124 should be interviewed with respect to their experience at the school.', 'This whole story is outrageous and very disappointing. I am so sorry that these children and families had to endure this. There must be something that can be done-even if involves getting media attention.', ""I am a concerned community member and the way bullying is being addressed is unacceptable.  When a child is beaten by another child at school, it is up to the school to deal with this efficiently.  Parents leave their kids with the school believing that it is a safe and secure environment.  From what I've heard about this school, students have been assaulted and nothing's been done.  Being lax about discipline could send a message to the assaulters that it is okay and that their assaults will go unpunished.  A school is supposed to be a safe place to learn and if my child was assaulted and nothing was done I'd be exasperated."", 'While I\'m not clear on how the law works in NYC, here in NJ something called a Harassment and Bullying (HAB) Report is filed for every claim made by a child or parent, followed by a thorough investigation with both parties. My understanding is that not only was the decision to label this ""incident"", as an ""accident"", almost instantaneous, but the handling of the matter thereafter was treated with seemingly zero compassion for both the victim and his mother. Literal insult to literal injury. I also understand the story on record indicates there was a game in place, involving hand movements. How a hand game led to a smashed face in a table resulting in permanent dental damage, becomes lessened to a mere (hands in the air) mishap, is beyond me.  How a Principal\'s office and Superintendent\'s office alike, can rehash the words ""accident, accident, accident"" to a mother who has to (a) come up with the funds to repair what she can of her son\'s teeth, (b) come up with the words to repair what she can of her son\'s spirit and (c) come up with patience to keep her composure while be shooed away and snickered at, is also - beyond me. \n\nMore attention and care needs to be given to the handling of these ""incidents"". I hope those in the position to make changes for the better, will do so. ', ""The bullying and the aftermath is pretty terrible. These types of incidents should NOT be tolerated or even part of the educational experience and yet this school is a prime example of what's wrong with our society. The schools lack of willingness to assist the bullying problem is terrible."", 'On Tuesday, June 16, 2015 during the last School Leadership Team meeting of the 2014-2015 school year, I asked the parent coordinator about the process of having a CBO (community based organization) join the SLT team at P.S. 124. She informed me that for as long as she has been at the school, no CBO’s are allowed on the team. \n\n\tAs per the Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 (Article II - Team Composition, Attachment No. 4, Section 4, pgs. 1-2), it states: “Community based organizations may also serve on SLTs. The SLT will create a process for the organizations to apply for membership. A member of the team may also recommend an organization for membership. This will be done on an annual basis. Community based organization members will be included in the total number of team members, but will not be counted when determining the balance of parent and staff members.” I asked her to please advise as to the process the SLT of P.S. 124 should have in place for CBO’s. \n\n\tIn addition, when I asked the SLT team what the process was for choosing parents to serve on the SLT this past school year, the response was that names were chosen out of a brown paper bag for those positions. When I asked if that was the customary process for choosing parents, the response was “yes.” When I asked how long the term was for parents, the current PTA president looked at the rest of the team and asked, “What are our Bylaws?” as the entire team looked perplexed. The interim principal finally interjected and said it was 1 year. When I asked what the Bylaws of P.S. 124 are in accordance with this matter, there was no response. I am unclear as to why the Bylaws of the School Leadership Team of P.S. 124 are not completed in written form.\n\n\tAs per the Chancellor Regulation A-655 (Article II- Team Composition, Attachment No. 4, Section 4, pg. 1), it states: “Election of Team Members Parent and staff SLT members must be elected by their own constituent group in a fair and unbiased manner determined by each constituent group. All elections must be advertised widely, with reasonable advance notice given. Elections must be open to all members of the constituent group and must be held in accordance with the term limits set forth in these bylaws. Parent member elections must be scheduled after PA/PTA elections are held each Spring. Parents must be provided a minimum of ten calendar days notice prior to the election. The PA/PTA is encouraged to stagger the terms of the non-mandatory parent members of the SLT.”\n\nI informed the parent coordinator that I would like to apply to be on the School Leadership Team for the coming school year of 2015-2016 and to let me know what form(s) I need to follow through with in order to begin that process.', ""Hi, I am in support of my good friend Mala Sookdeo on the bullying of her 1st grade son and daughter a few weeks ago. It's kind of surprising that this school or any school for that matter would let such an act take place with no disciplinary action taken to the culprit. What are we teaching are kids? ...how to hit other kids and be successful or to be productive members of society one day? ...is this even a school? ... something has to be done soon to address and correct this matter or this will be taken up on a higher level until the correct steps are taken to protect everyones kid when they are in school ..."", ""I've heard of multiple bullying incidents taking place in this school one where a child's two front teeth were knocked out by another student at the school and no disciplinary action was taken place and the bully got away scott-free. "", ""On 5/29/15 my 1st grade son was a victim of bullying when his head was smashed into a lunch table by one of his classmates. The child broke my son’s front, permanent teeth. The school aides should have been watching my son’s class and was not. I have been going through the proper protocol of speaking with the AP (who deals with the younger grades), the guidance counselor, and the principal to address my concerns. I requested a meeting with the child’s parents to which the principal declined to be present. The AP yelled at me during the meeting, creating a very hostile environment. The child that did this to my son was not suspended as per the Chancellor’s Regulations that addresses infractions linked to disciplinary actions. \n\nThere was another bullying incident with my daughter 3 weeks prior when two classmates kicked and punched her in the schoolyard during recess. The school aide took a written statement from my daughter and made a copy for her to give to me. She was supposed to give her copy to the guidance counselor. She put the statement in her bag and went home. I was not notified by the school.  When I went to the school the next day to address the bullying issue, the AP was completely unaware that anything happened. She took statements from my daughter and the bullies as well as other children involved. On 6/3/15, I asked for the copy of the online report she should have filed. She told me she never filed a report because my daughter had no injuries. I responded saying that it is a bullying incident report that should have been filed. She claimed she gave the bullies 3 days of lunch detention. When I reminded her that she previously called me and told me she gave the bullies 5 days lunch detention, she then yelled at me in front of everyone in the main office and said, “‘I’m done with you! Have a nice day!”\n\nDuring that same week my son was injured, another child broke his arm during recess. \n\nOn 6/11/15 there was another incident with a 5th grader on the school bus who pulled a knife on his classmates. He threatened to kill them if they told on him. From what I understand, the child was on medication. This child should have been supervised at all times. The mother said the school did not call her about the situation. She found out from her son when he got dismissed from school. \n\nA parent came up to me who said a child was being bullied and had water bottles thrown at him. The administration told the mother it was her son’s fault because he made a racial comment. \n\nThe school is excessively overcrowded and there is not enough lunch aides to handle over 1,300 children.  I am disturbed by the pattern of particularly violent children who are not being reprimanded for their physical attacks. Instead, the victims are made to feel as it is their fault that they have been targeted and attacked. \n\nI went to the DFA and superintendent for my district. They both said the child involved in my son’s assault will not be suspended because they did a full investigation and concluded it was an accident. They have yet to take a statement from my son. Therefore, a complete investigation was not performed. The lack of adhering to the chancellor’s protocol and the unprofessionalism the administration shows to the parents is an outrage. \n\nToday I went to Councilman Eric Ulrich's office to explain my son's situation and request for them to help facilitate a fair resolution. The Community Relations Advocate told me I had to go through the Department of Education and that she could only give me the chancellor's phone number and address. \n\nI am going to contact the Chancellor's office but it seems that going through the proper protocol gets me less results and more red tape. It's very frustrating and in the meantime my son is still in a school where bullies are not disciplined according to the Chancellor's Regulations for serious physical injuries. \n\nOur children are entitled to a free AND safe public education. They should not have to choose between the two."", 'are you reporting this to the superintendent and doe? are you filing a formal complaint?', ""If they don't want to acknowledge or address the issue, then you need a lawyer and a lawsuit-or a public forum where they will be exposed.

I will be taking four regents this year and let me tell you, this is school is much better than the reviews written below. The principal described in the article was fired and replaced by a man named Mr. Singh. Ms. Butcher, the old principal, was not the greatest in keeping the school in top shape. She did not have the best methods and harassed a couple of the staff members (this was the reason she was fired). However, she has left and Mr. Singh is doing a much better job.\n   Our school is divided into academies and have certain programs that students in their individual sections can do. For example, the Visual Arts academy has classes such as theatre and can perform during our spring and winter festivals. In addition to that, rumors about teachers being ""terrible"" are not true. The staff at our school are nice people and can teach well. Many say that the teachers are bad due to their behavior and attitudes towards the teachers\n   There are fights that occur in our school but that should not affect you in any way unless you\'re involved. Many also say they do not feel safe but absolutely nothing has happened that can ruin your life. The students are not threatening or very dangerous but they do have bad behavior; it\'s just a case of a ""bad attitude."" \n   Lunch isn\'t the greatest but that is not the school\'s fault, every other middle school in New York City is serving the same food. The cafeteria can be dirty due to the students who aren\'t capable of throwing out their garbage but, there aren\'t things such as food stuck to the walls.\n   Personally, I love this school for the way it is but I wouldn\'t say it was your best option for middle school. If you\'re here to get a good, regular education, Ms 210 is the place for you. However, if you\'d like an amazing education, you can earn it by getting grades to get you into an accelerated class (90 and above but, try striving for grades in the principal\'s honor roll range which is 94 and above. It\'ll guarantee you the chance of getting into an AP class). The curriculum is better and you get preparation for the regents (high school credits!). Being in an AP class gives you a larger work load but, if you aren\'t good with large loads of homework, a regular class would be best for you (I typically get 2-4 medium sized assignments everyday but that also depends on your teachers). \n   I hope this review helped and can help you choose your child\'s new middle school. If you are a student who is already ATTENDING the school, look on the bright side if your days here are going rough.

Unless you have been friends with them since Kindergarten, TRUST NO-ONE!\n•Mind your own business when people are doing bad OR POSSIBLY ILLEGAL things or things they SHOULDN\'T be doing, just walk away. (THIS IS ANOTHER THING I REGRET NOT DOING. SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN AND IT WILL NOT, I REPEAT, WILL NOT END WELL FOR YOU OR ANYONE)\n•Don\'t act like the sheep or act scared, be yourself and if someone pushes you around, defend yourself!\n•Definitely do your homework and classwork but don\'t try TOO hard. Do it enough to get a good grade. \n•Get to school ON TIME, some Houses will penalize you for be late, possibly detention or parents being called.\n•Read the first tip!!!\n\nThis school has taught me lessons that I will always take with me in the \nfuture (in terms of street smarts), it has made me tougher, and stronger in my experience. I will never forget the things that have happened \nthere. \n\nMake TRUE friends, do your homework, stay strong and you will have a decent time!\n\nP.S.

27Q306,"['I have to agree that PS306 has not been the same since Flandro left.  The many wonderful teachers that started that school and made it a family have slowly dissipated.  The bonds they created with our children are priceless and immeasurable.  My oldest son was able to be a part of that complete warmth and love until 4th grade, but sadly my youngest was not.  If not for his friends and the teachers, I would have transferred him.  Up to recently I was asked ""When is Mrs. Flandro coming back, I miss her"", my oldest prayed that Mrs. Flandro would surprise them for graduation and be there, he said she should have been the one that was there, and he was so disappointed that the yearbook didn\'t even mention her, he said her picture should have been there in the front. His almost entire existence at 306 was with Flandro.  She knew how to treat her staff as well as the parents and children. \n\nIt would always surprise me at events of how many of the teachers would be there with their family.  It was such a wonderful and rare thing.  I used to boast about how wonderful the school was and how much it felt like family, where all the teachers knew all the children and parents alike.  We were encouraged to be a huge part of our children\'s education at school as well, not just at home, and we were made to feel welcomed by the school.  The teachers and parents didn\'t mind putting in the extra time and effort because there was mutual respect and admiration for one another, and boy did the children benefit, so much love and concern at school from teachers...(I mean who ever heard of such a thing)...it seemed like something from the movies, but it was our wonderful reality. When it came down to it, Flandro would get to work with the teachers and help everything, even at the events.  She was a genuine, welcoming smiling face whenever you walked into the school and will be sorely missed.  She knew every child\'s name, their sibling and parent or relative. She was truly a leader.  She created a wonderful school and it is so sad to see what it has become. \n\nIt feels so cold and uninviting now that I don\'t even feel comfortable calling in to ask questions anymore.  I used to be able to call the office and say ""Hi, my name is so and my kids are"", but before I could say who my kids were, Mrs. Basso, another great loss and wonderfully genuine smile at the school, would say, Hi. Ms. so and so, and she already knew who I was.  But even if she didn\'t know my name you could tell she was smiling and easy to talk to.  I pray that Mr. Kalamaras, another great leader at the school does not go, as well as the other wonderful teachers there.  But it is NOT the teachers that make this school feel cold and uninviting now.', 'You have taken the words right out of my mouth!  It is so comforting to know that I am not alone in feeling what I do.  Overall, all the teachers are quite amazing.  Isn\'t it bizarre that since Ms. Leone\'s arrival, things have gone down hill. I am so disappointed.  It\'s about time parents such as yourself are voicing your opinions as it does matter!  I pray that the administration changes and we see someone new come in who is actually there for the kids and the staff, and doesn\'t have to have anything ""REQUIRED.""', 'Thank you so  much.  I hope other parents will come out and say how they feel too so we can take our school back for our children.  We are losing excellent teachers and its not fair to our children or to the teachers.  I hope the Board of Ed really takes into consideration what the parents are saying and takes notice and even question why so many teachers who were here from the opening of this school are now suddenly leaving under new management.  Why are our teachers so unhappy after years of nurturing and happiness with our children and with Flandro.  \n\nMany children have also lost the respect that Flandro instilled in the kids when she was there.  You wouldn\'t see kids running in the hall or shouting out.  She taught the kids to have respect for everyone, teachers, parents and each other.  She also made sure kids kept their hands to themselves, no hitting or touching, playing or otherwise.  Her motto, ""We keep our hands and feet to ourselves"".\n\nWe need to spread the word.  Parents need to write letters to our superintendent or send emails to let them know how we feel about what is going on, even write our feelings on sites like this if we have to.  We need to be heard for the sake of our children.', ""I have to agree with Clara, we have lost so many great teachers since Mrs Flandro's absence. Definetely the demeanor of teachers and students have taken a turn that most of the parents can't help but wonder why. It is truly sad to see that we are no longer a closed family but only parents and strangers, and no much will be accomplished and our the students and the reputation of the school are going to ultimately be one more stratistic of a mediocre school. I can only hope that the chance to revert the negative comes soon through communication, flexibility, understanding, and above all unconditional love and care for the children, because at the end of the day, money and reputation will never replace the sincere admiration, gratitude, cooperation and love that we used to have. My suggestions, make the children feel welcome, Mr. Kalamaras was always outside in the mornings waiting for them, Mrs Flandro was always talking to the children, she showed them love and respect, Mrs Marino an excellent teacher. Leadership is not just a title, a salary, ego, or a benefit, leadership is a skill, is being able to be flexible, is know how to listen, and care, leadership is about be a fair team player, and most of all an approachable person so that all the people below will have the encouragement to work together and keep us parents supporting their hard work and goals. I miss the old PS 306 and I really wish we could get all those excellent teachers back."", 'It is quite sad to me that such a wonderful school has taken a turn.  Since Ms. Flandro\'s leave this past year, the school\'s culture has truly changed.  The teachers and staff continue to put their all into the students, it is the administration on the other hand that does not.  To them it is all about the appearances, rather than what matters most...the children.  My children have told me that of too many instances where they are unhappy.  If it weren\'t for the staff, I would have removed my children. On a daily basis, my childrens\' learning is constantly interrupted with the constant announcements over the speaker, with birthdays, teacher, meetings, etc., Doesn\'t learning come first?  Why not have the announcements done Monday mornings, rather than on a daily basis.  How about the day that my child SAT outside in the cold for 45 minutes in less than 60 degree weather while the principal decided that this would be a great moment to have her staff look at bulletin boards?!  This is absolutely absurd to me!  Attendance to most events at the school as declined. It is sad to me to see so many staff members looking so sad and wanting to leave a school that they/we cherished for so long.  More and more teachers are going to want to leave if Ms. Leone stays.  As of right now she is ""Acting Principal,"" I hope that it does not become the permanent principal!']"
