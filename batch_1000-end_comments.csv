Our child’s fourth grade report card was all 4s, state test scores were double 4s (ELA/Math) and perfect attendance. We put NEST+m first on the application list for middle school as it is geographically easier to get to for us, but our child is on the wait list behind more than 200 other applicants.  We are content staying at our current school as it goes to 8th grade, but what caught our eye is the selection criteria/ factors for selection to NEST+m middle school.  Specifically for students from BSI and District 30 (Q300) where the “Performance Indicators” is weighted at 20% whereas at other schools it is less or not a factor at all.  We asked our current elementary school and they had no idea what “Performance Indicators, as assessed by the elementary school” is, nor did they report anything other than: report card grades, attendance and state test scores for admissions.  \n\nDoes attending BSI or Q300 lower your chances to attend a screened middle or high school?\n\nDoes anyone know how the “Performance Indicators” score is calculated and/or what it is?  And why are the Performance Indicators weighted the highest (20%) for BSI/ District 30 Q300?\n\nDoes anyone know the percentage of ""Performance Indicators"" for Anderson and TAG?  Is it 20% as well?\n\nWe realize that students from other districts/ schools may be less represented at NEST+m so can understand the need to give different weights and have different criteria to obtain diversity at NEST+m middle school.  At the same time, we feel that parents should be aware of the process/ criteria so they can make informed decisions.  We are simply looking for transparency.  Parents considering/ deciding on an elementary or middle school like BSI or Q300 (or other G&Ts) would probably like to know how their current decisions will affect their future options.\n\nThat said, are “Performance Indicators” used in the high school admissions process?   \n\nSpecifically: do screened high schools use the same criteria/Performance Indicators?  Ie. Millennium, Baruch, Lab School, Bard, Beacon and Nest+m high school.  Or was it purely based on merit for admissions announced in 2020?  \n\nPicture quality is low as InsideSchools has a format/size constraints. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf28640d031b894277032bf88e80757547021e66683b247eca7791cd6bdcb513.jpg', ""@G.P.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes and no. If the chancellor and mayor has their way in the coming years admissions to specialized schools will be awarded to the top 7% of every middle school. So in top middle schools where usually a majority are offered a spot to one of the specialized schools, that will change to only the top handful. When and if this policy takes effect, it would push some parents to enroll in lower performing schools knowing that their child will be more likely in that top 7%.\n\nYou should look at current admissions criteria of screened HS you may be interested in the future. Some will stay the same, and some will change but you will at least get an idea. In the case of Baruch in previous years they took in the top applicants in its home district 2. Now it's a virtual lottery where any student in the home district with an 85 or higher average has an equal chance. Same goes for Lab High School.\n\nRe: NEST, it is virtually impossible to get in at the middle school level as just about every 5th grader stays on for the middle grades.

Gone were the days of red and green cards, replaced with mindfulness time and guaranteed recess.  His first-grade teacher Christina Baron remains the best teacher he’s ever had.  She truly understood the challenge of teaching a gifted and talented child and was able to motivate him in ways that we have not seen since.  He had a specific technology teacher as well as a Spanish teacher and he regaled us with stories of well-rounded and exiting days.\n\nUnfortunately, although slow at first, the culture has changed at the school since the founding principal left.  There seems to have been an exodus of talented teachers and those who remain seem to be moved around to fill whatever DOE required void there is to fill.  He’s lost both his technology teacher and his Spanish teacher this year alone.  Also gone, the social worker, and original member of the school. \n\nWe were so convinced of this school’s progressive mission at the beginning that we were willing to be guinea pigs for it, knowing that each year he would have a new (to the school) teacher.  At this point, I would not make that decision again. This doesn’t feel special anymore.\nI hope that for the sake of parents who want progressive education and the kids who thrive on it, this school turns back to its original core values.  I hope great teachers like Christina Baron stay and the school fills itself with other teachers who share her vision and are as capable.', 'Q300 ES was ranked #1 in NY state by School Digger for 2016-2017 in Dec 2017 https://www.schooldigger.com/go/NY/schoolrank.aspx', 'Q300 will be hosting a middle school open house on Tuesday, November 21, from 5:30 - 7:00 pm at the middle school (31-51 21st St., Long Island City, co-located with IS 126).  Following an overview of the school by the principal, Bill Biniaris, interested families will have the opportunity to tour the school space and speak with teachers, students and parents.', ""I am in 8th grade. I find the homework tough and easy but, mostly tough.\nI recommend 6th to 8th graders to this school. The principal Mr. Biniaris is the nicest person I have ever met. He makes sure everything is under control which includes 0% bullying, highly adapting to new kids with all sorts of disabilities. All the teachers are willing to help kids.\nOne teacher named Laura said that she willing to learn to use snap and read and co writer for me, best of all she said almost instantly!! My old school principal (I prefer to not name her) was called by my mom fighting for my rights for assistive tech. Q300 fully accomplish this task in 2 months while my old school hasn't accomplish in 3 years!!!!!\nLook at the difference!!\nI say Q300 is one of the best schools in new york."", ""We have a first grader who has been at Q300 for two years and our experience has been extremely positive thus far. What I value most about the school is that the academics are rigorous but the approach is creative and individualized--instead of learning by rote or doing worksheets and drills, the kids are given open-ended and imaginative assignments, with lots of team and project-based work. There's also a serious emphasis on social emotional development and we have noticed a real difference in our daughter's confidence and problem-solving skills. Her teacher sends thorough emails at least weekly describing what the kids are learning and we have many opportunities to visit the classroom and get more involved. The PTA also does a lot to build community (always a challenge for a citywide school) and raises money for TAs and enrichments like music and architecture. All in all, we've been very pleased."", ""Our daughter is currently a first grader at Q300, and have generally relished every minute of it. We loved and believed deeply in Matt's vision, but at this stage the school may be even better served by Principal Bill (Biniaris, late of PS 122's G & T/PS 70) and his deep experience in math/pedagogy. It's been a growth year in the best possible way. The teachers are ultra-committed, and super-communicative; I get feedback on classroom activity and my child's participation nigh-daily. If there's one area that's been a challenge-- if largely because of the size of the school-- it's been securing and delivering resources for twice-exceptional students (though generally not for lack of effort from school staff and leadership).\n\nThe parent community is both the engine and great prize of Q300; it's culturally and economically diverse, warm, unpretentious, and fun (with cook-your-own-culture potlucks and energetic holiday celebrations among the highlights). There's ample room for service and remaining involved for parents with vastly varying levels of income and free time."", 'We are in the midst of school tours and this is wonderful to hear - unfortunately we missed the Q300 tours yesterday. We prefer a progressive curriculum and emphasis on the whole child. Would you say Q300 offers this?', ""Assuredly. It's an incredibly supportive learning environment."", ""I'm not the original poster, but am a parent of a current kindergartener. I would say that yes, Q300 offers this. It is an inquiry-based school, with differentiated instruction and a strong emphasis on the social-emotional development of the children. I feel incredibly fortunate that my son is there."", ""My son is a first grader at Q300 and we have been very happy with the school and community. I feel as though he is being challenged, but in a nurturing way, and have always been comfortable reaching out to any of his teachers with questions. I get updates on the work he's been engaged in and know he's enjoying learning new things. He loves the programming class and it's exciting to see him want to do this work at home - simply because he enjoys it. The PTA is nothing short of amazing and I feel lucky he's able to have extras like great music and art programs. "", ""My son is a Kindergarten student this year (2016-2017) and we are so pleased by his experience thus far. His teacher is great at what she does and is helpful in giving feedback to students and families. This is the first year with Bill as Principal and I've been impressed with his willingness to listen to parents and, most importantly, make changes where they're needed. He does not just pay lip service to engaging parents, he truly tries to do it. Lastly, the Q300 community has been overwhelming in their welcome and support. Parents help each other out in myriad ways and that aspect of our experience has really blown me away. Q300 is a special school in so many ways and I feel very fortunate my son is a student there."", 'The school is hosting information sessions on April 19.

Students learn to recognize key words which indicate what operation is required to solve a given problems. They are encouraged to represent addition and subtraction with objects, sounds or sounds, and to visualize and draw pictures to help solve the problems. Finally they solved the problems by writing equations. Some examples of this type of assignment were on displayed on the wall outside the kindergarten classrooms during the parent-teacher conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt’s worth noting that while content of in-class math assignments may be a bit of a mystery to kindergarten parents so far, the children have been making fantastic progress in Math. Many of the earlier in-class assignments were activity based, which means the teachers aren’t able to send copies or results of the assignments home.\nExamples recent of assignments will soon be on display for parents to see during a class visit to celebrate the children’s accomplishments in math. A date has not been set for this event yet, however Jackie and Eileen will soon let us know shortly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 17th in the afternoon Jackie and Eileen have scheduled a date for parents to visit the classrooms and celebrate the kindergarteners writing, and to see their past work on display. A note for parents, Matt and the teachers encourage parents who want to visit the kindergarten class to get in touch with them and schedule a time to visit.\n\n\n\nThe kindergarteners will be very busy with field trips as the weather gets warmer. On April 30th, the kindergarten classes will go to the Queens Zoo to participate in a workshop called “WhatAnimalsEat”.  On May 5th,the kindergarteners will be going to the National Museum of Math to learn about polygons and symmetry while participating in a workshop called “Shape Shifters”. And on May 18th, they will go to Queens College to see a performance of the show Curious George.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJackie and Eileen are working plans for a stepping up ceremony in June, to celebrate\nthe kindergarteners completing their first year of school and moving up to 1st grade. \n\t\n\n\nFirst Grade:\n\n\n\nIn Math students and their families concluded our unit on Surveys with\na Math Celebration on March 13th. Students created their own survey questions, collected data from classmates, and used the data to create graphs. We are cur-\nrently working on our new measuring unit “Fish Lengths and Animal Jumps.” We will practice measuring with different units and practice comparing lengths.\n\nIn writing we are creating our own series books. Students are investigating what makes realistic fiction realistic, and learning to use patterns to help elaborate. We have also looked at realistic fiction writers including Cynthia Rylant who writes Henry and Mudge, Barbara Park who writes Junie B. Jones, David Adler who writes Cam Jansen, and Marjorie Sharmat who writes Nate the Great to help students\nguide their writing.\n\n\n\nIn art we are exploring sculpture. We have learned about artists including Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi. Students have been creating their own sculptures using materials including paper, wire, bottle tops, plastic bottles, and wood. We will visit the Noguchi Museum later this month!\n\nThe Kiskeya Sports soccer program began on March 20th and will continue for 13 weeks. The students are also continuing their music unit through the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. First Grade Soccer and Music programs are both funded by the PTA.\n\nSixth Grade:\n\n\n\nOn March 16th the sixth graders had visitors to the school to take a walk through our Humanities classroom and view student work from our current unit, River Valley Civilizations. There were five “stops” (or stations) along the way.

Recently, they experimented with buoyancy of wood, as they determined how much weight it takes to sink certain types of wood.  In math, the students are learning measuring and addition through story problems. They are exploring different ways in which to analyze and solve these problems, as well as learning underlying concepts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKindergartener father James is wrapping up his introduction to music instruction in late February. Before mid-winter break, students brought in various household items, like paper towel rolls, round toothpicks, empty coffee cans or oatmeal containers, and rubber bands to make their own musical instruments. After mid-winter break, students brought a CD with a song or songs that have meaning to them and their family. Thanks James for sharing your time, dedication and love of music with the kindergarteners.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOver winter break, K1 students participated in a voluntary writing exercise where they write a daily journal about their experiences during the break.

The Atom Smashers, along with three other Q300 teams—Mini-figures, Senior Tech, and the XXL Fluffy Bunnies—had competed in the First Lego League Queens Invitational tournament. Principal Willard, Betty, the Vassar student intern, and many, many parents were there to cheer them all on! Con- gratulations to all the teams for their hard work!

Each class has 15 students and occurs on Wednesdays and Fridays. Please submit your student’s rental form, if you have not done so yet.\n\nThe students recently visited the Ancient Egyptian art hall at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The trip was in connection with their humanities unit on river valley civilizations.\n\nBeginning this week, in science, the class is studying ecology and ecosystems, including water systems and environmental conditions. The unit will be embedded into the engineering lab, as students design ways to contain and clean up a river oil spill. Students will also partici- pate in computer simulations of animal population growth.\n\nIn math, the students will begin a unit of Coverings and Surroundings which focuses on two and three dimension areas. They will also design a three dimension paper container that meets specific surface area and volume standards.\n\nFirst Grade: \n\nIn science, students are studying air properties and weather. In investigating air, students are determining whether objects such feathers, foam balls, cotton balls, and balloon can be moved by and through air. Further, they have used vials, paper, towels and basins to explore the idea that air takes up space. They also constructed their own parachutes to see how air slows the descent of a parachute and have learned what bubbles can tell us about air. In their investigation of weather, students have examined and studied different weather instruments, such as a thermometer and a rain gauge. They also have looked closely at different types of clouds and the weather they bring.\n\nIn a writing unit titled, “Review,” students have been learning to write opinions. First, they brought to school collections of items, including action figures, special pencils, unique stuffed animals, figures, jewelry, shells, rock collections and collectible cards. They then drafted their views on which collection was the best and why. Some of the ideas covered in the unit included:\n1. Making sure that you stated your opinion;\n2. Providing lots of reasons for your opinion;\n3. Adding details to your opinion by saying why; \n4. Quoting experts and friends; and\n5. Talking back to the reader\n\nThe students have now begun to write reviews of books, places, games, and movies that matter to them. After seeing the play, “A White House Adventure” at Queensborough Community College on February 13, the students will write a review of the play.\n\nThe students started a new math unit this week titled “Solving Story Problems.” In this unit, they will be solving story problems, com- posing numbers using multiple addends, creating equivalent expressions, developing strategies for counting large amount of objects, and recording their responses using standard notation (>,<,+,-,=). Students will play games that help build their understanding of relationships of numbers. These games include Counters in a Cup, Five in a Row, How Many Am I Hiding?, Roll and Record, and Dot Addition.\n\nIn Physical Education, the students continue to prepare for the Fitnessgram assessment, which is a widely used physical fitness and physical activity evaluation for children. They are practicing curl-ups, push-ups, and the pacer, which is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test. They also are continuing with t-ball and have begun yoga.\n\nKindergarten. \n\nOn every Tuesday from early January through mid-February, K-1 parent James has been teaching music appreciation. His lessons are providing an important foundation for the students in preparation for Brooklyn Conservatory of Music’s music enrichment program, which will begin after the February school break. Thank you for volunteering your time James! The kindergarteners are also participating in another enrichment program, where they are practicing yoga every other Monday.\n\nParents may have noticed their child bringing home books from a higher reading level. The children use those books in reading class and should bring them back to school every day. In math, the class has been continuing to learn how to recognize, copy, extend and create patterns. In the science unit, children are learning about wood and paper.\n\nIn technology, the class continues to learn new basic programming, logic, problem solving, debugging, and creativity. Before holiday break, technology teacher Scott sent home a letter about an online course at code.org. The course is a supplement to what’s going on in school. It’s designed in a way where it’s fun for the children to practice writing code. \n\nDuring Friday’s “show and tell”, K-1 students can show one special thing and talk about it.

This new Queens school will likely be a huge success, as it will attract western and central Queens G&T students who previously would have selected NEST+M, and used the private carrier for same, or would have stayed with their local zoned for schools, due to the length and/or cost of the commute; it will also atttract Manhattan students.  However, with Queens' large and continually growing population, and its excellent calibre of students, I would hope that this is just a start.

They are the ones that pointed out that pass/fail transcripts do not compare well when compared with transcripts  with actual grades. It is difficult for a University to decipher the difference in two students attending  the same school that have identical transcripts. One student could be a 96 student and the other and 80 student.

Every night my child has homework in every subject, with loads more for the weekend. The volume is seriously mind-blowing. Her backpack is outrageously heavy. Yes, we expect rigor. And yes, these kids are cherry-picked and are some of the hardest working academic achievers in Queens. Yet, we haven\'t observed that teachers read over this homework enough to offer ""actionable feedback""—comments and corrections that help students get better. Often, kids read other kids\' homework and comment on it. That\'s all the feedback there is. Several teachers take weeks to grade and return tests. One sprang a bunch of grades on the students right before progress reports were distributed. There\'s not much nurture. Many of my child\'s classmates are enrolled in SHSAT prep classes, already aiming for other selective high schools. I predict a mass exodus after eighth grade much like the previous two years. It\'s a pity because the kids are so talented.', ""My 8th Grader loves BSGE and is staying for high school, as are many of her friends.  The homework load is comparable to that in other accelerated programs, like at NEST, Anderson and Hunter in middle school and all competitive high schools when you get to that level - which can be crushing at first, but then the kids sort how to get it done and it is doable.\n\nIt's true many kids leave for specialized high schools, but most of those kids came to BSGE planning to leave for high school and knowing that BSGE's rigorous curriculum would get them super well prepared for the SHSAT.    What's truly sad is that so many who come to BSGE as 7th Graders already planning to leave for high school and never really invest in the community.\n\nThe thing most special about BSGE to my 8th Grader is the level, and character, of in-class discourse (which is different from her previous honors program).  BSGE grows minds that think critically and analyze 360 degrees around an issue. The IB exams the kids take in 11th and 12th Grade are multi-part and, depending on subject, comprised of oral, written and project presentation.  Curriculum in grades 7-10 is designed, across subjects, to help the kids develop the skills they need to be able to do that.  BSGE's success in that is evident in it's 84% IB Diploma pass rate (highest in NYC!).  And, if you talk to the older kids, they are deep - not just academically capable, but thoughtful,  intellectually well rounded, and with perspective that reaches way beyond self.  \n\nBSGE is a different education than the AP-centric or Early College schools - although it's Ivy College placement, and aid, are on par, or better than all (e.g., in each of last few years a student has been fully funded for all 4 years at Yale).  It' also not not for everyone."", 'It is  different and great that KIDS learn a lot, high school is not the end of the education, getting into a great University is the goal. The kids do learn a lot and are taught to think independently, how does that translate to their transcript when applying for College. Where do the majority of the students get into, not one or two of the best students in the school. I had an opportunity to visit the school this year and I was not impressed with the wall reflecting where the seniors were admitted to compared to other comparable challenging high schools that I have visited. If the HS rating was the ultimate goal than the school has little flaws, but if the school is a stepping stone to a highly rated University, I am not certain that the school is doing their best for the students once they graduate, the brilliance and overall challenge of the program should not be a secret to the universities and the graduating students transcript do not compare on paper to other schools less challenging thus the handful of students who would have been admitted to an Ivy league school regardless of the HS they were enrolled in will get into the Ivy league school, how about the rest of the students? As a parent of a 8th grader do not lose the goal of the ultimate trip which is University placement and one should not judge the HS  by state exams but by the schools willingness to help the students after they are no longer students by insuring that their transcript fairly represents the individual students success in High School. The School has been one of my favorite schools to send my daughter and I am sure the curriculum will make her a better student and person but how will the school help her get into the next educational phase of her life? It cannot be a coincidence that so many 8th graders decide to move forward for HS, I suggest that the school actually did help them think about their future during their stay and the future unfortunately may look brighter some place else. Food for thought for the school staff.', ""Well, first, you should look at this year's college placements.  Next, you should consider that some of what you see is based on financial circumstances of our diverse community -  the great majority of which can not afford private university and any price and/or are unwilling to send their children away to school (which in some part explains why you see so may NY State and CUNY admissions).  Also, with respect to Ivy's, BSGE's Ivy admit percent is on par with the most notorious NYC public schools - and BSGE's college admit has for years included truly great liberal arts and humanities based institutions like Wesleyan, Oberlin and Colby - schools where IB Diploma and the critical thinking it connotes is valued.   Next, I note BSGE has added Regents Chemistry and Regents Physics courses in 9th and 10th Grades, respectively - which speaks to leveling comparison to other competitive schools.  Some families are always just going to prefer Specialized High Schools and BSGE is never going to be the high school for kids from those families.  But the thing that really sets BSGE apart is the commitment and dedication of its principle, Kelly Johnson, her staff and the teachers.

While the DOE HS directory does not show how many students actually did apply for 10th grade admission in 2016, those are likely slim odds.  4) The school is an IB program school, with students largely entering the school in 7th grade.  IB classes are much more rigorous than AP classes. If you did not take Regents classes in middle school and also have not already taken AP classes at your current high school, you would be behind the school\'s other students for 10th grade, which would make you an unlikely candidate to be accepted. 5) Mid-year transfers tend to be limited to so-called ""safety transfers,"" where a student needs to attend another school because of having been assaulted by another student or students at his/her current school.  It is doubtful that ""if a therapist writes a report"" that you would be able to attend this specific school. DOE does not let the student pick from all schools in the City for a safety transfer. 6) Please broaden your search of high schools with transfer seats, so you have more choices.  In particular, many large high schools in Queens have solid general ed programs, with opportunities to take AP classes.  If you are already zoned for one of those schools, such as Forest Hills HS or Bayside HS, you might have a good shot applying for a transfer seat.  \n\n7)  Please register for College Now classes, which are college-level classes for high school students which are taught at CUNY (and at some high schools), and which will give you CUNY credit for college.  I think you will find that these classes provide the challenge you seek.

31R009,"['The school is great for many different reasons. First, it\'s a lottery \'unzoned\' school on Staten Island. The ideology that your child wins ""the lottery"" by receiving a seat here is undisputed. The school offers many family fun nights that really help your child transition into the school. Plus, they offer enrichment programs like Soccer, Martial Arts and Cheerleading. Second, the teachers/staff are young, fresh, energetic and enthusiastic which children find easily relatable. Principal Deanna Marco seems to have a genuine concern for the school because she started the school. The academic results of Naples reflect her leadership capabilities, and that makes her a very involved principal. One major thing that I love is that because Naples is a fairly new school, the kids are growing as the school is growing. Currently, the highest grade is first grade, and next year it will be second grade. Any concerned parent that questions how bullying may be handled in this school, can have some comfort knowing that the kids aren\'t \'that much\' bigger than your kid is (even in Pre-K). \n\nHowever, one major CON about this school is the early morning traffic problem. P.S. 48 (Wilcox) is DIRECTLY across the street and starts at the SAME EXACT TIME. So, we have the craziness that would be around any school in the morning X2. Additionally, there\'s a lovely (sarcasm) police officer that waits around the school to give parents $110 double parking tickets. If we were dropping our children off at a crack house, I can understand the distaste for parents double parking. But we are simply trying to get them into school on time after being in stand still traffic a couple of blocks down because of both schools starting at the same time. It would be WONDERFUL if Naples utilized the roundabout in the front for an all grade stop, drop and go program instead of what it\'s now being used for which is parking cars!?!\n\nLastly, despite the traffic/ticket/late issue that you may experience in the morning, this is a wonderful school with a great staff. What more do you want for your child than an outstanding environment where they can flourish? ', ""I agree with the previous 2 comments; there is school staff outside rain or shine helping kids come out the cars. There is no need to double park if you're following the flow of the stop, drop and go procedure. There is tons of traffic but that's literally any school zone in the morning and in general, there's tons of congestion everywhere in the mornings."", '<i>But we are simply trying to get them into school on time after being in standstill traffic a couple of blocks down because of both schools starting \nat the same time.</i>\n\nPark further away and walk.', ""The school actually has a great stop and drop system which is a major perk (much better than using the roundabout, which will create all sorts of problems). The teachers, paras, and aids will assist children out of their cars and make sure they enter the building safely. In the winter, I experienced them lifting children over snow banks! \n\n\nParents that double park interfere with the stop and drop system and put everyone at risk of an accident. I have no problem with the cops being there and giving out tickets. The school opens a 1/2 hour early for free breakfast and there's plenty of street parking at that time. I agree that Targee is quite congested, but the extra light has helped things out (as long as everyone follows the law, rules and gives themselves extra time in the morning).\n\n\n\nAnd, yes, the school is awesome."", 'My daughter was picked for the fall and I am so relieved and excited for her!!!

The principal routinely tells students at public assemblies that the children are loved by the staff and parents. The arts are thriving, and I love that there is PE twice a week. All the staff and the afterschool people know the students\' names. \n\nThe school went to uniforms just as my daughter entered it, and I can\'t believe how much I love that! No fights in the morning about clothes! \nAnd you save so much money on clothes! \n\nMy child has some learning and behavioral problems, so she is in the CTT class. Teachers and staff work with her as a team in a coordinated way and we have seen incredible results. She is doing so well I have to pinch myself sometimes. \n\nThe homework requirements are manageable and age-appropriate, unlike at a previous school my child attended in Brooklyn, where teachers would throw15 worksheet pages at my child in kindergarten. The school is rigorous enough, but they rightly get the students to do most of work in school. The homework reinforces the work done in school, rather than asking students to learn new concepts at home, which is what appeared to be happening in the previous school my child attended. \n\nPS 13 could do a lot more to get parents involved and make the school a community hub. For example, my older daughter attended one of the top elementary schools in Brooklyn. Once a month, on a Friday morning, parents are invited into their children\'s classrooms for an hour as part of ""Parents as Learning Partners."" (Obviously, grandparents or other guardians can go instead of parents.)  Parents would then either make art with the children, or read and write comments on the children\'s stories, or read with the children, or play math games, depending on the theme or curricular objective that the teachers decided on. It was a great way for parents to see what was going on in the classrooms, meet other parents, learn about the curriculum, and feel invested in the school. The PTA also then had more access to the parents as they came in and out and could sell T-shirts, post announcements, etc. It was a real win-win. Sometimes they even served coffee in the lobby, and parents stood around for a few minutes and chatted before going off to work or wherever. \n\nAlso, in all the schools both of my children have been in before this one, there was a class list every year. People could opt out if they did not want to be on this list. With the class list, people could easily make playdates, invite friends to birthday parties, and take up a collection for gifts for teachers at the end of the year. For reasons I simply cannot understand, this practice is prohibited in PS 13. For equally unfathomable reasons, there is no class parent. In the other schools I am familiar with, the volunteer class parent really helped the teachers by sending out reminders, recruiting volunteer chaperones for class trips, and connecting parents to PTA activities. \n\nWe moved here nearly 2 years ago, and because of these restrictions, I barely know any parents at the school and my child, who is sociable and well-liked, has zero playdates. It is just impossible for me to arrange them because I work in Manhattan and have no way to meet the families of my daughter\'s friends. I can\'t get their contact information because the school won\'t allow class lists.\n\nThe strangest thing was during our first year when I tried to invite the entire class to my daughter\'s birthday party so that she could make friends in her new neighborhood. First, I tried to get a class list but was told that was not allowed, so I sent invitations to the class. The invitations were confiscated, and I was told that you are not allowed to give out invitations because children might be left out. I pointed out that I had invited the entire class, so no one would be left out.

Only problem is reaching that. You have to battle your way through 5th grade nonsense teachers and petty disengaged students in order to get into honor classes which holds teachers that are fun and actually teach you stuff and students that are engaged and helpful, but also very entertaining and funny. That is the goldilock zone of Schuyler. Only a few select teachers and a fraction of the students are like that. This school builds you up to the high school experience and so far the rigorous academics are being used quite frequently, which is a good thing; preparing you for the future. But then again, that only comes with the goldilock zone of students and teachers. Even though not so pretty on the outside, when you develop deep into the school community and reflect on what has happened over the years, Schuyler was actually a very good school. Though not being good as it used, downgrading from Brooklyn Tech having most seats taken up by Schuyler to just eight people getting into Tech now, it is still a great school and I hope that most of the 8th grade teachers, who are the best at giving rigorous yet engaging instruction with them having the most years at the school, still teach to this day and in the future. In short, great school concept, amazing staff, 5th 6th grade teachers needs work, 7th 8th grade teacher absolutely amazing, school environment is ok, students terrible, and only a fraction, (like those eight people that got into Brooklyn Tech + a few more academia focused) students are amazing. Make those students your best friends. (Trust me, they are great in every way.) If you like a challenge of a game, go here.

Those teachers had to be reminded that parents are collaborators in the education of their children and needed to be informed of issues before Parent Teacher Conference.  The school's website still remains horrible despite several suggestions to update it. If I was tech savvy i would do it. They could put up better room signs at the end of the hallways because it's a maze in there.  My biggest problem is that my daughter has never met with her guidance counselor!
